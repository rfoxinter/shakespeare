<p><center><i>[Enter Ferdinand bearing a log.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ferdinand</span></p>

<p>There be some sports are painful, and their labor</p>

<p>Delight in them sets off; some kinds of baseness</p>

<p>Are nobly undergone; and most poor matters</p>

<p>Point to rich ends. This my mean task</p>

<p>Would be as heavy to me as odious, but</p>

<p>The mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead</p>

<p>And makes my labors pleasures. O, she is</p>

<p>Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed,</p>

<p>And he’s composed of harshness. I must remove</p>

<p>Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,</p>

<p>Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress</p>

<p>Weeps when she sees me work, and says such</p>

<p>baseness</p>

<p>Had never like executor. I forget;</p>

<p>But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors,</p>

<p>Most busiest when I do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Miranda; and Prospero at a distance, unobserved.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Miranda</span>  Alas now, pray you,</p>

<p>Work not so hard. I would the lightning had</p>

<p>Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile.</p>

<p>Pray, set it down and rest you. When this burns</p>

<p>’Twill weep for having wearied you. My father</p>

<p>Is hard at study. Pray now, rest yourself.</p>

<p>He’s safe for these three hours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ferdinand</span>  O most dear mistress,</p>

<p>The sun will set before I shall discharge</p>

<p>What I must strive to do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Miranda</span>  If you’ll sit down,</p>

<p>I’ll bear your logs the while. Pray, give me that.</p>

<p>I’ll carry it to the pile.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ferdinand</span>  No, precious creature,</p>

<p>I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,</p>

<p>Than you should such dishonor undergo</p>

<p>While I sit lazy by.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Miranda</span>  It would become me</p>

<p>As well as it does you, and I should do it</p>

<p>With much more ease, for my good will is to it,</p>

<p>And yours it is against.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prospero</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Poor worm, thou art infected.</p>

<p>This visitation shows it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Miranda</span>  You look wearily.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Ferdinand</span></p>

<p>No, noble mistress, ’tis fresh morning with me</p>

<p>When you are by at night. I do beseech you,</p>

<p>Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers,</p>

<p>What is your name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Miranda</span>  Miranda.–O my father,</p>

<p>I have broke your hest to say so!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ferdinand</span>  Admired Miranda!</p>

<p>Indeed the top of admiration, worth</p>

<p>What’s dearest to the world! Full many a lady</p>

<p>I have eyed with best regard, and many a time</p>

<p>Th’ harmony of their tongues hath into bondage</p>

<p>Brought my too diligent ear. For several virtues</p>

<p>Have I liked several women, never any</p>

<p>With so full soul but some defect in her</p>

<p>Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,</p>

<p>And put it to the foil. But you, O you,</p>

<p>So perfect and so peerless, are created</p>

<p>Of every creature’s best.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Miranda</span>  I do not know</p>

<p>One of my sex, no woman’s face remember,</p>

<p>Save, from my glass, mine own. Nor have I seen</p>

<p>More that I may call men than you, good friend,</p>

<p>And my dear father. How features are abroad</p>

<p>I am skilless of, but by my modesty,</p>

<p>The jewel in my dower, I would not wish</p>

<p>Any companion in the world but you,</p>

<p>Nor can imagination form a shape</p>

<p>Besides yourself to like of. But I prattle</p>

<p>Something too wildly, and my father’s precepts</p>

<p>I therein do forget.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ferdinand</span>  I am in my condition</p>

<p>A prince, Miranda; I do think a king–</p>

<p>I would, not so!–and would no more endure</p>

<p>This wooden slavery than to suffer</p>

<p>The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:</p>

<p>The very instant that I saw you did</p>

<p>My heart fly to your service, there resides</p>

<p>To make me slave to it, and for your sake</p>

<p>Am I this patient log-man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Miranda</span>  Do you love me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ferdinand</span></p>

<p>O heaven, O Earth, bear witness to this sound,</p>

<p>And crown what I profess with kind event</p>

<p>If I speak true; if hollowly, invert</p>

<p>What best is boded me to mischief. I,</p>

<p>Beyond all limit of what else i’ th’ world,</p>

<p>Do love, prize, honor you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Miranda</span>  I am a fool</p>

<p>To weep at what I am glad of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prospero</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Fair encounter</p>

<p>Of two most rare affections. Heavens rain grace</p>

<p>On that which breeds between ’em!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ferdinand</span>  Wherefore</p>

<p>weep you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Miranda</span></p>

<p>At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer</p>

<p>What I desire to give, and much less take</p>

<p>What I shall die to want. But this is trifling,</p>

<p>And all the more it seeks to hide itself,</p>

<p>The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning,</p>

<p>And prompt me, plain and holy innocence.</p>

<p>I am your wife if you will marry me.</p>

<p>If not, I’ll die your maid. To be your fellow</p>

<p>You may deny me, but I’ll be your servant</p>

<p>Whether you will or no.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ferdinand</span></p>

<p>My mistress, dearest, and I thus humble ever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Miranda</span></p>

<p>My husband, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ferdinand</span>  Ay, with a heart as willing</p>

<p>As bondage e’er of freedom. Here’s my hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Miranda</span> <i>[clasping his hand]</i></p>

<p>And mine, with my heart in ’t. And now farewell</p>

<p>Till half an hour hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ferdinand</span>  A thousand thousand.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prospero</span></p>

<p>So glad of this as they I cannot be,</p>

<p>Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing</p>

<p>At nothing can be more. I’ll to my book,</p>

<p>For yet ere suppertime must I perform</p>

<p>Much business appertaining.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
