<p><center><i>[Enter Prospero and Miranda.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc></p>

<p>If by your art, my dearest father, you have</p>

<p>Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.</p>

<p>The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,</p>

<p>But that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek,</p>

<p>Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered</p>

<p>With those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,</p>

<p>Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,</p>

<p>Dashed all to pieces. O, the cry did knock</p>

<p>Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perished.</p>

<p>Had I been any god of power, I would</p>

<p>Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere</p>

<p>It should the good ship so have swallowed, and</p>

<p>The fraughting souls within her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Be collected.</p>

<p>No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart</p>

<p>There’s no harm done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  O, woe the day!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  No harm.</p>

<p>I have done nothing but in care of thee,</p>

<p>Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who</p>

<p>Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing</p>

<p>Of whence I am, nor that I am more better</p>

<p>Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,</p>

<p>And thy no greater father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  More to know</p>

<p>Did never meddle with my thoughts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  ’Tis time</p>

<p>I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand</p>

<p>And pluck my magic garment from me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Putting aside his cloak.]</i></center></p>

<p>So,</p>

<p>Lie there, my art.–Wipe thou thine eyes. Have</p>

<p>comfort.</p>

<p>The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touched</p>

<p>The very virtue of compassion in thee,</p>

<p>I have with such provision in mine art</p>

<p>So safely ordered that there is no soul–</p>

<p>No, not so much perdition as an hair,</p>

<p>Betid to any creature in the vessel</p>

<p>Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit</p>

<p>down,</p>

<p>For thou must now know farther.     <i><i>[They sit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  You have often</p>

<p>Begun to tell me what I am, but stopped</p>

<p>And left me to a bootless inquisition,</p>

<p>Concluding “Stay. Not yet.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  The hour’s now come.</p>

<p>The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.</p>

<p>Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember</p>

<p>A time before we came unto this cell?</p>

<p>I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not</p>

<p>Out three years old.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  Certainly, sir, I can.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>By what? By any other house or person?</p>

<p>Of anything the image tell me that</p>

<p>Hath kept with thy remembrance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  ’Tis far off</p>

<p>And rather like a dream than an assurance</p>

<p>That my remembrance warrants. Had I not</p>

<p>Four or five women once that tended me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it</p>

<p>That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else</p>

<p>In the dark backward and abysm of time?</p>

<p>If thou rememb’rest aught ere thou cam’st here,</p>

<p>How thou cam’st here thou mayst.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  But that I do not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,</p>

<p>Thy father was the Duke of Milan and</p>

<p>A prince of power.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  Sir, are not you my father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and</p>

<p>She said thou wast my daughter. And thy father</p>

<p>Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir</p>

<p>And princess no worse issued.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  O, the heavens!</p>

<p>What foul play had we that we came from thence?</p>

<p>Or blessed was ’t we did?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Both, both, my girl.</p>

<p>By foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence,</p>

<p>But blessedly holp hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  O, my heart bleeds</p>

<p>To think o’ th’ teen that I have turned you to,</p>

<p>Which is from my remembrance. Please you,</p>

<p>farther.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio–</p>

<p>I pray thee, mark me–that a brother should</p>

<p>Be so perfidious!–he whom next thyself</p>

<p>Of all the world I loved, and to him put</p>

<p>The manage of my state, as at that time</p>

<p>Through all the signories it was the first,</p>

<p>And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed</p>

<p>In dignity, and for the liberal arts</p>

<p>Without a parallel. Those being all my study,</p>

<p>The government I cast upon my brother</p>

<p>And to my state grew stranger, being transported</p>

<p>And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle–</p>

<p>Dost thou attend me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  Sir, most heedfully.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Being once perfected how to grant suits,</p>

<p>How to deny them, who t’ advance, and who</p>

<p>To trash for overtopping, new created</p>

<p>The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed ’em,</p>

<p>Or else new formed ’em, having both the key</p>

<p>Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ th’ state</p>

<p>To what tune pleased his ear, that now he was</p>

<p>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk</p>

<p>And sucked my verdure out on ’t. Thou attend’st not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc></p>

<p>O, good sir, I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  I pray thee, mark me.</p>

<p>I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated</p>

<p>To closeness and the bettering of my mind</p>

<p>With that which, but by being so retired,</p>

<p>O’erprized all popular rate, in my false brother</p>

<p>Awaked an evil nature, and my trust,</p>

<p>Like a good parent, did beget of him</p>

<p>A falsehood in its contrary as great</p>

<p>As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,</p>

<p>A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,</p>

<p>Not only with what my revenue yielded</p>

<p>But what my power might else exact, like one</p>

<p>Who, having into truth by telling of it,</p>

<p>Made such a sinner of his memory</p>

<p>To credit his own lie, he did believe</p>

<p>He was indeed the Duke, out o’ th’ substitution</p>

<p>And executing th’ outward face of royalty</p>

<p>With all prerogative. Hence, his ambition growing–</p>

<p>Dost thou hear?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc></p>

<p>Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>To have no screen between this part he played</p>

<p>And him he played it for, he needs will be</p>

<p>Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library</p>

<p>Was dukedom large enough. Of temporal royalties</p>

<p>He thinks me now incapable; confederates,</p>

<p>So dry he was for sway, wi’ th’ King of Naples</p>

<p>To give him annual tribute, do him homage,</p>

<p>Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend</p>

<p>The dukedom, yet unbowed–alas, poor Milan!–</p>

<p>To most ignoble stooping.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  O, the heavens!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Mark his condition and th’ event. Then tell me</p>

<p>If this might be a brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  I should sin</p>

<p>To think but nobly of my grandmother.</p>

<p>Good wombs have borne bad sons.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Now the condition.</p>

<p>This King of Naples, being an enemy</p>

<p>To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit,</p>

<p>Which was that he, in lieu o’ th’ premises</p>

<p>Of homage and I know not how much tribute,</p>

<p>Should presently extirpate me and mine</p>

<p>Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,</p>

<p>With all the honors, on my brother; whereon,</p>

<p>A treacherous army levied, one midnight</p>

<p>Fated to th’ purpose did Antonio open</p>

<p>The gates of Milan, and i’ th’ dead of darkness</p>

<p>The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence</p>

<p>Me and thy crying self.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  Alack, for pity!</p>

<p>I, not rememb’ring how I cried out then,</p>

<p>Will cry it o’er again. It is a hint</p>

<p>That wrings mine eyes to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Hear a little further,</p>

<p>And then I’ll bring thee to the present business</p>

<p>Which now ’s upon ’s, without the which this story</p>

<p>Were most impertinent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  Wherefore did they not</p>

<p>That hour destroy us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Well demanded, wench.</p>

<p>My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,</p>

<p>So dear the love my people bore me, nor set</p>

<p>A mark so bloody on the business, but</p>

<p>With colors fairer painted their foul ends.</p>

<p>In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,</p>

<p>Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared</p>

<p>A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigged,</p>

<p>Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats</p>

<p>Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us</p>

<p>To cry to th’ sea that roared to us, to sigh</p>

<p>To th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again,</p>

<p>Did us but loving wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  Alack, what trouble</p>

<p>Was I then to you!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  O, a cherubin</p>

<p>Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,</p>

<p>Infused with a fortitude from heaven,</p>

<p>When I have decked the sea with drops full salt,</p>

<p>Under my burden groaned, which raised in me</p>

<p>An undergoing stomach to bear up</p>

<p>Against what should ensue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  How came we ashore?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  By providence divine.</p>

<p>Some food we had, and some fresh water, that</p>

<p>A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,</p>

<p>Out of his charity, who being then appointed</p>

<p>Master of this design, did give us, with</p>

<p>Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,</p>

<p>Which since have steaded much. So, of his</p>

<p>gentleness,</p>

<p>Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me</p>

<p>From mine own library with volumes that</p>

<p>I prize above my dukedom.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  Would I might</p>

<p>But ever see that man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[standing]</i>  Now I arise.</p>

<p>Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.</p>

<p>Here in this island we arrived, and here</p>

<p>Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit</p>

<p>Than other princes can, that have more time</p>

<p>For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc></p>

<p>Heavens thank you for ’t. And now I pray you, sir–</p>

<p>For still ’tis beating in my mind–your reason</p>

<p>For raising this sea storm?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Know thus far forth:</p>

<p>By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,</p>

<p>Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies</p>

<p>Brought to this shore; and by my prescience</p>

<p>I find my zenith doth depend upon</p>

<p>A most auspicious star, whose influence</p>

<p>If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes</p>

<p>Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions.</p>

<p>Thou art inclined to sleep. ’Tis a good dullness,</p>

<p>And give it way. I know thou canst not choose.</p>

<p><center><i>[Miranda falls asleep.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Prospero puts on his cloak.]</i></center></p>

<p>Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.</p>

<p>Approach, my Ariel. Come.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ariel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>All hail, great master! Grave sir, hail! I come</p>

<p>To answer thy best pleasure. Be ’t to fly,</p>

<p>To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride</p>

<p>On the curled clouds, to thy strong bidding task</p>

<p>Ariel and all his quality.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Hast thou, spirit,</p>

<p>Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  To every article.</p>

<p>I boarded the King’s ship; now on the beak,</p>

<p>Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,</p>

<p>I flamed amazement. Sometimes I’d divide</p>

<p>And burn in many places. On the topmast,</p>

<p>The yards, and bowsprit would I flame distinctly,</p>

<p>Then meet and join. Jove’s lightning, the precursors</p>

<p>O’ th’ dreadful thunderclaps, more momentary</p>

<p>And sight-outrunning were not. The fire and cracks</p>

<p>Of sulfurous roaring the most mighty Neptune</p>

<p>Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,</p>

<p>Yea, his dread trident shake.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  My brave spirit!</p>

<p>Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil</p>

<p>Would not infect his reason?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Not a soul</p>

<p>But felt a fever of the mad, and played</p>

<p>Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners</p>

<p>Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,</p>

<p>Then all afire with me. The King’s son, Ferdinand,</p>

<p>With hair up-staring–then like reeds, not hair–</p>

<p>Was the first man that leaped; cried “Hell is empty,</p>

<p>And all the devils are here.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Why, that’s my spirit!</p>

<p>But was not this nigh shore?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Close by, my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>But are they, Ariel, safe?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Not a hair perished.</p>

<p>On their sustaining garments not a blemish,</p>

<p>But fresher than before; and, as thou bad’st me,</p>

<p>In troops I have dispersed them ’bout the isle.</p>

<p>The King’s son have I landed by himself,</p>

<p>Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs</p>

<p>In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,</p>

<p>His arms in this sad knot.     <i><i>[He folds his arms.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Of the King’s ship,</p>

<p>The mariners say how thou hast disposed,</p>

<p>And all the rest o’ th’ fleet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Safely in harbor</p>

<p>Is the King’s ship. In the deep nook, where once</p>

<p>Thou called’st me up at midnight to fetch dew</p>

<p>From the still-vexed Bermoothes, there she’s hid;</p>

<p>The mariners all under hatches stowed,</p>

<p>Who, with a charm joined to their suffered labor,</p>

<p>I have left asleep. And for the rest o’ th’ fleet,</p>

<p>Which I dispersed, they all have met again</p>

<p>And are upon the Mediterranean float,</p>

<p>Bound sadly home for Naples,</p>

<p>Supposing that they saw the King’s ship wracked</p>

<p>And his great person perish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Ariel, thy charge</p>

<p>Exactly is performed. But there’s more work.</p>

<p>What is the time o’ th’ day?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Past the mid season.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>At least two glasses. The time ’twixt six and now</p>

<p>Must by us both be spent most preciously.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,</p>

<p>Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,</p>

<p>Which is not yet performed me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  How now? Moody?</p>

<p>What is ’t thou canst demand?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  My liberty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Before the time be out? No more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  I prithee,</p>

<p>Remember I have done thee worthy service,</p>

<p>Told thee no lies, made no mistakings, served</p>

<p>Without or grudge or grumblings. Thou did promise</p>

<p>To bate me a full year.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Dost thou forget</p>

<p>From what a torment I did free thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Thou dost, and think’st it much to tread the ooze</p>

<p>Of the salt deep,</p>

<p>To run upon the sharp wind of the North,</p>

<p>To do me business in the veins o’ th’ Earth</p>

<p>When it is baked with frost.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  I do not, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Thou liest, malignant thing. Hast thou forgot</p>

<p>The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy</p>

<p>Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  No, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Thou hast. Where was she born? Speak. Tell me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>Sir, in Argier.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  O, was she so? I must</p>

<p>Once in a month recount what thou hast been,</p>

<p>Which thou forget’st. This damned witch Sycorax,</p>

<p>For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible</p>

<p>To enter human hearing, from Argier,</p>

<p>Thou know’st, was banished. For one thing she did</p>

<p>They would not take her life. Is not this true?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Ay, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child</p>

<p>And here was left by th’ sailors. Thou, my slave,</p>

<p>As thou report’st thyself, was then her servant,</p>

<p>And for thou wast a spirit too delicate</p>

<p>To act her earthy and abhorred commands,</p>

<p>Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,</p>

<p>By help of her more potent ministers</p>

<p>And in her most unmitigable rage,</p>

<p>Into a cloven pine, within which rift</p>

<p>Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain</p>

<p>A dozen years; within which space she died</p>

<p>And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans</p>

<p>As fast as mill wheels strike. Then was this island</p>

<p>(Save for the son that she did litter here,</p>

<p>A freckled whelp, hag-born) not honored with</p>

<p>A human shape.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Yes, Caliban, her son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban</p>

<p>Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know’st</p>

<p>What torment I did find thee in. Thy groans</p>

<p>Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts</p>

<p>Of ever-angry bears. It was a torment</p>

<p>To lay upon the damned, which Sycorax</p>

<p>Could not again undo. It was mine art,</p>

<p>When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape</p>

<p>The pine and let thee out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  I thank thee, master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak</p>

<p>And peg thee in his knotty entrails till</p>

<p>Thou hast howled away twelve winters.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Pardon, master.</p>

<p>I will be correspondent to command</p>

<p>And do my spriting gently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Do so, and after two days</p>

<p>I will discharge thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  That’s my noble master.</p>

<p>What shall I do? Say, what? What shall I do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Go make thyself like a nymph o’ th’ sea. Be subject</p>

<p>To no sight but thine and mine, invisible</p>

<p>To every eyeball else. Go, take this shape,</p>

<p>And hither come in ’t. Go, hence with diligence!</p>

<p><center><i>[Ariel exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Awake, dear heart, awake. Thou hast slept well.</p>

<p>Awake.     <i><i>[Miranda wakes.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  The strangeness of your story put</p>

<p>Heaviness in me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Shake it off. Come on,</p>

<p>We’ll visit Caliban, my slave, who never</p>

<p>Yields us kind answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc> <i>[rising]</i>  ’Tis a villain, sir,</p>

<p>I do not love to look on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  But, as ’tis,</p>

<p>We cannot miss him. He does make our fire,</p>

<p>Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices</p>

<p>That profit us.–What ho, slave, Caliban!</p>

<p>Thou earth, thou, speak!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc> <i>[within]</i>  There’s wood enough within.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Come forth, I say. There’s other business for thee.</p>

<p>Come, thou tortoise. When?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ariel like a water nymph.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,</p>

<p>Hark in thine ear.     <i><i>[He whispers to Ariel.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  My lord, it shall be done.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[to Caliban]</i></p>

<p>Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself</p>

<p>Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Caliban.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc></p>

<p>As wicked dew as e’er my mother brushed</p>

<p>With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen</p>

<p>Drop on you both. A southwest blow on you</p>

<p>And blister you all o’er.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps,</p>

<p>Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up. Urchins</p>

<p>Shall forth at vast of night that they may work</p>

<p>All exercise on thee. Thou shalt be pinched</p>

<p>As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging</p>

<p>Than bees that made ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  I must eat my dinner.</p>

<p>This island’s mine by Sycorax, my mother,</p>

<p>Which thou tak’st from me. When thou cam’st first,</p>

<p>Thou strok’st me and made much of me, wouldst</p>

<p>give me</p>

<p>Water with berries in ’t, and teach me how</p>

<p>To name the bigger light and how the less,</p>

<p>That burn by day and night. And then I loved thee,</p>

<p>And showed thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle,</p>

<p>The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place and</p>

<p>fertile.</p>

<p>Cursed be I that did so! All the charms</p>

<p>Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you,</p>

<p>For I am all the subjects that you have,</p>

<p>Which first was mine own king; and here you sty me</p>

<p>In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me</p>

<p>The rest o’ th’ island.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Thou most lying slave,</p>

<p>Whom stripes may move, not kindness, I have used</p>

<p>thee,</p>

<p>Filth as thou art, with humane care, and lodged</p>

<p>thee</p>

<p>In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate</p>

<p>The honor of my child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc></p>

<p>O ho, O ho! Would ’t had been done!</p>

<p>Thou didst prevent me. I had peopled else</p>

<p>This isle with Calibans.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  Abhorred slave,</p>

<p>Which any print of goodness wilt not take,</p>

<p>Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,</p>

<p>Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each</p>

<p>hour</p>

<p>One thing or other. When thou didst not, savage,</p>

<p>Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like</p>

<p>A thing most brutish, I endowed thy purposes</p>

<p>With words that made them known. But thy vile</p>

<p>race,</p>

<p>Though thou didst learn, had that in ’t which good</p>

<p>natures</p>

<p>Could not abide to be with. Therefore wast thou</p>

<p>Deservedly confined into this rock,</p>

<p>Who hadst deserved more than a prison.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc></p>

<p>You taught me language, and my profit on ’t</p>

<p>Is I know how to curse. The red plague rid you</p>

<p>For learning me your language!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Hagseed, hence!</p>

<p>Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou ’rt best,</p>

<p>To answer other business. Shrugg’st thou, malice?</p>

<p>If thou neglect’st or dost unwillingly</p>

<p>What I command, I’ll rack thee with old cramps,</p>

<p>Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar</p>

<p>That beasts shall tremble at thy din.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  No, pray thee.</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> I must obey. His art is of such power</p>

<p>It would control my dam’s god, Setebos,</p>

<p>And make a vassal of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  So, slave, hence.</p>

<p><center><i>[Caliban exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ferdinand; and Ariel, invisible,</p>

<p>playing and singing.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Song.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Come unto these yellow sands,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And then take hands.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Curtsied when you have, and kissed</i></p>

<p>        <i>The wild waves whist.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Foot it featly here and there,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And sweet sprites bear</i></p>

<p>     <i>The burden. Hark, hark!</i></p>

<p>           <i><i>[Burden dispersedly, within:]</i> Bow-wow.</i></p>

<p>        <i>The watchdogs bark.</i></p>

<p>           <i><i>[Burden dispersedly, within:]</i> Bow-wow.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Hark, hark! I hear</i></p>

<p>     <i>The strain of strutting chanticleer</i></p>

<p>        <i>Cry cock-a-diddle-dow.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc></p>

<p>Where should this music be? I’ th’ air, or th’ earth?</p>

<p>It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon</p>

<p>Some god o’ th’ island. Sitting on a bank,</p>

<p>Weeping again the King my father’s wrack,</p>

<p>This music crept by me upon the waters,</p>

<p>Allaying both their fury and my passion</p>

<p>With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it,</p>

<p>Or it hath drawn me rather. But ’tis gone.</p>

<p>No, it begins again.</p>

<br/>

<p>Song.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Full fathom five thy father lies.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Of his bones are coral made.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Those are pearls that were his eyes.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Nothing of him that doth fade</i></p>

<p>     <i>But doth suffer a sea change</i></p>

<p>     <i>Into something rich and strange.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell.</i></p>

<p>          <i><i>[Burden, within:]</i> Ding dong.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Hark, now I hear them: ding dong bell.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc></p>

<p>The ditty does remember my drowned father.</p>

<p>This is no mortal business, nor no sound</p>

<p>That the Earth owes. I hear it now above me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[to Miranda]</i></p>

<p>The fringed curtains of thine eye advance</p>

<p>And say what thou seest yond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  What is ’t? A spirit?</p>

<p>Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,</p>

<p>It carries a brave form. But ’tis a spirit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>No, wench, it eats and sleeps and hath such senses</p>

<p>As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest</p>

<p>Was in the wrack; and, but he’s something stained</p>

<p>With grief–that’s beauty’s canker–thou might’st</p>

<p>call him</p>

<p>A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows</p>

<p>And strays about to find ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  I might call him</p>

<p>A thing divine, for nothing natural</p>

<p>I ever saw so noble.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  It goes on, I see,</p>

<p>As my soul prompts it. <i>[To Ariel.]</i> Spirit, fine spirit,</p>

<p>I’ll free thee</p>

<p>Within two days for this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc> <i>[seeing Miranda]</i>  Most sure, the goddess</p>

<p>On whom these airs attend!–Vouchsafe my prayer</p>

<p>May know if you remain upon this island,</p>

<p>And that you will some good instruction give</p>

<p>How I may bear me here. My prime request,</p>

<p>Which I do last pronounce, is–O you wonder!–</p>

<p>If you be maid or no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  No wonder, sir,</p>

<p>But certainly a maid.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc>  My language! Heavens!</p>

<p>I am the best of them that speak this speech,</p>

<p>Were I but where ’tis spoken.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  How? The best?</p>

<p>What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc></p>

<p>A single thing, as I am now, that wonders</p>

<p>To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me,</p>

<p>And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,</p>

<p>Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld</p>

<p>The King my father wracked.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  Alack, for mercy!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc></p>

<p>Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan</p>

<p>And his brave son being twain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  The Duke of Milan</p>

<p>And his more braver daughter could control thee,</p>

<p>If now ’twere fit to do ’t. At the first sight</p>

<p>They have changed eyes.–Delicate Ariel,</p>

<p>I’ll set thee free for this. <i>[To Ferdinand.]</i> A word,</p>

<p>good sir.</p>

<p>I fear you have done yourself some wrong. A word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc></p>

<p>Why speaks my father so ungently? This</p>

<p>Is the third man that e’er I saw, the first</p>

<p>That e’er I sighed for. Pity move my father</p>

<p>To be inclined my way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc>  O, if a virgin,</p>

<p>And your affection not gone forth, I’ll make you</p>

<p>The Queen of Naples.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Soft, sir, one word more.</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> They are both in either’s powers. But this</p>

<p>swift business</p>

<p>I must uneasy make, lest too light winning</p>

<p>Make the prize light. <i>[To Ferdinand.]</i> One word</p>

<p>more. I charge thee</p>

<p>That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp</p>

<p>The name thou ow’st not, and hast put thyself</p>

<p>Upon this island as a spy, to win it</p>

<p>From me, the lord on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc>  No, as I am a man!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc></p>

<p>There’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.</p>

<p>If the ill spirit have so fair a house,</p>

<p>Good things will strive to dwell with ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[to Ferdinand]</i>  Follow me.</p>

<p><i>[To Miranda.]</i> Speak not you for him. He’s a traitor.</p>

<p><i>[To Ferdinand.]</i> Come,</p>

<p>I’ll manacle thy neck and feet together.</p>

<p>Sea water shalt thou drink. Thy food shall be</p>

<p>The fresh-brook mussels, withered roots, and husks</p>

<p>Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc>  No,</p>

<p>I will resist such entertainment till</p>

<p>Mine enemy has more power.</p>

<p><center><i>[He draws, and is charmed from moving.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  O dear father,</p>

<p>Make not too rash a trial of him, for</p>

<p>He’s gentle and not fearful.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  What, I say,</p>

<p>My foot my tutor?–Put thy sword up, traitor,</p>

<p>Who mak’st a show, but dar’st not strike, thy</p>

<p>conscience</p>

<p>Is so possessed with guilt. Come from thy ward,</p>

<p>For I can here disarm thee with this stick</p>

<p>And make thy weapon drop.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  Beseech you, father–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Hence! Hang not on my garments.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  Sir, have pity.</p>

<p>I’ll be his surety.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Silence! One word more</p>

<p>Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What,</p>

<p>An advocate for an impostor? Hush.</p>

<p>Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he,</p>

<p>Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench,</p>

<p>To th’ most of men this is a Caliban,</p>

<p>And they to him are angels.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  My affections</p>

<p>Are then most humble. I have no ambition</p>

<p>To see a goodlier man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[to Ferdinand]</i>  Come on, obey.</p>

<p>Thy nerves are in their infancy again</p>

<p>And have no vigor in them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc>  So they are.</p>

<p>My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.</p>

<p>My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel,</p>

<p>The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats</p>

<p>To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,</p>

<p>Might I but through my prison once a day</p>

<p>Behold this maid. All corners else o’ th’ Earth</p>

<p>Let liberty make use of. Space enough</p>

<p>Have I in such a prison.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  It works.–Come on.–</p>

<p>Thou hast done well, fine Ariel.–Follow me.</p>

<p><i>[To Ariel.]</i> Hark what thou else shalt do me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc> <i>[to Ferdinand]</i>  Be of</p>

<p>comfort.</p>

<p>My father’s of a better nature, sir,</p>

<p>Than he appears by speech. This is unwonted</p>

<p>Which now came from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[to Ariel]</i>  Thou shalt be as free</p>

<p>As mountain winds; but then exactly do</p>

<p>All points of my command.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  To th’ syllable.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[to Ferdinand]</i></p>
