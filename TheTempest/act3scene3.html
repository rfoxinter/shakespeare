<p><center><i>[Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian,</p>

<p>Francisco, etc.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gonzalo</sc></p>

<p>By ’r lakin, I can go no further, sir.</p>

<p>My old bones aches. Here’s a maze trod indeed</p>

<p>Through forthrights and meanders. By your</p>

<p>patience,</p>

<p>I needs must rest me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  Old lord, I cannot blame thee.</p>

<p>Who am myself attached with weariness</p>

<p>To th’ dulling of my spirits. Sit down and rest.</p>

<p>Even here I will put off my hope and keep it</p>

<p>No longer for my flatterer. He is drowned</p>

<p>Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks</p>

<p>Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc> <i>[aside to Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>I am right glad that he’s so out of hope.</p>

<p>Do not, for one repulse, forgo the purpose</p>

<p>That you resolved t’ effect.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc> <i>[aside to Antonio]</i>  The next advantage</p>

<p>Will we take throughly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc> <i>[aside to Sebastian]</i>  Let it be tonight;</p>

<p>For now they are oppressed with travel, they</p>

<p>Will not nor cannot use such vigilance</p>

<p>As when they are fresh.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc> <i>[aside to Antonio]</i>  I say tonight. No more.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Solemn and strange music, and enter Prospero on the</p>

<p>top invisible.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc></p>

<p>What harmony is this? My good friends, hark.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gonzalo</sc>  Marvelous sweet music!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter several strange shapes, bringing in a banquet, and</p>

<p>dance about it with gentle actions of salutations.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc></p>

<p>Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc></p>

<p>A living drollery! Now I will believe</p>

<p>That there are unicorns, that in Arabia</p>

<p>There is one tree, the phoenix’ throne, one phoenix</p>

<p>At this hour reigning there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  I’ll believe both;</p>

<p>And what does else want credit, come to me</p>

<p>And I’ll be sworn ’tis true. Travelers ne’er did lie,</p>

<p>Though fools at home condemn ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gonzalo</sc>  If in Naples</p>

<p>I should report this now, would they believe me?</p>

<p>If I should say I saw such islanders–</p>

<p>For, certes, these are people of the island–</p>

<p>Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet note</p>

<p>Their manners are more gentle, kind, than of</p>

<p>Our human generation you shall find</p>

<p>Many, nay, almost any.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Honest lord,</p>

<p>Thou hast said well, for some of you there present</p>

<p>Are worse than devils.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  I cannot too much muse</p>

<p>Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound,</p>

<p>expressing–</p>

<p>Although they want the use of tongue–a kind</p>

<p>Of excellent dumb discourse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Praise in departing.</p>

<p><center><i>[Inviting the King, etc., to eat, the shapes depart.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francisco</sc>  They vanished strangely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  No matter, since</p>

<p>They have left their viands behind, for we have</p>

<p>stomachs.</p>

<p>Will ’t please you taste of what is here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  Not I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gonzalo</sc></p>

<p>Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,</p>

<p>Who would believe that there were mountaineers</p>

<p>Dewlapped like bulls, whose throats had hanging at</p>

<p>’em</p>

<p>Wallets of flesh? Or that there were such men</p>

<p>Whose heads stood in their breasts? Which now we</p>

<p>find</p>

<p>Each putter-out of five for one will bring us</p>

<p>Good warrant of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  I will stand to and feed.</p>

<p>Although my last, no matter, since I feel</p>

<p>The best is past. Brother, my lord the Duke,</p>

<p>Stand to, and do as we.</p>

<p><center><i>[Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio</p>

<p>move toward the table.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Thunder and lightning. Enter Ariel, like a Harpy, claps</p>

<p>his wings upon the table, and with a quaint device the</p>

<p>banquet vanishes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc> <i>[as Harpy]</i></p>

<p>You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,</p>

<p>That hath to instrument this lower world</p>

<p>And what is in ’t, the never-surfeited sea</p>

<p>Hath caused to belch up you, and on this island,</p>

<p>Where man doth not inhabit, you ’mongst men</p>

<p>Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;</p>

<p>And even with such-like valor, men hang and drown</p>

<p>Their proper selves.</p>

<p><center><i>[Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio draw their swords.]</i></center></p>

<p>You fools, I and my fellows</p>

<p>Are ministers of Fate. The elements</p>

<p>Of whom your swords are tempered may as well</p>

<p>Wound the loud winds or with bemocked-at stabs</p>

<p>Kill the still-closing waters as diminish</p>

<p>One dowl that’s in my plume. My fellow ministers</p>

<p>Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,</p>

<p>Your swords are now too massy for your strengths</p>

<p>And will not be uplifted. But remember–</p>

<p>For that’s my business to you–that you three</p>

<p>From Milan did supplant good Prospero,</p>

<p>Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,</p>

<p>Him and his innocent child, for which foul deed,</p>

<p>The powers–delaying, not forgetting–have</p>

<p>Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures</p>

<p>Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,</p>

<p>They have bereft; and do pronounce by me</p>

<p>Ling’ring perdition, worse than any death</p>

<p>Can be at once, shall step by step attend</p>

<p>You and your ways, whose wraths to guard you</p>

<p>from–</p>

<p>Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls</p>

<p>Upon your heads–is nothing but heart’s sorrow</p>

<p>And a clear life ensuing.     <i><i>[He vanishes in thunder.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Then, to soft music, enter the shapes again, and dance,</p>

<p>with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Bravely the figure of this Harpy hast thou</p>

<p>Performed, my Ariel. A grace it had, devouring.</p>

<p>Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated</p>

<p>In what thou hadst to say. So, with good life</p>

<p>And observation strange, my meaner ministers</p>

<p>Their several kinds have done. My high charms</p>

<p>work,</p>

<p>And these mine enemies are all knit up</p>

<p>In their distractions. They now are in my power;</p>

<p>And in these fits I leave them while I visit</p>

<p>Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drowned,</p>

<p>And his and mine loved darling.     <i><i>[He exits, above.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gonzalo</sc> <i>[to Alonso]</i></p>

<p>I’ th’ name of something holy, sir, why stand you</p>

<p>In this strange stare?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  O, it is monstrous, monstrous!</p>

<p>Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;</p>

<p>The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,</p>

<p>That deep and dreadful organ pipe, pronounced</p>

<p>The name of Prosper. It did bass my trespass.</p>

<p>Therefor my son i’ th’ ooze is bedded, and</p>

<p>I’ll seek him deeper than e’er plummet sounded,</p>

<p>And with him there lie mudded.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  But one fiend at a time,</p>

<p>I’ll fight their legions o’er.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  I’ll be thy second.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gonzalo</sc></p>

<p>All three of them are desperate. Their great guilt,</p>

<p>Like poison given to work a great time after,</p>

<p>Now ’gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you</p>

<p>That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly</p>

<p>And hinder them from what this ecstasy</p>

<p>May now provoke them to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adrian</sc>  Follow, I pray you.</p>

<p><center><i>[They all exit.]</i></center></p>
