<p><center><i>[Enter Caliban with a burden of wood. A noise of</p>

<p>thunder heard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc></p>

<p>All the infections that the sun sucks up</p>

<p>From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him</p>

<p>By inchmeal a disease! His spirits hear me,</p>

<p>And yet I needs must curse. But they’ll nor pinch,</p>

<p>Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i’ th’ mire,</p>

<p>Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark</p>

<p>Out of my way, unless he bid ’em. But</p>

<p>For every trifle are they set upon me,</p>

<p>Sometimes like apes, that mow and chatter at me</p>

<p>And after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which</p>

<p>Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount</p>

<p>Their pricks at my footfall. Sometime am I</p>

<p>All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues</p>

<p>Do hiss me into madness. Lo, now, lo!</p>

<p>Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me</p>

<p>For bringing wood in slowly. I’ll fall flat.</p>

<p>Perchance he will not mind me.</p>

<p><center><i>[He lies down and covers himself with a cloak.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Trinculo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off</p>

<p>any weather at all. And another storm brewing; I</p>

<p>hear it sing i’ th’ wind. Yond same black cloud, yond</p>

<p>huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed</p>

<p>his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I</p>

<p>know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud</p>

<p>cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. <i>[Noticing Caliban.]</i></p>

<p>What have we here, a man or a fish? Dead or</p>

<p>alive? A fish, he smells like a fish–a very ancient</p>

<p>and fishlike smell, a kind of not-of-the-newest poor-John.</p>

<p>A strange fish. Were I in England now, as once</p>

<p>I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday</p>

<p>fool there but would give a piece of silver. There</p>

<p>would this monster make a man. Any strange beast</p>

<p>there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to</p>

<p>relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a</p>

<p>dead Indian. Legged like a man, and his fins like</p>

<p>arms! Warm, o’ my troth! I do now let loose my</p>

<p>opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an</p>

<p>islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt.</p>

<p><i>[Thunder.]</i> Alas, the storm is come again. My best</p>

<p>way is to creep under his gaberdine. There is no</p>

<p>other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man</p>

<p>with strange bedfellows. I will here shroud till the</p>

<p>dregs of the storm be past.</p>

<p><center><i>[He crawls under Caliban’s cloak.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Stephano singing.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc></p>

<p>     <i>I shall no more to sea, to sea.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Here shall I die ashore–</i></p>

<p>This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral.</p>

<p>Well, here’s my comfort.     <i><i>[Drinks.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[Sings.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,</i></p>

<p>        <i>The gunner and his mate,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,</i></p>

<p>        <i>But none of us cared for Kate.</i></p>

<p>           <i>For she had a tongue with a tang,</i></p>

<p>           <i>Would cry to a sailor “Go hang!”</i></p>

<p>     <i>She loved not the savor of tar nor of pitch,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Yet a tailor might scratch her where’er she did itch.</i></p>

<p>           <i>Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!</i></p>

<p>This is a scurvy tune too. But here’s my comfort.</p>

<p><center><i>[Drinks.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  Do not torment me! O!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  What’s the matter? Have we devils here? Do</p>

<p>you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind?</p>

<p>Ha? I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now</p>

<p>of your four legs, for it hath been said “As proper a</p>

<p>man as ever went on four legs cannot make him</p>

<p>give ground,” and it shall be said so again while</p>

<p>Stephano breathes at’ nostrils.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  The spirit torments me. O!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  This is some monster of the isle with four</p>

<p>legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the</p>

<p>devil should he learn our language? I will give him</p>

<p>some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him</p>

<p>and keep him tame and get to Naples with him,</p>

<p>he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on</p>

<p>neat’s leather.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  Do not torment me, prithee. I’ll bring my</p>

<p>wood home faster.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  He’s in his fit now, and does not talk after</p>

<p>the wisest. He shall taste of my bottle. If he have</p>

<p>never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove</p>

<p>his fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will</p>

<p>not take too much for him. He shall pay for him that</p>

<p>hath him, and that soundly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  Thou dost me yet but little hurt. Thou wilt</p>

<p>anon; I know it by thy trembling. Now Prosper</p>

<p>works upon thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Come on your ways. Open your mouth.</p>

<p>Here is that which will give language to you, cat.</p>

<p>Open your mouth. This will shake your shaking, I</p>

<p>can tell you, and that soundly. <i>[Caliban drinks.]</i> You</p>

<p>cannot tell who’s your friend. Open your chaps</p>

<p>again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  I should know that voice. It should be–but</p>

<p>he is drowned, and these are devils. O, defend me!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Four legs and two voices–a most delicate</p>

<p>monster! His forward voice now is to speak well of</p>

<p>his friend. His backward voice is to utter foul</p>

<p>speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle</p>

<p>will recover him, I will help his ague. Come.</p>

<p><i>[Caliban drinks.]</i> Amen! I will pour some in thy</p>

<p>other mouth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  Stephano!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy,</p>

<p>this is a devil, and no monster! I will leave him; I</p>

<p>have no long spoon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  Stephano! If thou be’st Stephano, touch me</p>

<p>and speak to me, for I am Trinculo–be not</p>

<p>afeard–thy good friend Trinculo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  If thou be’st Trinculo, come forth. I’ll pull</p>

<p>thee by the lesser legs. If any be Trinculo’s legs,</p>

<p>these are they. <i>[He pulls him out from under Caliban’s</p>

<p>cloak.]</i> Thou art very Trinculo indeed. How</p>

<p>cam’st thou to be the siege of this mooncalf? Can</p>

<p>he vent Trinculos?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke.</p>

<p>But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I</p>

<p>hope now thou art not drowned. Is the storm</p>

<p>overblown? I hid me under the dead mooncalf’s</p>

<p>gaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living,</p>

<p>Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scaped!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Prithee, do not turn me about. My stomach</p>

<p>is not constant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  These be fine things, an if they be not</p>

<p>sprites. That’s a brave god and bears celestial liquor.</p>

<p>I will kneel to him.</p>

<p><center><i>[He crawls out from under the cloak.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc> <i>[to Trinculo]</i>  How didst thou scape? How</p>

<p>cam’st thou hither? Swear by this bottle how thou</p>

<p>cam’st hither–I escaped upon a butt of sack, which</p>

<p>the sailors heaved o’erboard–by this bottle, which</p>

<p>I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands,</p>

<p>since I was cast ashore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  I’ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true</p>

<p>subject, for the liquor is not earthly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc> <i>[to Trinculo]</i>  Here. Swear then how thou</p>

<p>escapedst.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  Swum ashore, man, like a duck. I can swim</p>

<p>like a duck, I’ll be sworn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Here, kiss the book.     <i><i>[Trinculo drinks.]</i></i></p>

<p>Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made</p>

<p>like a goose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  O Stephano, hast any more of this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  The whole butt, man. My cellar is in a rock</p>

<p>by th’ seaside, where my wine is hid.–How now,</p>

<p>mooncalf, how does thine ague?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  Hast thou not dropped from heaven?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Out o’ th’ moon, I do assure thee. I was the</p>

<p>man i’ th’ moon when time was.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee.</p>

<p>My mistress showed me thee, and thy dog, and thy</p>

<p>bush.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Come, swear to that. Kiss the book. I will</p>

<p>furnish it anon with new contents. Swear.</p>

<p><center><i>[Caliban drinks.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  By this good light, this is a very shallow</p>

<p>monster. I afeard of him? A very weak monster. The</p>

<p>man i’ th’ moon? A most poor, credulous monster!</p>

<p>–Well drawn, monster, in good sooth!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  I’ll show thee every fertile inch o’ th’ island,</p>

<p>and I will kiss thy foot. I prithee, be my god.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  By this light, a most perfidious and drunken</p>

<p>monster. When ’s god’s asleep, he’ll rob his bottle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  I’ll kiss thy foot. I’ll swear myself thy subject.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Come on, then. Down, and swear.</p>

<p><center><i>[Caliban kneels.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed</p>

<p>monster. A most scurvy monster. I could</p>

<p>find in my heart to beat him–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Come, kiss.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  –but that the poor monster’s in drink. An</p>

<p>abominable monster.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc></p>

<p>I’ll show thee the best springs. I’ll pluck thee berries.</p>

<p>I’ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.</p>

<p>A plague upon the tyrant that I serve.</p>

<p>I’ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,</p>

<p>Thou wondrous man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder</p>

<p>of a poor drunkard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc> <i>[standing]</i></p>

<p>I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow,</p>

<p>And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts,</p>

<p>Show thee a jay’s nest, and instruct thee how</p>

<p>To snare the nimble marmoset. I’ll bring thee</p>

<p>To clustering filberts, and sometimes I’ll get thee</p>

<p>Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  I prithee now, lead the way without any</p>

<p>more talking.–Trinculo, the King and all our</p>

<p>company else being drowned, we will inherit here.</p>

<p>–Here, bear my bottle.–Fellow Trinculo, we’ll</p>

<p>fill him by and by again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc> <i>[sings drunkenly]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Farewell, master, farewell, farewell.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  A howling monster, a drunken monster.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>No more dams I’ll make for fish,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Nor fetch in firing</i></p>

<p>        <i>At requiring,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish.</i></p>

<p>        <i>’Ban, ’ban, Ca-caliban</i></p>

<p>        <i>Has a new master. Get a new man.</i></p>

<p>Freedom, high-day! High-day, freedom! Freedom,</p>

<p>high-day, freedom!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  O brave monster! Lead the way.</p>
