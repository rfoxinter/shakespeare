<p><center><i>[Enter Prospero, Ferdinand, and Miranda.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[to Ferdinand]</i></p>

<p>If I have too austerely punished you,</p>

<p>Your compensation makes amends, for I</p>

<p>Have given you here a third of mine own life,</p>

<p>Or that for which I live; who once again</p>

<p>I tender to thy hand. All thy vexations</p>

<p>Were but my trials of thy love, and thou</p>

<p>Hast strangely stood the test. Here afore heaven</p>

<p>I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,</p>

<p>Do not smile at me that I boast of her,</p>

<p>For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise</p>

<p>And make it halt behind her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc>  I do believe it</p>

<p>Against an oracle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition</p>

<p>Worthily purchased, take my daughter. But</p>

<p>If thou dost break her virgin-knot before</p>

<p>All sanctimonious ceremonies may</p>

<p>With full and holy rite be ministered,</p>

<p>No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall</p>

<p>To make this contract grow; but barren hate,</p>

<p>Sour-eyed disdain, and discord shall bestrew</p>

<p>The union of your bed with weeds so loathly</p>

<p>That you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed,</p>

<p>As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc>  As I hope</p>

<p>For quiet days, fair issue, and long life,</p>

<p>With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den,</p>

<p>The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion</p>

<p>Our worser genius can shall never melt</p>

<p>Mine honor into lust to take away</p>

<p>The edge of that day’s celebration</p>

<p>When I shall think or Phoebus’ steeds are foundered</p>

<p>Or night kept chained below.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Fairly spoke.</p>

<p>Sit then and talk with her. She is thine own.</p>

<p><center><i>[Ferdinand and Miranda move aside.]</i></center></p>

<p>What, Ariel, my industrious servant, Ariel!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ariel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>What would my potent master? Here I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service</p>

<p>Did worthily perform, and I must use you</p>

<p>In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,</p>

<p>O’er whom I give thee power, here to this place.</p>

<p>Incite them to quick motion, for I must</p>

<p>Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple</p>

<p>Some vanity of mine art. It is my promise,</p>

<p>And they expect it from me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Presently?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Ay, with a twink.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Before you can say “Come” and “Go,”</i></p>

<p>     <i>And breathe twice, and cry “So, so,”</i></p>

<p>     <i>Each one, tripping on his toe,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Will be here with mop and mow.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Do you love me, master? No?</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach</p>

<p>Till thou dost hear me call.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Well; I conceive.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[to Ferdinand]</i></p>

<p>Look thou be true; do not give dalliance</p>

<p>Too much the rein. The strongest oaths are straw</p>

<p>To th’ fire i’ th’ blood. Be more abstemious,</p>

<p>Or else goodnight your vow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc>  I warrant you, sir,</p>

<p>The white cold virgin snow upon my heart</p>

<p>Abates the ardor of my liver.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Well.–</p>

<p>Now come, my Ariel. Bring a corollary</p>

<p>Rather than want a spirit. Appear, and pertly.</p>

<p><center><i>[Soft music.]</i></center></p>

<p>No tongue. All eyes. Be silent.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Iris.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iris</sc></p>

<p>Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas</p>

<p>Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas;</p>

<p>Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,</p>

<p>And flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep;</p>

<p>Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,</p>

<p>Which spongy April at thy hest betrims</p>

<p>To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy</p>

<p>broom groves,</p>

<p>Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,</p>

<p>Being lass-lorn; thy poll-clipped vineyard,</p>

<p>And thy sea marge, sterile and rocky hard,</p>

<p>Where thou thyself dost air–the Queen o’ th’ sky,</p>

<p>Whose wat’ry arch and messenger am I,</p>

<p>Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,</p>

<p>Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,</p>

<p>To come and sport. Her peacocks fly amain.</p>

<p>Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ceres.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ceres</sc></p>

<p>Hail, many-colored messenger, that ne’er</p>

<p>Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;</p>

<p>Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers</p>

<p>Diffusest honey drops, refreshing showers;</p>

<p>And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown</p>

<p>My bosky acres and my unshrubbed down,</p>

<p>Rich scarf to my proud Earth. Why hath thy queen</p>

<p>Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iris</sc></p>

<p>A contract of true love to celebrate,</p>

<p>And some donation freely to estate</p>

<p>On the blest lovers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ceres</sc>  Tell me, heavenly bow,</p>

<p>If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,</p>

<p>Do now attend the Queen? Since they did plot</p>

<p>The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,</p>

<p>Her and her blind boy’s scandaled company</p>

<p>I have forsworn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iris</sc>  Of her society</p>

<p>Be not afraid. I met her deity</p>

<p>Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son</p>

<p>Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have</p>

<p>done</p>

<p>Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,</p>

<p>Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid</p>

<p>Till Hymen’s torch be lighted–but in vain.</p>

<p>Mars’s hot minion is returned again;</p>

<p>Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,</p>

<p>Swears he will shoot no more, but play with</p>

<p>sparrows,</p>

<p>And be a boy right out.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Juno descends.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ceres</sc>  Highest queen of state,</p>

<p>Great Juno, comes. I know her by her gait.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juno</sc></p>

<p>How does my bounteous sister? Go with me</p>

<p>To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be</p>

<p>And honored in their issue.</p>

<p><center><i>[They sing.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juno</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Honor, riches, marriage-blessing,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Long continuance and increasing,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Hourly joys be still upon you.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Juno sings her blessings on you.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ceres</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Earth’s increase, foison plenty,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Barns and garners never empty,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Vines with clust’ring bunches growing,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Plants with goodly burden bowing;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Spring come to you at the farthest</i></p>

<p>     <i>In the very end of harvest.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Scarcity and want shall shun you.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Ceres’ blessing so is on you.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc></p>

<p>This is a most majestic vision, and</p>

<p>Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold</p>

<p>To think these spirits?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Spirits, which by mine art</p>

<p>I have from their confines called to enact</p>

<p>My present fancies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc>  Let me live here ever.</p>

<p>So rare a wondered father and a wise</p>

<p>Makes this place paradise.</p>

<p><center><i>[Juno and Ceres whisper,</p>

<p>and send Iris on employment.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Sweet now, silence.</p>

<p>Juno and Ceres whisper seriously.</p>

<p>There’s something else to do. Hush, and be mute,</p>

<p>Or else our spell is marred.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iris</sc></p>

<p>You nymphs, called naiads of the windring brooks,</p>

<p>With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,</p>

<p>Leave your crisp channels and on this green land</p>

<p>Answer your summons, Juno does command.</p>

<p>Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate</p>

<p>A contract of true love. Be not too late.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter certain Nymphs.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>You sunburned sicklemen, of August weary,</p>

<p>Come hither from the furrow and be merry.</p>

<p>Make holiday: your rye-straw hats put on,</p>

<p>And these fresh nymphs encounter every one</p>

<p>In country footing.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter certain Reapers, properly habited. They join with</p>

<p>the Nymphs in a graceful dance, towards the end</p>

<p>whereof Prospero starts suddenly and speaks.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>I had forgot that foul conspiracy</p>

<p>Of the beast Caliban and his confederates</p>

<p>Against my life. The minute of their plot</p>

<p>Is almost come.–Well done. Avoid. No more.</p>

<p><center><i>[To a strange, hollow, and confused noise,</p>

<p>the spirits heavily vanish.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc> <i>[to Miranda]</i></p>

<p>This is strange. Your father’s in some passion</p>

<p>That works him strongly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc>  Never till this day</p>

<p>Saw I him touched with anger, so distempered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[to Ferdinand]</i></p>

<p>You do look, my son, in a moved sort,</p>

<p>As if you were dismayed. Be cheerful, sir.</p>

<p>Our revels now are ended. These our actors,</p>

<p>As I foretold you, were all spirits and</p>

<p>Are melted into air, into thin air;</p>

<p>And like the baseless fabric of this vision,</p>

<p>The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,</p>

<p>The solemn temples, the great globe itself,</p>

<p>Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,</p>

<p>And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,</p>

<p>Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff</p>

<p>As dreams are made on, and our little life</p>

<p>Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexed.</p>

<p>Bear with my weakness. My old brain is troubled.</p>

<p>Be not disturbed with my infirmity.</p>

<p>If you be pleased, retire into my cell</p>

<p>And there repose. A turn or two I’ll walk</p>

<p>To still my beating mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc>/<sc>Miranda</sc>  We wish your peace.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ariel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Come with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel. Come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>Thy thoughts I cleave to. What’s thy pleasure?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Spirit,</p>

<p>We must prepare to meet with Caliban.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>Ay, my commander. When I presented Ceres,</p>

<p>I thought to have told thee of it, but I feared</p>

<p>Lest I might anger thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking,</p>

<p>So full of valor that they smote the air</p>

<p>For breathing in their faces, beat the ground</p>

<p>For kissing of their feet; yet always bending</p>

<p>Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor,</p>

<p>At which, like unbacked colts, they pricked their</p>

<p>ears,</p>

<p>Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses</p>

<p>As they smelt music. So I charmed their ears</p>

<p>That, calf-like, they my lowing followed through</p>

<p>Toothed briers, sharp furzes, pricking gorse, and</p>

<p>thorns,</p>

<p>Which entered their frail shins. At last I left them</p>

<p>I’ th’ filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,</p>

<p>There dancing up to th’ chins, that the foul lake</p>

<p>O’erstunk their feet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  This was well done, my bird.</p>

<p>Thy shape invisible retain thou still.</p>

<p>The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither</p>

<p>For stale to catch these thieves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  I go, I go.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>A devil, a born devil, on whose nature</p>

<p>Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,</p>

<p>Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;</p>

<p>And as with age his body uglier grows,</p>

<p>So his mind cankers. I will plague them all</p>

<p>Even to roaring.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ariel, loaden with glistering apparel, etc.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Come, hang them on this line.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo, all wet, as</p>

<p>Prospero and Ariel look on.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole</p>

<p>may not hear a footfall. We now are near his cell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Monster, your fairy, which you say is a</p>

<p>harmless fairy, has done little better than played the</p>

<p>jack with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  Monster, I do smell all horse piss, at which</p>

<p>my nose is in great indignation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  So is mine.–Do you hear, monster. If I</p>

<p>should take a displeasure against you, look you–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  Thou wert but a lost monster.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc></p>

<p>Good my lord, give me thy favor still.</p>

<p>Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to</p>

<p>Shall hoodwink this mischance. Therefore speak</p>

<p>softly.</p>

<p>All’s hushed as midnight yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  There is not only disgrace and dishonor in</p>

<p>that, monster, but an infinite loss.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  That’s more to me than my wetting. Yet this</p>

<p>is your harmless fairy, monster!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o’er</p>

<p>ears for my labor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc></p>

<p>Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,</p>

<p>This is the mouth o’ th’ cell. No noise, and enter.</p>

<p>Do that good mischief which may make this island</p>

<p>Thine own forever, and I, thy Caliban,</p>

<p>For aye thy foot-licker.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody</p>

<p>thoughts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc> <i>[seeing the apparel]</i>  O King Stephano, O</p>

<p>peer, O worthy Stephano, look what a wardrobe</p>

<p>here is for thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc></p>

<p>Let it alone, thou fool. It is but trash.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  Oho, monster, we know what belongs to a</p>

<p>frippery. <i>[He puts on one of the gowns.]</i> O King</p>

<p>Stephano!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Put off that gown, Trinculo. By this hand,</p>

<p>I’ll have that gown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  Thy Grace shall have it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc></p>

<p>The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean</p>

<p>To dote thus on such luggage? Let ’t alone,</p>

<p>And do the murder first. If he awake,</p>

<p>From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches,</p>

<p>Make us strange stuff.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Be you quiet, monster.–Mistress Line, is</p>

<p>not this my jerkin?     <i><i>[He takes a jacket from the tree.]</i></i></p>

<p>Now is the jerkin under the line.–Now, jerkin, you</p>

<p>are like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  Do, do. We steal by line and level, an ’t like</p>

<p>your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  I thank thee for that jest. Here’s a garment</p>

<p>for ’t. Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king</p>

<p>of this country. “Steal by line and level” is an excellent</p>

<p>pass of pate. There’s another garment for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  Monster, come, put some lime upon your</p>

<p>fingers, and away with the rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc></p>

<p>I will have none on ’t. We shall lose our time</p>

<p>And all be turned to barnacles or to apes</p>

<p>With foreheads villainous low.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Monster, lay to your fingers. Help to bear</p>

<p>this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn</p>

<p>you out of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  And this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Ay, and this.</p>

<p><center><i>[A noise of hunters heard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter divers spirits in shape of dogs and hounds,</p>

<p>hunting them about, Prospero and Ariel setting them on.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Hey, Mountain, hey!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Silver! There it goes, Silver!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Fury, Fury! There, Tyrant, there! Hark, hark!</p>

<p><center><i>[Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo are driven off.]</i></center></p>

<p>Go, charge my goblins that they grind their joints</p>

<p>With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews</p>

<p>With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make</p>

<p>them</p>

<p>Than pard or cat o’ mountain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Hark, they roar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour</p>

<p>Lies at my mercy all mine enemies.</p>

<p>Shortly shall all my labors end, and thou</p>

<p>Shalt have the air at freedom. For a little</p>

<p>Follow and do me service.</p>
