<p><center><i>[Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian,</p>

<p>Francisco, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span> <i>[to Alonso]</i></p>

<p>Beseech you, sir, be merry. You have cause–</p>

<p>So have we all–of joy, for our escape</p>

<p>Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe</p>

<p>Is common; every day some sailor’s wife,</p>

<p>The masters of some merchant, and the merchant</p>

<p>Have just our theme of woe. But for the miracle–</p>

<p>I mean our preservation–few in millions</p>

<p>Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh</p>

<p>Our sorrow with our comfort.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span>  Prithee, peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span> <i>[aside to Antonio]</i>  He receives comfort like</p>

<p>cold porridge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  The visitor will not give him o’er so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit.</p>

<p>By and by it will strike.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span> <i>[to Alonso]</i>  Sir–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  One. Tell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  When every grief is entertained that’s offered,</p>

<p>comes to th’ entertainer–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  A dollar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  Dolor comes to him indeed. You have spoken</p>

<p>truer than you purposed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  You have taken it wiselier than I meant you</p>

<p>should.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span> <i>[to Alonso]</i>  Therefore, my lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span> <i>[to Gonzalo]</i>  I prithee, spare.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  Well, I have done. But yet–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span> <i>[aside to Antonio]</i>  He will be talking.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span> <i>[aside to Sebastian]</i>  Which, of he or Adrian,</p>

<p>for a good wager, first begins to crow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  The old cock.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  The cockerel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Done. The wager?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  A laughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  A match!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adrian</span>  Though this island seem to be desert–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Ha, ha, ha.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  So. You’re paid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adrian</span>  Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Yet–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adrian</span>  Yet–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  He could not miss ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adrian</span>  It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate</p>

<p>temperance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Temperance was a delicate wench.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly</p>

<p>delivered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adrian</span>  The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  Here is everything advantageous to life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  True, save means to live.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Of that there’s none, or little.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  How lush and lusty the grass looks! How</p>

<p>green!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  The ground indeed is tawny.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  With an eye of green in ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  He misses not much.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost</p>

<p>beyond credit–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  As many vouched rarities are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  That our garments, being, as they were,</p>

<p>drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their</p>

<p>freshness and gloss, being rather new-dyed than</p>

<p>stained with salt water.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  If but one of his pockets could speak, would</p>

<p>it not say he lies?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  Methinks our garments are now as fresh as</p>

<p>when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage</p>

<p>of the King’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of</p>

<p>Tunis.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  ’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper</p>

<p>well in our return.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adrian</span>  Tunis was never graced before with such a</p>

<p>paragon to their queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  Not since widow Dido’s time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Widow? A pox o’ that! How came that “widow”</p>

<p>in? Widow Dido!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  What if he had said “widower Aeneas” too?</p>

<p>Good Lord, how you take it!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adrian</span> <i>[to Gonzalo]</i>  “Widow Dido,” said you? You</p>

<p>make me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of</p>

<p>Tunis.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adrian</span>  Carthage?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  I assure you, Carthage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  His word is more than the miraculous harp.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  He hath raised the wall, and houses too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  What impossible matter will he make easy</p>

<p>next?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  I think he will carry this island home in his</p>

<p>pocket and give it his son for an apple.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring</p>

<p>forth more islands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  Ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Why, in good time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span> <i>[to Alonso]</i>  Sir, we were talking that our</p>

<p>garments seem now as fresh as when we were at</p>

<p>Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now</p>

<p>queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  And the rarest that e’er came there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  O, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span> <i>[to Alonso]</i>  Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as</p>

<p>the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  That “sort” was well fished for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span> <i>[to Alonso]</i>  When I wore it at your daughter’s</p>

<p>marriage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span></p>

<p>You cram these words into mine ears against</p>

<p>The stomach of my sense. Would I had never</p>

<p>Married my daughter there, for coming thence</p>

<p>My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too,</p>

<p>Who is so far from Italy removed</p>

<p>I ne’er again shall see her.–O, thou mine heir</p>

<p>Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish</p>

<p>Hath made his meal on thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Francisco</span>  Sir, he may live.</p>

<p>I saw him beat the surges under him</p>

<p>And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,</p>

<p>Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted</p>

<p>The surge most swoll’n that met him. His bold head</p>

<p>’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared</p>

<p>Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke</p>

<p>To th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,</p>

<p>As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt</p>

<p>He came alive to land.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span>  No, no, he’s gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span></p>

<p>Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,</p>

<p>That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,</p>

<p>But rather lose her to an African,</p>

<p>Where she at least is banished from your eye,</p>

<p>Who hath cause to wet the grief on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span>  Prithee, peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span></p>

<p>You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise</p>

<p>By all of us; and the fair soul herself</p>

<p>Weighed between loathness and obedience at</p>

<p>Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost</p>

<p>your son,</p>

<p>I fear, forever. Milan and Naples have</p>

<p>More widows in them of this business’ making</p>

<p>Than we bring men to comfort them.</p>

<p>The fault’s your own.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span>  So is the dear’st o’ th’ loss.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  My lord Sebastian,</p>

<p>The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness</p>

<p>And time to speak it in. You rub the sore</p>

<p>When you should bring the plaster.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Very well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  And most chirurgeonly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span> <i>[to Alonso]</i></p>

<p>It is foul weather in us all, good sir,</p>

<p>When you are cloudy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Foul weather?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Very foul.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span></p>

<p>Had I plantation of this isle, my lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>He’d sow ’t with nettle seed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Or docks, or mallows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span></p>

<p>And were the king on ’t, what would I do?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Scape being drunk, for want of wine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span></p>

<p>I’ th’ commonwealth I would by contraries</p>

<p>Execute all things, for no kind of traffic</p>

<p>Would I admit; no name of magistrate;</p>

<p>Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,</p>

<p>And use of service, none; contract, succession,</p>

<p>Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;</p>

<p>No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;</p>

<p>No occupation; all men idle, all,</p>

<p>And women too, but innocent and pure;</p>

<p>No sovereignty–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Yet he would be king on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  The latter end of his commonwealth forgets</p>

<p>the beginning.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span></p>

<p>All things in common nature should produce</p>

<p>Without sweat or endeavor; treason, felony,</p>

<p>Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine</p>

<p>Would I not have; but nature should bring forth</p>

<p>Of its own kind all foison, all abundance,</p>

<p>To feed my innocent people.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  No marrying ’mong his subjects?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  None, man, all idle: whores and knaves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span></p>

<p>I would with such perfection govern, sir,</p>

<p>T’ excel the Golden Age.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  ’Save his Majesty!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>Long live Gonzalo!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  And do you mark me, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span></p>

<p>Prithee, no more. Thou dost talk nothing to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  I do well believe your Highness, and did it to</p>

<p>minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of</p>

<p>such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use</p>

<p>to laugh at nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  ’Twas you we laughed at.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  Who in this kind of merry fooling am</p>

<p>nothing to you. So you may continue, and laugh at</p>

<p>nothing still.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  What a blow was there given!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  An it had not fallen flatlong.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  You are gentlemen of brave mettle. You</p>

<p>would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would</p>

<p>continue in it five weeks without changing.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ariel invisible, playing solemn music.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  We would so, and then go a-batfowling.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span> <i>[to Gonzalo]</i>  Nay, good my lord, be not angry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  No, I warrant you, I will not adventure my</p>

<p>discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep?</p>

<p>For I am very heavy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Go sleep, and hear us.</p>

<p><center><i>[All sink down asleep except Alonso,</p>

<p>Antonio, and Sebastian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span></p>

<p>What, all so soon asleep? I wish mine eyes</p>

<p>Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts. I find</p>

<p>They are inclined to do so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Please you, sir,</p>

<p>Do not omit the heavy offer of it.</p>

<p>It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,</p>

<p>It is a comforter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  We two, my lord,</p>

<p>Will guard your person while you take your rest,</p>

<p>And watch your safety.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span>  Thank you. Wondrous heavy.</p>

<p><center><i>[Alonso sleeps. Ariel exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span></p>

<p>What a strange drowsiness possesses them!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>It is the quality o’ th’ climate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Why</p>

<p>Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find</p>

<p>Not myself disposed to sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Nor I. My spirits are nimble.</p>

<p>They fell together all, as by consent.</p>

<p>They dropped as by a thunderstroke. What might,</p>

<p>Worthy Sebastian, O, what might–? No more.</p>

<p>And yet methinks I see it in thy face</p>

<p>What thou shouldst be. Th’ occasion speaks thee, and</p>

<p>My strong imagination sees a crown</p>

<p>Dropping upon thy head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  What, art thou waking?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>Do you not hear me speak?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  I do, and surely</p>

<p>It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st</p>

<p>Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?</p>

<p>This is a strange repose, to be asleep</p>

<p>With eyes wide open–standing, speaking, moving–</p>

<p>And yet so fast asleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Noble Sebastian,</p>

<p>Thou let’st thy fortune sleep, die rather, wink’st</p>

<p>Whiles thou art waking.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Thou dost snore distinctly.</p>

<p>There’s meaning in thy snores.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>I am more serious than my custom. You</p>

<p>Must be so too, if heed me; which to do</p>

<p>Trebles thee o’er.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Well, I am standing water.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>I’ll teach you how to flow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Do so. To ebb</p>

<p>Hereditary sloth instructs me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  O,</p>

<p>If you but knew how you the purpose cherish</p>

<p>Whiles thus you mock it, how in stripping it</p>

<p>You more invest it. Ebbing men indeed</p>

<p>Most often do so near the bottom run</p>

<p>By their own fear or sloth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Prithee, say on.</p>

<p>The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim</p>

<p>A matter from thee, and a birth indeed</p>

<p>Which throes thee much to yield.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Thus, sir:</p>

<p>Although this lord of weak remembrance–this,</p>

<p>Who shall be of as little memory</p>

<p>When he is earthed–hath here almost persuaded–</p>

<p>For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only</p>

<p>Professes to persuade–the King his son’s alive,</p>

<p>’Tis as impossible that he’s undrowned</p>

<p>As he that sleeps here swims.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  I have no hope</p>

<p>That he’s undrowned.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  O, out of that no hope</p>

<p>What great hope have you! No hope that way is</p>

<p>Another way so high a hope that even</p>

<p>Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,</p>

<p>But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me</p>

<p>That Ferdinand is drowned?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  He’s gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Then tell me,</p>

<p>Who’s the next heir of Naples?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Claribel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells</p>

<p>Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples</p>

<p>Can have no note, unless the sun were post–</p>

<p>The man i’ th’ moon’s too slow–till newborn chins</p>

<p>Be rough and razorable; she that from whom</p>

<p>We all were sea-swallowed, though some cast again,</p>

<p>And by that destiny to perform an act</p>

<p>Whereof what’s past is prologue, what to come</p>

<p>In yours and my discharge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  What stuff is this? How say you?</p>

<p>’Tis true my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis,</p>

<p>So is she heir of Naples, ’twixt which regions</p>

<p>There is some space.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  A space whose ev’ry cubit</p>

<p>Seems to cry out “How shall that Claribel</p>

<p>Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis</p>

<p>And let Sebastian wake.” Say this were death</p>

<p>That now hath seized them, why, they were no worse</p>

<p>Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples</p>

<p>As well as he that sleeps, lords that can prate</p>

<p>As amply and unnecessarily</p>

<p>As this Gonzalo. I myself could make</p>

<p>A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore</p>

<p>The mind that I do, what a sleep were this</p>

<p>For your advancement! Do you understand me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span></p>

<p>Methinks I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  And how does your content</p>

<p>Tender your own good fortune?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  I remember</p>

<p>You did supplant your brother Prospero.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  True,</p>

<p>And look how well my garments sit upon me,</p>

<p>Much feater than before. My brother’s servants</p>

<p>Were then my fellows; now they are my men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  But, for your conscience?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>Ay, sir, where lies that? If ’twere a kibe,</p>

<p>’Twould put me to my slipper, but I feel not</p>

<p>This deity in my bosom. Twenty consciences</p>

<p>That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they</p>

<p>And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,</p>

<p>No better than the earth he lies upon.</p>

<p>If he were that which now he’s like–that’s dead–</p>

<p>Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,</p>

<p>Can lay to bed forever; whiles you, doing thus,</p>

<p>To the perpetual wink for aye might put</p>

<p>This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who</p>

<p>Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,</p>

<p>They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.</p>

<p>They’ll tell the clock to any business that</p>

<p>We say befits the hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  Thy case, dear friend,</p>

<p>Shall be my precedent: as thou got’st Milan,</p>

<p>I’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword. One stroke</p>

<p>Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,</p>

<p>And I the King shall love thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Draw together,</p>

<p>And when I rear my hand, do you the like</p>

<p>To fall it on Gonzalo.     <i><i>[They draw their swords.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span>  O, but one word.</p>

<p><center><i>[They talk apart.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ariel, invisible, with music and song.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ariel</span> <i>[to the sleeping Gonzalo]</i></p>

<p>My master through his art foresees the danger</p>

<p>That you, his friend, are in, and sends me forth–</p>

<p>For else his project dies–to keep them living.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sings in Gonzalo’s ear:]</i></center></p>

<p>     <i>While you here do snoring lie,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Open-eyed conspiracy</i></p>

<p>        <i>His time doth take.</i></p>

<p>     <i>If of life you keep a care,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Shake off slumber and beware.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Awake, awake!</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span> <i>[to Sebastian]</i>  Then let us both be sudden.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span> <i>[waking]</i>  Now, good angels preserve the</p>

<p>King!     <i><i>[He wakes Alonso.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span> <i>[to Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>Why, how now, ho! Awake? Why are you drawn?</p>

<p>Wherefore this ghastly looking?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span> <i>[to Sebastian]</i>  What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span></p>

<p>Whiles we stood here securing your repose,</p>

<p>Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing</p>

<p>Like bulls, or rather lions. Did ’t not wake you?</p>

<p>It struck mine ear most terribly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span>  I heard nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>O, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear,</p>

<p>To make an earthquake. Sure, it was the roar</p>

<p>Of a whole herd of lions.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span>  Heard you this, Gonzalo?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span></p>

<p>Upon mine honor, sir, I heard a humming,</p>

<p>And that a strange one too, which did awake me.</p>

<p>I shaked you, sir, and cried. As mine eyes opened,</p>

<p>I saw their weapons drawn. There was a noise,</p>

<p>That’s verily. ’Tis best we stand upon our guard,</p>

<p>Or that we quit this place. Let’s draw our weapons.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span></p>

<p>Lead off this ground, and let’s make further search</p>

<p>For my poor son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gonzalo</span>  Heavens keep him from these beasts,</p>

<p>For he is, sure, i’ th’ island.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alonso</span>  Lead away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ariel</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Prospero my lord shall know what I have done.</p>

<p>So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.</p>
