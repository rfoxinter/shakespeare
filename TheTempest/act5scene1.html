<p><center><i>[Enter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Now does my project gather to a head.</p>

<p>My charms crack not, my spirits obey, and time</p>

<p>Goes upright with his carriage.–How’s the day?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord,</p>

<p>You said our work should cease.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  I did say so</p>

<p>When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,</p>

<p>How fares the King and ’s followers?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  Confined</p>

<p>together</p>

<p>In the same fashion as you gave in charge,</p>

<p>Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,</p>

<p>In the line grove which weather-fends your cell.</p>

<p>They cannot budge till your release. The King,</p>

<p>His brother, and yours abide all three distracted,</p>

<p>And the remainder mourning over them,</p>

<p>Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly</p>

<p>Him that you termed, sir, the good old Lord</p>

<p>Gonzalo.</p>

<p>His tears runs down his beard like winter’s drops</p>

<p>From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works</p>

<p>’em</p>

<p>That if you now beheld them, your affections</p>

<p>Would become tender.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Dost thou think so, spirit?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>Mine would, sir, were I human.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  And mine shall.</p>

<p>Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling</p>

<p>Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,</p>

<p>One of their kind, that relish all as sharply</p>

<p>Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?</p>

<p>Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th’</p>

<p>quick,</p>

<p>Yet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury</p>

<p>Do I take part. The rarer action is</p>

<p>In virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent,</p>

<p>The sole drift of my purpose doth extend</p>

<p>Not a frown further. Go, release them, Ariel.</p>

<p>My charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore,</p>

<p>And they shall be themselves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc>  I’ll fetch them, sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Prospero draws a large circle on the stage with his staff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>You elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves,</p>

<p>And you that on the sands with printless foot</p>

<p>Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him</p>

<p>When he comes back; you demi-puppets that</p>

<p>By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,</p>

<p>Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime</p>

<p>Is to make midnight mushrumps, that rejoice</p>

<p>To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,</p>

<p>Weak masters though you be, I have bedimmed</p>

<p>The noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds,</p>

<p>And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault</p>

<p>Set roaring war; to the dread rattling thunder</p>

<p>Have I given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak</p>

<p>With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory</p>

<p>Have I made shake, and by the spurs plucked up</p>

<p>The pine and cedar; graves at my command</p>

<p>Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let ’em forth</p>

<p>By my so potent art. But this rough magic</p>

<p>I here abjure, and when I have required</p>

<p>Some heavenly music, which even now I do,</p>

<p><center><i>[Prospero gestures with his staff.]</i></center></p>

<p>To work mine end upon their senses that</p>

<p>This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff,</p>

<p>Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,</p>

<p>And deeper than did ever plummet sound</p>

<p>I’ll drown my book.     <i><i>[Solemn music.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Here enters Ariel before; then Alonso with a frantic</p>

<p>gesture, attended by Gonzalo; Sebastian and Antonio in</p>

<p>like manner attended by Adrian and Francisco. They all</p>

<p>enter the circle which Prospero had made, and there</p>

<p>stand charmed; which Prospero observing, speaks.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>A solemn air, and the best comforter</p>

<p>To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,</p>

<p>Now useless, boiled within thy skull. There stand,</p>

<p>For you are spell-stopped.–</p>

<p>Holy Gonzalo, honorable man,</p>

<p>Mine eyes, e’en sociable to the show of thine,</p>

<p>Fall fellowly drops.–The charm dissolves apace,</p>

<p>And as the morning steals upon the night,</p>

<p>Melting the darkness, so their rising senses</p>

<p>Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle</p>

<p>Their clearer reason.–O good Gonzalo,</p>

<p>My true preserver and a loyal sir</p>

<p>To him thou follow’st, I will pay thy graces</p>

<p>Home, both in word and deed.–Most cruelly</p>

<p>Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter.</p>

<p>Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.–</p>

<p>Thou art pinched for ’t now, Sebastian.–Flesh and</p>

<p>blood,</p>

<p>You, brother mine, that entertained ambition,</p>

<p>Expelled remorse and nature, whom, with Sebastian,</p>

<p>Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,</p>

<p>Would here have killed your king, I do forgive thee,</p>

<p>Unnatural though thou art.–Their understanding</p>

<p>Begins to swell, and the approaching tide</p>

<p>Will shortly fill the reasonable shore</p>

<p>That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them</p>

<p>That yet looks on me or would know me.–Ariel,</p>

<p>Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell.</p>

<p><center><i>[Ariel exits and at once returns</p>

<p>with Prospero’s ducal robes.]</i></center></p>

<p>I will discase me and myself present</p>

<p>As I was sometime Milan.–Quickly, spirit,</p>

<p>Thou shalt ere long be free.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc> <i>[sings, and helps to attire him.]</i></p>

<br/>

<p>        <i>Where the bee sucks, there suck I.</i></p>

<p>        <i>In a cowslip’s bell I lie.</i></p>

<p>        <i>There I couch when owls do cry.</i></p>

<p>        <i>On the bat’s back I do fly</i></p>

<p>        <i>After summer merrily.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Merrily, merrily shall I live now</i></p>

<p>     <i>Under the blossom that hangs on the bow.</i></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Why, that’s my dainty Ariel. I shall miss</p>

<p>Thee, but yet thou shalt have freedom. So, so, so.</p>

<p>To the King’s ship, invisible as thou art.</p>

<p>There shalt thou find the mariners asleep</p>

<p>Under the hatches. The master and the boatswain</p>

<p>Being awake, enforce them to this place,</p>

<p>And presently, I prithee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc></p>

<p>I drink the air before me, and return</p>

<p>Or ere your pulse twice beat.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gonzalo</sc></p>

<p>All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement</p>

<p>Inhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us</p>

<p>Out of this fearful country!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[to Alonso]</i>  Behold, sir king,</p>

<p>The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.</p>

<p>For more assurance that a living prince</p>

<p>Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body,</p>

<p><center><i>[He embraces Alonso.]</i></center></p>

<p>And to thee and thy company I bid</p>

<p>A hearty welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  Whe’er thou be’st he or no,</p>

<p>Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me</p>

<p>(As late I have been) I not know. Thy pulse</p>

<p>Beats as of flesh and blood; and since I saw thee,</p>

<p>Th’ affliction of my mind amends, with which</p>

<p>I fear a madness held me. This must crave,</p>

<p>An if this be at all, a most strange story.</p>

<p>Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat</p>

<p>Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should</p>

<p>Prospero</p>

<p>Be living and be here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[to Gonzalo]</i>  First, noble friend,</p>

<p>Let me embrace thine age, whose honor cannot</p>

<p>Be measured or confined.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gonzalo</sc>  Whether this be</p>

<p>Or be not, I’ll not swear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  You do yet taste</p>

<p>Some subtleties o’ th’ isle, that will not let you</p>

<p>Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all.</p>

<p><i>[Aside to Sebastian and Antonio.]</i> But you, my brace</p>

<p>of lords, were I so minded,</p>

<p>I here could pluck his Highness’ frown upon you</p>

<p>And justify you traitors. At this time</p>

<p>I will tell no tales.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  The devil speaks in him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[aside to Sebastian]</i>  No.</p>

<p><i>[To Antonio.]</i> For you, most wicked sir, whom to</p>

<p>call brother</p>

<p>Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive</p>

<p>Thy rankest fault, all of them, and require</p>

<p>My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know</p>

<p>Thou must restore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  If thou be’st Prospero,</p>

<p>Give us particulars of thy preservation,</p>

<p>How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since</p>

<p>Were wracked upon this shore, where I have lost–</p>

<p>How sharp the point of this remembrance is!–</p>

<p>My dear son Ferdinand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  I am woe for ’t, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc></p>

<p>Irreparable is the loss, and patience</p>

<p>Says it is past her cure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  I rather think</p>

<p>You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace,</p>

<p>For the like loss, I have her sovereign aid</p>

<p>And rest myself content.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  You the like loss?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>As great to me as late, and supportable</p>

<p>To make the dear loss have I means much weaker</p>

<p>Than you may call to comfort you, for I</p>

<p>Have lost my daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  A daughter?</p>

<p>O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,</p>

<p>The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish</p>

<p>Myself were mudded in that oozy bed</p>

<p>Where my son lies!–When did you lose your</p>

<p>daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>In this last tempest. I perceive these lords</p>

<p>At this encounter do so much admire</p>

<p>That they devour their reason, and scarce think</p>

<p>Their eyes do offices of truth, their words</p>

<p>Are natural breath.–But howsoe’er you have</p>

<p>Been justled from your senses, know for certain</p>

<p>That I am Prospero and that very duke</p>

<p>Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most</p>

<p>strangely</p>

<p>Upon this shore, where you were wracked, was</p>

<p>landed</p>

<p>To be the lord on ’t. No more yet of this.</p>

<p>For ’tis a chronicle of day by day,</p>

<p>Not a relation for a breakfast, nor</p>

<p>Befitting this first meeting. <i>[To Alonso.]</i> Welcome, sir.</p>

<p>This cell’s my court. Here have I few attendants,</p>

<p>And subjects none abroad. Pray you, look in.</p>

<p>My dukedom since you have given me again,</p>

<p>I will requite you with as good a thing,</p>

<p>At least bring forth a wonder to content you</p>

<p>As much as me my dukedom.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here Prospero discovers Ferdinand and Miranda,</p>

<p>playing at chess.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc> <i>[to Ferdinand]</i></p>

<p>Sweet lord, you play me false.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc>  No, my dearest love,</p>

<p>I would not for the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc></p>

<p>Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,</p>

<p>And I would call it fair play.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  If this prove</p>

<p>A vision of the island, one dear son</p>

<p>Shall I twice lose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  A most high miracle!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc> <i>[seeing Alonso and coming forward]</i></p>

<p>Though the seas threaten, they are merciful.</p>

<p>I have cursed them without cause.     <i><i>[He kneels.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  Now, all the</p>

<p>blessings</p>

<p>Of a glad father compass thee about!</p>

<p>Arise, and say how thou cam’st here.</p>

<p><center><i>[Ferdinand stands.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Miranda</sc> <i>[rising and coming forward]</i>  O wonder!</p>

<p>How many goodly creatures are there here!</p>

<p>How beauteous mankind is! O, brave new world</p>

<p>That has such people in ’t!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  ’Tis new to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc> <i>[to Ferdinand]</i></p>

<p>What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?</p>

<p>Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours.</p>

<p>Is she the goddess that hath severed us</p>

<p>And brought us thus together?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ferdinand</sc>  Sir, she is mortal,</p>

<p>But by immortal providence she’s mine.</p>

<p>I chose her when I could not ask my father</p>

<p>For his advice, nor thought I had one. She</p>

<p>Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,</p>

<p>Of whom so often I have heard renown,</p>

<p>But never saw before, of whom I have</p>

<p>Received a second life; and second father</p>

<p>This lady makes him to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  I am hers.</p>

<p>But, O, how oddly will it sound that I</p>

<p>Must ask my child forgiveness!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  There, sir, stop.</p>

<p>Let us not burden our remembrances with</p>

<p>A heaviness that’s gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gonzalo</sc>  I have inly wept</p>

<p>Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you</p>

<p>gods,</p>

<p>And on this couple drop a blessed crown,</p>

<p>For it is you that have chalked forth the way</p>

<p>Which brought us hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  I say “Amen,” Gonzalo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gonzalo</sc></p>

<p>Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue</p>

<p>Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice</p>

<p>Beyond a common joy, and set it down</p>

<p>With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage</p>

<p>Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,</p>

<p>And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife</p>

<p>Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom</p>

<p>In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves</p>

<p>When no man was his own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc> <i>[to Ferdinand and Miranda]</i>  Give me your</p>

<p>hands.</p>

<p>Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart</p>

<p>That doth not wish you joy!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gonzalo</sc>  Be it so. Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ariel, with the Master and Boatswain</p>

<p>amazedly following.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O, look, sir, look, sir, here is more of us.</p>

<p>I prophesied if a gallows were on land,</p>

<p>This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,</p>

<p>That swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on</p>

<p>shore?</p>

<p>Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boatswain</sc></p>

<p>The best news is that we have safely found</p>

<p>Our king and company. The next: our ship,</p>

<p>Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split,</p>

<p>Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when</p>

<p>We first put out to sea.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc> <i>[aside to Prospero]</i>  Sir, all this service</p>

<p>Have I done since I went.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[aside to Ariel]</i>  My tricksy spirit!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc></p>

<p>These are not natural events. They strengthen</p>

<p>From strange to stranger.–Say, how came you</p>

<p>hither?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boatswain</sc></p>

<p>If I did think, sir, I were well awake,</p>

<p>I’d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep</p>

<p>And–how, we know not–all clapped under</p>

<p>hatches,</p>

<p>Where, but even now, with strange and several</p>

<p>noises</p>

<p>Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,</p>

<p>And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,</p>

<p>We were awaked, straightway at liberty,</p>

<p>Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld</p>

<p>Our royal, good, and gallant ship, our master</p>

<p>Cap’ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,</p>

<p>Even in a dream were we divided from them</p>

<p>And were brought moping hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ariel</sc> <i>[aside to Prospero]</i>  Was ’t well done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc> <i>[aside to Ariel]</i></p>

<p>Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc></p>

<p>This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod,</p>

<p>And there is in this business more than nature</p>

<p>Was ever conduct of. Some oracle</p>

<p>Must rectify our knowledge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Sir, my liege,</p>

<p>Do not infest your mind with beating on</p>

<p>The strangeness of this business. At picked leisure,</p>

<p>Which shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you,</p>

<p>Which to you shall seem probable, of every</p>

<p>These happened accidents; till when, be cheerful</p>

<p>And think of each thing well. <i>[Aside to Ariel.]</i></p>

<p>Come hither, spirit;</p>

<p>Set Caliban and his companions free.</p>

<p>Untie the spell. <i>[Ariel exits.]</i> How fares my gracious</p>

<p>sir?</p>

<p>There are yet missing of your company</p>

<p>Some few odd lads that you remember not.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ariel, driving in Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo</p>

<p>in their stolen apparel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  Every man shift for all the rest, and let no</p>

<p>man take care for himself, for all is but fortune.</p>

<p>Coraggio, bully monster, coraggio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  If these be true spies which I wear in my</p>

<p>head, here’s a goodly sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How</p>

<p>fine my master is! I am afraid he will chastise me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  Ha, ha!</p>

<p>What things are these, my Lord Antonio?</p>

<p>Will money buy ’em?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  Very like. One of them</p>

<p>Is a plain fish and no doubt marketable.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,</p>

<p>Then say if they be true. This misshapen knave,</p>

<p>His mother was a witch, and one so strong</p>

<p>That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,</p>

<p>And deal in her command without her power.</p>

<p>These three have robbed me, and this demi-devil,</p>

<p>For he’s a bastard one, had plotted with them</p>

<p>To take my life. Two of these fellows you</p>

<p>Must know and own. This thing of darkness I</p>

<p>Acknowledge mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc>  I shall be pinched to death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc></p>

<p>Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  He is drunk now. Where had he wine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc></p>

<p>And Trinculo is reeling ripe. Where should they</p>

<p>Find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em?</p>

<p><i>[To Trinculo.]</i> How cam’st thou in this pickle?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trinculo</sc>  I have been in such a pickle since I saw you</p>

<p>last that I fear me will never out of my bones. I</p>

<p>shall not fear flyblowing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  Why, how now, Stephano?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  O, touch me not! I am not Stephano, but a</p>

<p>cramp.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  You’d be king o’ the isle, sirrah?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stephano</sc>  I should have been a sore one, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc> <i>[indicating Caliban]</i></p>

<p>This is as strange a thing as e’er I looked on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>He is as disproportioned in his manners</p>

<p>As in his shape. <i>[To Caliban.]</i> Go, sirrah, to my cell.</p>

<p>Take with you your companions. As you look</p>

<p>To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caliban</sc></p>

<p>Ay, that I will, and I’ll be wise hereafter</p>

<p>And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass</p>

<p>Was I to take this drunkard for a god,</p>

<p>And worship this dull fool!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  Go to, away!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc> <i>[to Stephano and Trinculo]</i></p>

<p>Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  Or stole it, rather.</p>

<p><center><i>[Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc></p>

<p>Sir, I invite your Highness and your train</p>

<p>To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest</p>

<p>For this one night, which part of it I’ll waste</p>

<p>With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it</p>

<p>Go quick away: the story of my life</p>

<p>And the particular accidents gone by</p>

<p>Since I came to this isle. And in the morn</p>

<p>I’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,</p>

<p>Where I have hope to see the nuptial</p>

<p>Of these our dear-beloved solemnized,</p>

<p>And thence retire me to my Milan, where</p>

<p>Every third thought shall be my grave.</p>

<p><sc>Alonso</sc>  I long</p>

<p>To hear the story of your life, which must</p>

<p>Take the ear strangely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prospero</sc>  I’ll deliver all,</p>

<p>And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,</p>

<p>And sail so expeditious that shall catch</p>

<p>Your royal fleet far off. <i>[Aside to Ariel.]</i> My Ariel,</p>

<p>chick,</p>

<p>That is thy charge. Then to the elements</p>

<p>Be free, and fare thou well.–Please you, draw near.</p>
