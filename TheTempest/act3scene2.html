<p><center><i>[Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span> <i>[to Trinculo]</i>  Tell not me. When the butt is</p>

<p>out, we will drink water; not a drop before. Therefore</p>

<p>bear up and board ’em.–Servant monster,</p>

<p>drink to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  Servant monster? The folly of this island!</p>

<p>They say there’s but five upon this isle; we are three</p>

<p>of them. If th’ other two be brained like us, the state</p>

<p>totters.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Drink, servant monster, when I bid thee.</p>

<p>Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.</p>

<p><center><i>[Caliban drinks.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  Where should they be set else? He were a</p>

<p>brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  My man-monster hath drowned his tongue</p>

<p>in sack. For my part, the sea cannot drown me. I</p>

<p>swam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty</p>

<p>leagues off and on, by this light.–Thou shalt be my</p>

<p>lieutenant, monster, or my standard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  Your lieutenant, if you list. He’s no</p>

<p>standard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  We’ll not run, Monsieur Monster.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  Nor go neither. But you’ll lie like dogs, and</p>

<p>yet say nothing neither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Mooncalf, speak once in thy life, if thou</p>

<p>be’st a good mooncalf.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span>  How does thy Honor? Let me lick thy shoe. I’ll</p>

<p>not serve him; he is not valiant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  Thou liest, most ignorant monster. I am in</p>

<p>case to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched</p>

<p>fish, thou! Was there ever man a coward that hath</p>

<p>drunk so much sack as I today? Wilt thou tell a</p>

<p>monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a</p>

<p>monster?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span>  Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my</p>

<p>lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  “Lord,” quoth he? That a monster should be</p>

<p>such a natural!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span>  Lo, lo again! Bite him to death, I prithee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head.</p>

<p>If you prove a mutineer, the next tree. The poor</p>

<p>monster’s my subject, and he shall not suffer</p>

<p>indignity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span>  I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased</p>

<p>to harken once again to the suit I made to thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Marry, will I. Kneel and repeat it. I will</p>

<p>stand, and so shall Trinculo.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ariel, invisible.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span> <i>[kneeling]</i>  As I told thee before, I am subject</p>

<p>to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath</p>

<p>cheated me of the island.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ariel</span> <i>[in Trinculo’s voice]</i>  Thou liest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span> <i>[to Trinculo]</i>  Thou liest, thou jesting monkey,</p>

<p>thou. <i>[He stands.]</i> I would my valiant master would</p>

<p>destroy thee. I do not lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in ’s</p>

<p>tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your</p>

<p>teeth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  Why, I said nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Mum then, and no more. <i>[Trinculo stands</p>

<p>aside.]</i> Proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span></p>

<p>I say by sorcery he got this isle;</p>

<p>From me he got it. If thy Greatness will,</p>

<p>Revenge it on him, for I know thou dar’st,</p>

<p>But this thing dare not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  That’s most certain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span></p>

<p>Thou shalt be lord of it, and I’ll serve thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  How now shall this be compassed? Canst</p>

<p>thou bring me to the party?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span></p>

<p>Yea, yea, my lord. I’ll yield him thee asleep,</p>

<p>Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ariel</span> <i>[in Trinculo’s voice]</i>  Thou liest. Thou canst not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span></p>

<p>What a pied ninny’s this!–Thou scurvy patch!–</p>

<p>I do beseech thy Greatness, give him blows</p>

<p>And take his bottle from him. When that’s gone,</p>

<p>He shall drink naught but brine, for I’ll not show him</p>

<p>Where the quick freshes are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Trinculo, run into no further danger. Interrupt</p>

<p>the monster one word further, and by this</p>

<p>hand, I’ll turn my mercy out o’ doors and make a</p>

<p>stockfish of thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  Why, what did I? I did nothing. I’ll go</p>

<p>farther off.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Didst thou not say he lied?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ariel</span> <i>[in Trinculo’s voice]</i>  Thou liest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Do I so? Take thou that.     <i><i>[He beats Trinculo.]</i></i></p>

<p>As you like this, give me the lie another time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  I did not give the lie! Out o’ your wits and</p>

<p>hearing too? A pox o’ your bottle! This can sack and</p>

<p>drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the</p>

<p>devil take your fingers!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span>  Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Now forward with your tale. <i>[To Trinculo.]</i></p>

<p>Prithee, stand further off.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span></p>

<p>Beat him enough. After a little time</p>

<p>I’ll beat him too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Stand farther. <i>[Trinculo moves farther</p>

<p>away.]</i> Come, proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span></p>

<p>Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him</p>

<p>I’ th’ afternoon to sleep. There thou mayst brain him,</p>

<p>Having first seized his books, or with a log</p>

<p>Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,</p>

<p>Or cut his weasand with thy knife. Remember</p>

<p>First to possess his books, for without them</p>

<p>He’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not</p>

<p>One spirit to command. They all do hate him</p>

<p>As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.</p>

<p>He has brave utensils–for so he calls them–</p>

<p>Which, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.</p>

<p>And that most deeply to consider is</p>

<p>The beauty of his daughter. He himself</p>

<p>Calls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman</p>

<p>But only Sycorax my dam and she;</p>

<p>But she as far surpasseth Sycorax</p>

<p>As great’st does least.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Is it so brave a lass?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span></p>

<p>Ay, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant,</p>

<p>And bring thee forth brave brood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Monster, I will kill this man. His daughter</p>

<p>and I will be king and queen–save our Graces!–</p>

<p>and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.–Dost</p>

<p>thou like the plot, Trinculo?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  Excellent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Give me thy hand. I am sorry I beat thee.</p>

<p>But while thou liv’st, keep a good tongue in thy</p>

<p>head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span></p>

<p>Within this half hour will he be asleep.</p>

<p>Wilt thou destroy him then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Ay, on mine honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ariel</span> <i>[aside]</i>  This will I tell my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span></p>

<p>Thou mak’st me merry. I am full of pleasure.</p>

<p>Let us be jocund. Will you troll the catch</p>

<p>You taught me but whilere?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  At thy request, monster, I will do reason,</p>

<p>any reason.–Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sings.]</i></center></p>

<p>     <i>Flout ’em and cout ’em</i></p>

<p>     <i>And scout ’em and flout ’em!</i></p>

<p>        <i>Thought is free.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span>  That’s not the tune.</p>

<p><center><i>[Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  What is this same?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  This is the tune of our catch played by the</p>

<p>picture of Nobody.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span> <i>[to the invisible musician]</i>  If thou be’st a</p>

<p>man, show thyself in thy likeness. If thou be’st a</p>

<p>devil, take ’t as thou list.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  O, forgive me my sins!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  He that dies pays all debts.–I defy thee!–</p>

<p>Mercy upon us!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span>  Art thou afeard?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  No, monster, not I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span></p>

<p>Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises,</p>

<p>Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.</p>

<p>Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments</p>

<p>Will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices</p>

<p>That, if I then had waked after long sleep,</p>

<p>Will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming,</p>

<p>The clouds methought would open, and show riches</p>

<p>Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked</p>

<p>I cried to dream again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  This will prove a brave kingdom to me,</p>

<p>where I shall have my music for nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caliban</span>  When Prospero is destroyed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  That shall be by and by. I remember the</p>

<p>story.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  The sound is going away. Let’s follow it, and</p>

<p>after do our work.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  Lead, monster. We’ll follow.–I would I</p>

<p>could see this taborer. He lays it on. Wilt come?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trinculo</span>  I’ll follow, Stephano.</p>
