<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span></p>

<p>This is the air; that is the glorious sun.</p>

<p>This pearl she gave me, I do feel ’t and see ’t.</p>

<p>And though ’tis wonder that enwraps me thus,</p>

<p>Yet ’tis not madness. Where’s Antonio, then?</p>

<p>I could not find him at the Elephant.</p>

<p>Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,</p>

<p>That he did range the town to seek me out.</p>

<p>His counsel now might do me golden service.</p>

<p>For though my soul disputes well with my sense</p>

<p>That this may be some error, but no madness,</p>

<p>Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune</p>

<p>So far exceed all instance, all discourse,</p>

<p>That I am ready to distrust mine eyes</p>

<p>And wrangle with my reason that persuades me</p>

<p>To any other trust but that I am mad–</p>

<p>Or else the lady’s mad. Yet if ’twere so,</p>

<p>She could not sway her house, command her</p>

<p>followers,</p>

<p>Take and give back affairs and their dispatch</p>

<p>With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing</p>

<p>As I perceive she does. There’s something in ’t</p>

<p>That is deceivable. But here the lady comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Olivia, and a Priest.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span> <i>[to Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,</p>

<p>Now go with me and with this holy man</p>

<p>Into the chantry by. There, before him</p>

<p>And underneath that consecrated roof,</p>

<p>Plight me the full assurance of your faith,</p>

<p>That my most jealous and too doubtful soul</p>

<p>May live at peace. He shall conceal it</p>

<p>Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,</p>

<p>What time we will our celebration keep</p>

<p>According to my birth. What do you say?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sebastian</span></p>

<p>I’ll follow this good man and go with you,</p>

<p>And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>Then lead the way, good father, and heavens so</p>

<p>shine</p>

<p>That they may fairly note this act of mine.</p>
