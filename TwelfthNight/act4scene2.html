<p><center><i>[Enter Maria and Feste, the Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;</p>

<p>make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate. Do</p>

<p>it quickly. I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Well, I’ll put it on and I will dissemble myself in</p>

<p>’t, and I would I were the first that ever dissembled</p>

<p>in such a gown. <i>[He puts on gown and beard.]</i> I am</p>

<p>not tall enough to become the function well, nor</p>

<p>lean enough to be thought a good student, but to be</p>

<p>said an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as</p>

<p>fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar.</p>

<p>The competitors enter.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Toby and Maria.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Jove bless thee, Master Parson.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Bonos dies, Sir Toby; for, as the old hermit of</p>

<p>Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily said</p>

<p>to a niece of King Gorboduc “That that is, is,” so I,</p>

<p>being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for what is</p>

<p>“that” but “that” and “is” but “is”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  To him, Sir Topas.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[disguising his voice]</i>  What ho, I say! Peace in this</p>

<p>prison!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  The knave counterfeits well. A good knave.</p>

<br/>

<p><i>[Malvolio within.]</i> </p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Who calls there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio</p>

<p>the lunatic.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to</p>

<p>my lady–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Out, hyperbolical fiend! How vexest thou this</p>

<p>man! Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Well said, Master Parson.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged.</p>

<p>Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad. They have</p>

<p>laid me here in hideous darkness–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most</p>

<p>modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones</p>

<p>that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Sayst</p>

<p>thou that house is dark?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  As hell, Sir Topas.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,</p>

<p>and the clerestories toward the south-north</p>

<p>are as lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest</p>

<p>thou of obstruction?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this</p>

<p>house is dark.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Madman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness</p>

<p>but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than</p>

<p>the Egyptians in their fog.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  I say this house is as dark as ignorance,</p>

<p>though ignorance were as dark as hell. And I say</p>

<p>there was never man thus abused. I am no more</p>

<p>mad than you are. Make the trial of it in any</p>

<p>constant question.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning</p>

<p>wildfowl?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  That the soul of our grandam might haply</p>

<p>inhabit a bird.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  What thinkst thou of his opinion?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  I think nobly of the soul, and no way</p>

<p>approve his opinion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness.</p>

<p>Thou shalt hold th’ opinion of Pythagoras ere I will</p>

<p>allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock lest</p>

<p>thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee</p>

<p>well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Sir Topas, Sir Topas!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  My most exquisite Sir Topas!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Nay, I am for all waters.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Thou mightst have done this without thy beard</p>

<p>and gown. He sees thee not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  To him in thine own voice, and bring me word</p>

<p>how thou find’st him. I would we were well rid</p>

<p>of this knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered,</p>

<p>I would he were, for I am now so far in</p>

<p>offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with</p>

<p>any safety this sport the upshot. Come by and by</p>

<p>to my chamber.</p>

<p><center><i>[Toby and Maria exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[sings, in his own voice]</i></p>

<p>Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,</p>

<p>Tell me how thy lady does.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Fool!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>My lady is unkind, perdy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Fool!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>Alas, why is she so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Fool, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>She loves another–</p>

<p>Who calls, ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at</p>

<p>my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and</p>

<p>paper. As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful</p>

<p>to thee for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Master Malvolio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Ay, good Fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Fool, there was never man so notoriously</p>

<p>abused. I am as well in my wits, Fool, as thou art.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  But as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be</p>

<p>no better in your wits than a Fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  They have here propertied me, keep me in</p>

<p>darkness, send ministers to me–asses!–and do</p>

<p>all they can to face me out of my wits.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Advise you what you say. The minister is here.</p>

<p><i>[In the voice of Sir Topas.]</i> Malvolio, Malvolio, thy</p>

<p>wits the heavens restore. Endeavor thyself to sleep</p>

<p>and leave thy vain bibble-babble.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Sir Topas!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[as Sir Topas]</i>  Maintain no words with him, good</p>

<p>fellow. <i>[As Fool.]</i> Who, I, sir? Not I, sir! God buy</p>

<p>you, good Sir Topas. <i>[As Sir Topas.]</i> Marry, amen.</p>

<p><i>[As Fool.]</i> I will, sir, I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Fool! Fool! Fool, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Alas, sir, be patient. What say you, sir? I am</p>

<p>shent for speaking to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Good Fool, help me to some light and some</p>

<p>paper. I tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any</p>

<p>man in Illyria.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Welladay that you were, sir!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  By this hand, I am. Good Fool, some ink,</p>

<p>paper, and light; and convey what I will set down to</p>

<p>my lady. It shall advantage thee more than ever the</p>

<p>bearing of letter did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I will help you to ’t. But tell me true, are you not</p>

<p>mad indeed, or do you but counterfeit?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Believe me, I am not. I tell thee true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Nay, I’ll ne’er believe a madman till I see his</p>

<p>brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree. I</p>

<p>prithee, begone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>I am gone, sir, and anon, sir,</i></p>

<p>        <i>I’ll be with you again,</i></p>

<p>     <i>In a trice, like to the old Vice,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Your need to sustain.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Who with dagger of lath, in his rage and his wrath,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Cries “aha!” to the devil;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Like a mad lad, “Pare thy nails, dad!</i></p>

<p>        <i>Adieu, goodman devil.”</i></p>
