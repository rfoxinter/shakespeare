<p><center><i>[Enter Orsino, Viola, Curio, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Give me some music. <i>[Music plays.]</i> Now, good</p>

<p>morrow, friends.–</p>

<p>Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,</p>

<p>That old and antique song we heard last night.</p>

<p>Methought it did relieve my passion much,</p>

<p>More than light airs and recollected terms</p>

<p>Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times.</p>

<p>Come, but one verse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curio</sc>  He is not here, so please your Lordship, that</p>

<p>should sing it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  Who was it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curio</sc>  Feste the jester, my lord, a Fool that the Lady</p>

<p>Olivia’s father took much delight in. He is about</p>

<p>the house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Seek him out <i>[Curio exits,]</i> and play the tune the</p>

<p>while.     <i><i>[Music plays.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[To Viola.]</i> Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,</p>

<p>In the sweet pangs of it remember me,</p>

<p>For such as I am, all true lovers are,</p>

<p>Unstaid and skittish in all motions else</p>

<p>Save in the constant image of the creature</p>

<p>That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>It gives a very echo to the seat</p>

<p>Where love is throned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  Thou dost speak masterly.</p>

<p>My life upon ’t, young though thou art, thine eye</p>

<p>Hath stayed upon some favor that it loves.</p>

<p>Hath it not, boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  A little, by your favor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>What kind of woman is ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  Of your complexion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>She is not worth thee, then. What years, i’ faith?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  About your years, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Too old, by heaven. Let still the woman take</p>

<p>An elder than herself. So wears she to him;</p>

<p>So sways she level in her husband’s heart.</p>

<p>For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,</p>

<p>Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,</p>

<p>More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,</p>

<p>Than women’s are.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  I think it well, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Then let thy love be younger than thyself,</p>

<p>Or thy affection cannot hold the bent.</p>

<p>For women are as roses, whose fair flower,</p>

<p>Being once displayed, doth fall that very hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>And so they are. Alas, that they are so,</p>

<p>To die even when they to perfection grow!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Curio and Feste, the Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.–</p>

<p>Mark it, Cesario. It is old and plain;</p>

<p>The spinsters and the knitters in the sun</p>

<p>And the free maids that weave their thread with</p>

<p>bones</p>

<p>Do use to chant it. It is silly sooth,</p>

<p>And dallies with the innocence of love</p>

<p>Like the old age.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Are you ready, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  Ay, prithee, sing.     <i><i>[Music.]</i></i></p>

<p>The Song.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Come away, come away, death,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And in sad cypress let me be laid.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fly away, fly away, breath,</i></p>

<p>        <i>I am slain by a fair cruel maid.</i></p>

<p>     <i>My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,</i></p>

<p>        <i>O, prepare it!</i></p>

<p>     <i>My part of death, no one so true</i></p>

<p>        <i>Did share it.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>Not a flower, not a flower sweet</i></p>

<p>        <i>On my black coffin let there be strown;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Not a friend, not a friend greet</i></p>

<p>        <i>My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown.</i></p>

<p>     <i>A thousand thousand sighs to save,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Lay me, O, where</i></p>

<p>     <i>Sad true lover never find my grave</i></p>

<p>        <i>To weep there.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc> <i>[giving money]</i>  There’s for thy pains.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  No pains, sir. I take pleasure in singing, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  I’ll pay thy pleasure, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Truly sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or</p>

<p>another.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  Give me now leave to leave thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Now the melancholy god protect thee and the</p>

<p>tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy</p>

<p>mind is a very opal. I would have men of such</p>

<p>constancy put to sea, that their business might be</p>

<p>everything and their intent everywhere, for that’s it</p>

<p>that always makes a good voyage of nothing.</p>

<p>Farewell.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Let all the rest give place.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Orsino and Viola exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Once more, Cesario,</p>

<p>Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.</p>

<p>Tell her my love, more noble than the world,</p>

<p>Prizes not quantity of dirty lands.</p>

<p>The parts that Fortune hath bestowed upon her,</p>

<p>Tell her, I hold as giddily as Fortune.</p>

<p>But ’tis that miracle and queen of gems</p>

<p>That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  But if she cannot love you, sir–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>I cannot be so answered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  Sooth, but you must.</p>

<p>Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,</p>

<p>Hath for your love as great a pang of heart</p>

<p>As you have for Olivia. You cannot love her;</p>

<p>You tell her so. Must she not then be answered?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  There is no woman’s sides</p>

<p>Can bide the beating of so strong a passion</p>

<p>As love doth give my heart; no woman’s heart</p>

<p>So big, to hold so much; they lack retention.</p>

<p>Alas, their love may be called appetite,</p>

<p>No motion of the liver but the palate,</p>

<p>That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;</p>

<p>But mine is all as hungry as the sea,</p>

<p>And can digest as much. Make no compare</p>

<p>Between that love a woman can bear me</p>

<p>And that I owe Olivia.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  Ay, but I know–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  What dost thou know?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>Too well what love women to men may owe.</p>

<p>In faith, they are as true of heart as we.</p>

<p>My father had a daughter loved a man</p>

<p>As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,</p>

<p>I should your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  And what’s her history?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>A blank, my lord. She never told her love,</p>

<p>But let concealment, like a worm i’ th’ bud,</p>

<p>Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought,</p>

<p>And with a green and yellow melancholy</p>

<p>She sat like Patience on a monument,</p>

<p>Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?</p>

<p>We men may say more, swear more, but indeed</p>

<p>Our shows are more than will; for still we prove</p>

<p>Much in our vows but little in our love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>But died thy sister of her love, my boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>I am all the daughters of my father’s house,</p>

<p>And all the brothers, too–and yet I know not.</p>

<p>Sir, shall I to this lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  Ay, that’s the theme.</p>

<p>To her in haste. Give her this jewel. Say</p>

<p>My love can give no place, bide no denay.</p>
