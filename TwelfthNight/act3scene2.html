<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  No, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fabian</sc>  You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the</p>

<p>Count’s servingman than ever she bestowed upon</p>

<p>me. I saw ’t i’ th’ orchard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me</p>

<p>that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  As plain as I see you now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fabian</sc>  This was a great argument of love in her toward</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  ’Slight, will you make an ass o’ me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fabian</sc>  I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of</p>

<p>judgment and reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  And they have been grand-jurymen since before</p>

<p>Noah was a sailor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fabian</sc>  She did show favor to the youth in your sight</p>

<p>only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse</p>

<p>valor, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in</p>

<p>your liver. You should then have accosted her, and</p>

<p>with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint,</p>

<p>you should have banged the youth into dumbness.</p>

<p>This was looked for at your hand, and this was</p>

<p>balked. The double gilt of this opportunity you let</p>

<p>time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north</p>

<p>of my lady’s opinion, where you will hang like an</p>

<p>icicle on a Dutchman’s beard, unless you do redeem</p>

<p>it by some laudable attempt either of valor or</p>

<p>policy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  An ’t be any way, it must be with valor, for</p>

<p>policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a</p>

<p>politician.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis</p>

<p>of valor. Challenge me the Count’s youth to fight</p>

<p>with him. Hurt him in eleven places. My niece shall</p>

<p>take note of it, and assure thyself there is no</p>

<p>love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s</p>

<p>commendation with woman than report of valor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fabian</sc>  There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  Go, write it in a martial hand. Be curst and</p>

<p>brief. It is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent</p>

<p>and full of invention. Taunt him with the license of</p>

<p>ink. If thou “thou”-est him some thrice, it shall not</p>

<p>be amiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of</p>

<p>paper, although the sheet were big enough for the</p>

<p>bed of Ware in England, set ’em down. Go, about it.</p>

<p>Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou</p>

<p>write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  Where shall I find you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  We’ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sir Andrew exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fabian</sc>  This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand</p>

<p>strong or so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fabian</sc>  We shall have a rare letter from him. But you’ll</p>

<p>not deliver ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  Never trust me, then. And by all means stir on</p>

<p>the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes</p>

<p>cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were</p>

<p>opened and you find so much blood in his liver as</p>

<p>will clog the foot of a flea, I’ll eat the rest of th’</p>

<p>anatomy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fabian</sc>  And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage</p>

<p>no great presage of cruelty.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Maria.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  Look where the youngest wren of mine comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maria</sc>  If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves</p>

<p>into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is</p>

<p>turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no</p>

<p>Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly</p>

<p>can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness.</p>

<p>He’s in yellow stockings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  And cross-gartered?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maria</sc>  Most villainously, like a pedant that keeps a</p>

<p>school i’ th’ church. I have dogged him like his</p>

<p>murderer. He does obey every point of the letter</p>

<p>that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face</p>

<p>into more lines than is in the new map with the</p>

<p>augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such</p>

<p>a thing as ’tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things at</p>

<p>him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he’ll</p>

<p>smile and take ’t for a great favor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  Come, bring us, bring us where he is.</p>
