<p><center><i>[Enter Sebastian and Antonio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc></p>

<p>I would not by my will have troubled you,</p>

<p>But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,</p>

<p>I will no further chide you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>I could not stay behind you. My desire,</p>

<p>More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;</p>

<p>And not all love to see you, though so much</p>

<p>As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,</p>

<p>But jealousy what might befall your travel,</p>

<p>Being skill-less in these parts, which to a stranger,</p>

<p>Unguided and unfriended, often prove</p>

<p>Rough and unhospitable. My willing love,</p>

<p>The rather by these arguments of fear,</p>

<p>Set forth in your pursuit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  My kind Antonio,</p>

<p>I can no other answer make but thanks,</p>

<p>And thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns</p>

<p>Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.</p>

<p>But were my worth, as is my conscience, firm,</p>

<p>You should find better dealing. What’s to do?</p>

<p>Shall we go see the relics of this town?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Tomorrow, sir. Best first go see your lodging.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc></p>

<p>I am not weary, and ’tis long to night.</p>

<p>I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes</p>

<p>With the memorials and the things of fame</p>

<p>That do renown this city.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  Would you’d pardon me.</p>

<p>I do not without danger walk these streets.</p>

<p>Once in a sea fight ’gainst the Count his galleys</p>

<p>I did some service, of such note indeed</p>

<p>That were I ta’en here it would scarce be answered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc></p>

<p>Belike you slew great number of his people?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Th’ offense is not of such a bloody nature,</p>

<p>Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel</p>

<p>Might well have given us bloody argument.</p>

<p>It might have since been answered in repaying</p>

<p>What we took from them, which, for traffic’s sake,</p>

<p>Most of our city did. Only myself stood out,</p>

<p>For which, if I be lapsed in this place,</p>

<p>I shall pay dear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  Do not then walk too open.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here’s my purse.</p>

<p><center><i>[Giving him money.]</i></center></p>

<p>In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,</p>

<p>Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet</p>

<p>Whiles you beguile the time and feed your</p>

<p>knowledge</p>

<p>With viewing of the town. There shall you have me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  Why I your purse?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Haply your eye shall light upon some toy</p>

<p>You have desire to purchase, and your store,</p>

<p>I think, is not for idle markets, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc></p>

<p>I’ll be your purse-bearer and leave you</p>

<p>For an hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  To th’ Elephant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  I do remember.</p>
