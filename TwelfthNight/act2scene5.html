<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Nay, I’ll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport,</p>

<p>let me be boiled to death with melancholy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly</p>

<p>rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  I would exult, man. You know he brought me</p>

<p>out o’ favor with my lady about a bearbaiting here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  To anger him, we’ll have the bear again, and we</p>

<p>will fool him black and blue, shall we not, Sir</p>

<p>Andrew?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  An we do not, it is pity of our lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Maria.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Here comes the little villain.–How now, my</p>

<p>metal of India?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Get you all three into the boxtree. Malvolio’s</p>

<p>coming down this walk. He has been yonder i’ the</p>

<p>sun practicing behavior to his own shadow this half</p>

<p>hour. Observe him, for the love of mockery, for I</p>

<p>know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of</p>

<p>him. Close, in the name of jesting! <i>[They hide.]</i> Lie</p>

<p>thou there <i>[putting down the letter,]</i> for here comes</p>

<p>the trout that must be caught with tickling.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Malvolio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  ’Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once</p>

<p>told me she did affect me, and I have heard herself</p>

<p>come thus near, that should she fancy, it should be</p>

<p>one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a</p>

<p>more exalted respect than anyone else that follows</p>

<p>her. What should I think on ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Here’s an overweening rogue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare</p>

<p>turkeycock of him. How he jets under his advanced</p>

<p>plumes!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> <i>[aside]</i>  ’Slight, I could so beat the rogue!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Peace, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  To be Count Malvolio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Ah, rogue!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Pistol him, pistol him!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Peace, peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  There is example for ’t. The lady of the</p>

<p>Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Fie on him, Jezebel!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  O, peace, now he’s deeply in. Look how</p>

<p>imagination blows him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Having been three months married to her,</p>

<p>sitting in my state–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Calling my officers about me, in my</p>

<p>branched velvet gown, having come from a daybed</p>

<p>where I have left Olivia sleeping–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Fire and brimstone!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  O, peace, peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  And then to have the humor of state; and</p>

<p>after a demure travel of regard, telling them I</p>

<p>know my place, as I would they should do theirs, to</p>

<p>ask for my kinsman Toby–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Bolts and shackles!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  O, peace, peace, peace! Now, now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Seven of my people, with an obedient start,</p>

<p>make out for him. I frown the while, and perchance</p>

<p>wind up my watch, or play with my–some</p>

<p>rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Shall this fellow live?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Though our silence be drawn from us</p>

<p>with cars, yet peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  I extend my hand to him thus, quenching</p>

<p>my familiar smile with an austere regard of</p>

<p>control–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  And does not Toby take you a blow o’ the</p>

<p>lips then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Saying, “Cousin Toby, my fortunes, having</p>

<p>cast me on your niece, give me this prerogative of</p>

<p>speech–”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  What, what?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “You must amend your drunkenness.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Out, scab!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Nay, patience, or we break the sinews</p>

<p>of our plot!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “Besides, you waste the treasure of your</p>

<p>time with a foolish knight–”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> <i>[aside]</i>  That’s me, I warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “One Sir Andrew.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> <i>[aside]</i>  I knew ’twas I, for many do call me</p>

<p>fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span> <i>[seeing the letter]</i>  What employment have</p>

<p>we here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Now is the woodcock near the gin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  O, peace, and the spirit of humors intimate</p>

<p>reading aloud to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span> <i>[taking up the letter]</i>  By my life, this is my</p>

<p>lady’s hand! These be her very c’s, her u’s, and her</p>

<p>t’s, and thus she makes her great P’s. It is in</p>

<p>contempt of question her hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Her c’s, her u’s, and her t’s. Why that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span> <i>[reads]</i>  To the unknown beloved, this, and my</p>

<p>good wishes–Her very phrases! By your leave, wax.</p>

<p>Soft. And the impressure her Lucrece, with which</p>

<p>she uses to seal–’tis my lady! <i>[He opens the letter.]</i></p>

<p>To whom should this be?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  This wins him, liver and all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span> <i>[reads]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Jove knows I love,</i></p>

<p>        <i>But who?</i></p>

<p>     <i>Lips, do not move;</i></p>

<p>        <i>No man must know.</i></p>

<p>“No man must know.” What follows? The numbers</p>

<p>altered. “No man must know.” If this should be</p>

<p>thee, Malvolio!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Marry, hang thee, brock!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span> <i>[reads]</i></p>

<p>     <i>I may command where I adore,</i></p>

<p>        <i>But silence, like a Lucrece knife,</i></p>

<p>     <i>With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore;</i></p>

<p>        <i>M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  A fustian riddle!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Excellent wench, say I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.” Nay, but first</p>

<p>let me see, let me see, let me see.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  What dish o’ poison has she dressed</p>

<p>him!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  And with what wing the staniel checks</p>

<p>at it!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “I may command where I adore.” Why, she</p>

<p>may command me; I serve her; she is my lady. Why,</p>

<p>this is evident to any formal capacity. There is no</p>

<p>obstruction in this. And the end–what should that</p>

<p>alphabetical position portend? If I could make that</p>

<p>resemble something in me! Softly! “M.O.A.I.”–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  O, ay, make up that.–He is now at a cold</p>

<p>scent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Sowter will cry upon ’t for all this,</p>

<p>though it be as rank as a fox.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “M”–Malvolio. “M”–why, that begins</p>

<p>my name!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Did not I say he would work it out? The</p>

<p>cur is excellent at faults.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “M.” But then there is no consonancy in</p>

<p>the sequel that suffers under probation. “A” should</p>

<p>follow, but “O” does.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  And “O” shall end, I hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Ay, or I’ll cudgel him and make him cry</p>

<p>“O.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  And then “I” comes behind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you</p>

<p>might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes</p>

<p>before you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “M.O.A.I.” This simulation is not as the</p>

<p>former, and yet to crush this a little, it would bow</p>

<p>to me, for every one of these letters are in my name.</p>

<p>Soft, here follows prose.</p>

<p><i>[He reads.]</i> If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my</p>

<p>stars I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness.</p>

<p>Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and</p>

<p>some have greatness thrust upon ’em. Thy fates open</p>

<p>their hands. Let thy blood and spirit embrace them.</p>

<p>And, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast</p>

<p>thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with</p>

<p>a kinsman, surly with servants. Let thy tongue tang</p>

<p>arguments of state. Put thyself into the trick of singularity.</p>

<p>She thus advises thee that sighs for thee.</p>

<p>Remember who commended thy yellow stockings and</p>

<p>wished to see thee ever cross-gartered. I say, remember.</p>

<p>Go to, thou art made, if thou desir’st to be so. If</p>

<p>not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of</p>

<p>servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune’s fingers.</p>

<p>Farewell. She that would alter services with thee,</p>

<p>The Fortunate-Unhappy.</p>

<p>Daylight and champian discovers not more! This is</p>

<p>open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I</p>

<p>will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance,</p>

<p>I will be point-devise the very man. I do not</p>

<p>now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for</p>

<p>every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me.</p>

<p>She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she</p>

<p>did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this</p>

<p>she manifests herself to my love and, with a kind of</p>

<p>injunction, drives me to these habits of her liking. I</p>

<p>thank my stars, I am happy. I will be strange, stout,</p>

<p>in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with</p>

<p>the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be</p>

<p>praised! Here is yet a postscript.</p>

<p><i>[He reads.]</i> Thou canst not choose but know who I</p>

<p>am. If thou entertain’st my love, let it appear in thy</p>

<p>smiling; thy smiles become thee well. Therefore in my</p>

<p>presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.</p>

<p>Jove, I thank thee! I will smile. I will do everything</p>

<p>that thou wilt have me.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  I will not give my part of this sport for a</p>

<p>pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  I could marry this wench for this device.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  So could I too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  And ask no other dowry with her but such</p>

<p>another jest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Nor I neither.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Maria.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Here comes my noble gull-catcher.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Wilt thou set thy foot o’ my neck?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Or o’ mine either?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip and become</p>

<p>thy bondslave?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  I’ faith, or I either?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Why, thou hast put him in such a dream that</p>

<p>when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Like aqua vitae with a midwife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  If you will then see the fruits of the sport,</p>

<p>mark his first approach before my lady. He will</p>

<p>come to her in yellow stockings, and ’tis a color</p>

<p>she abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;</p>

<p>and he will smile upon her, which will now</p>

<p>be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted</p>

<p>to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot</p>

<p>but turn him into a notable contempt. If you will</p>

<p>see it, follow me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil</p>

<p>of wit!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  I’ll make one, too.</p>
