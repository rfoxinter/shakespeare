<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Approach, Sir Andrew. Not to be abed after</p>

<p>midnight is to be up betimes, and “diluculo surgere,”</p>

<p>thou know’st–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Nay, by my troth, I know not. But I know to</p>

<p>be up late is to be up late.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  A false conclusion. I hate it as an unfilled can. To</p>

<p>be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early,</p>

<p>so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed</p>

<p>betimes. Does not our lives consist of the four</p>

<p>elements?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists</p>

<p>of eating and drinking.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Thou ’rt a scholar. Let us therefore eat and</p>

<p>drink. Marian, I say, a stoup of wine!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Feste, the Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Here comes the Fool, i’ faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  How now, my hearts? Did you never see the</p>

<p>picture of “We Three”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Welcome, ass! Now let’s have a catch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  By my troth, the Fool has an excellent breast.</p>

<p>I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,</p>

<p>and so sweet a breath to sing, as the Fool has.–In</p>

<p>sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night</p>

<p>when thou spok’st of Pigrogromitus of the Vapians</p>

<p>passing the equinoctial of Queubus. ’Twas very</p>

<p>good, i’ faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman.</p>

<p>Hadst it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I did impeticos thy gratillity, for Malvolio’s nose</p>

<p>is no whipstock, my lady has a white hand, and the</p>

<p>Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling when</p>

<p>all is done. Now, a song!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[giving money to the Fool]</i>  Come on, there is</p>

<p>sixpence for you. Let’s have a song.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> <i>[giving money to the Fool]</i>  There’s a testril of</p>

<p>me, too. If one knight give a–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Would you have a love song or a song of good</p>

<p>life?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  A love song, a love song.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Ay, ay, I care not for good life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>O mistress mine, where are you roaming?</i></p>

<p>     <i>O, stay and hear! Your truelove’s coming,</i></p>

<p>        <i>That can sing both high and low.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Trip no further, pretty sweeting.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Journeys end in lovers meeting,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Every wise man’s son doth know.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Excellent good, i’ faith!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Good, good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>What is love? ’Tis not hereafter.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Present mirth hath present laughter.</i></p>

<p>        <i>What’s to come is still unsure.</i></p>

<p>     <i>In delay there lies no plenty,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Youth’s a stuff will not endure.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  A contagious breath.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Very sweet and contagious, i’ faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.</p>

<p>But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall</p>

<p>we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw</p>

<p>three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  An you love me, let’s do ’t. I am dog at a</p>

<p>catch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  By ’r Lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Most certain. Let our catch be “Thou</p>

<p>Knave.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  “Hold thy peace, thou knave,” knight? I shall be</p>

<p>constrained in ’t to call thee “knave,” knight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  ’Tis not the first time I have constrained one</p>

<p>to call me “knave.” Begin, Fool. It begins “Hold</p>

<p>thy peace.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I shall never begin if I hold my peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Good, i’ faith. Come, begin.     <i><i>[Catch sung.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Maria.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my</p>

<p>lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and</p>

<p>bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  My lady’s a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio’s</p>

<p>a Peg-a-Ramsey, and <i>[Sings.]</i> Three merry men be</p>

<p>we. Am not I consanguineous? Am I not of her</p>

<p>blood? Tillyvally! “Lady”! <i>[Sings.]</i> There dwelt a man</p>

<p>in Babylon, lady, lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Beshrew me, the knight’s in admirable fooling.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed,</p>

<p>and so do I, too. He does it with a better grace, but</p>

<p>I do it more natural.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[sings]</i>  O’ the twelfth day of December–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  For the love o’ God, peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Malvolio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  My masters, are you mad? Or what are you?</p>

<p>Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty but to</p>

<p>gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do you</p>

<p>make an ale-house of my lady’s house, that you</p>

<p>squeak out your coziers’ catches without any mitigation</p>

<p>or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of</p>

<p>place, persons, nor time in you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady</p>

<p>bade me tell you that, though she harbors you as her</p>

<p>kinsman, she’s nothing allied to your disorders. If</p>

<p>you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors,</p>

<p>you are welcome to the house; if not, an it would</p>

<p>please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to</p>

<p>bid you farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Nay, good Sir Toby.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>His eyes do show his days are almost done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Is ’t even so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>But I will never die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>Sir Toby, there you lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  This is much credit to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>Shall I bid him go?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>What an if you do?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>Shall I bid him go, and spare not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>O no, no, no, no, you dare not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Out o’ tune, sir? You lie. Art any more than a</p>

<p>steward? Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous,</p>

<p>there shall be no more cakes and ale?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i’ th’</p>

<p>mouth, too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Thou ’rt i’ th’ right.–Go, sir, rub your chain</p>

<p>with crumbs.–A stoup of wine, Maria!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady’s favor</p>

<p>at anything more than contempt, you would not give</p>

<p>means for this uncivil rule. She shall know of it, by</p>

<p>this hand.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Go shake your ears!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  ’Twere as good a deed as to drink when a</p>

<p>man’s a-hungry, to challenge him the field and</p>

<p>then to break promise with him and make a fool of</p>

<p>him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Do ’t, knight. I’ll write thee a challenge. Or I’ll</p>

<p>deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the</p>

<p>youth of the Count’s was today with my lady, she is</p>

<p>much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me</p>

<p>alone with him. If I do not gull him into a nayword</p>

<p>and make him a common recreation, do not think I</p>

<p>have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I</p>

<p>can do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Possess us, possess us, tell us something of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  O, if I thought that, I’d beat him like a dog!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  What, for being a puritan? Thy exquisite reason,</p>

<p>dear knight?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  I have no exquisite reason for ’t, but I have</p>

<p>reason good enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  The devil a puritan that he is, or anything</p>

<p>constantly but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass</p>

<p>that cons state without book and utters it by great</p>

<p>swaths; the best persuaded of himself, so crammed,</p>

<p>as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is his grounds</p>

<p>of faith that all that look on him love him. And on</p>

<p>that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause</p>

<p>to work.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  What wilt thou do?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of</p>

<p>love, wherein by the color of his beard, the shape of</p>

<p>his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his</p>

<p>eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself</p>

<p>most feelingly personated. I can write very like my</p>

<p>lady your niece; on a forgotten matter, we can</p>

<p>hardly make distinction of our hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Excellent! I smell a device.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  I have ’t in my nose, too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,</p>

<p>that they come from my niece, and that she’s in</p>

<p>love with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  My purpose is indeed a horse of that color.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  And your horse now would make him an ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Ass, I doubt not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  O, ’twill be admirable!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic</p>

<p>will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the</p>

<p>Fool make a third, where he shall find the letter.</p>

<p>Observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed,</p>

<p>and dream on the event. Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Good night, Penthesilea.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Before me, she’s a good wench.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  She’s a beagle true bred, and one that adores</p>

<p>me. What o’ that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  I was adored once, too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Let’s to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for</p>

<p>more money.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way</p>

<p>out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Send for money, knight. If thou hast her not i’</p>

<p>th’ end, call me “Cut.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  If I do not, never trust me, take it how you</p>

<p>will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Come, come, I’ll go burn some sack. ’Tis too</p>

<p>late to go to bed now. Come, knight; come, knight.</p>
