<p><center><i>[Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  What country, friends, is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc>  This is Illyria, lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>And what should I do in Illyria?</p>

<p>My brother he is in Elysium.</p>

<p>Perchance he is not drowned.–What think you,</p>

<p>sailors?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>It is perchance that you yourself were saved.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>O, my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>True, madam. And to comfort you with chance,</p>

<p>Assure yourself, after our ship did split,</p>

<p>When you and those poor number saved with you</p>

<p>Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,</p>

<p>Most provident in peril, bind himself</p>

<p>(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)</p>

<p>To a strong mast that lived upon the sea,</p>

<p>Where, like Arion on the dolphin’s back,</p>

<p>I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves</p>

<p>So long as I could see.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc> <i>[giving him money]</i>  For saying so, there’s gold.</p>

<p>Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,</p>

<p>Whereto thy speech serves for authority,</p>

<p>The like of him. Know’st thou this country?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born</p>

<p>Not three hours’ travel from this very place.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  Who governs here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>A noble duke, in nature as in name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  What is his name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc>  Orsino.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>Orsino. I have heard my father name him.</p>

<p>He was a bachelor then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>And so is now, or was so very late;</p>

<p>For but a month ago I went from hence,</p>

<p>And then ’twas fresh in murmur (as, you know,</p>

<p>What great ones do the less will prattle of)</p>

<p>That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  What’s she?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count</p>

<p>That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her</p>

<p>In the protection of his son, her brother,</p>

<p>Who shortly also died, for whose dear love,</p>

<p>They say, she hath abjured the sight</p>

<p>And company of men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  O, that I served that lady,</p>

<p>And might not be delivered to the world</p>

<p>Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,</p>

<p>What my estate is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc>  That were hard to compass</p>

<p>Because she will admit no kind of suit,</p>

<p>No, not the Duke’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,</p>

<p>And though that nature with a beauteous wall</p>

<p>Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee</p>

<p>I will believe thou hast a mind that suits</p>

<p>With this thy fair and outward character.</p>

<p>I prithee–and I’ll pay thee bounteously–</p>

<p>Conceal me what I am, and be my aid</p>

<p>For such disguise as haply shall become</p>

<p>The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke.</p>

<p>Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him.</p>

<p>It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing</p>

<p>And speak to him in many sorts of music</p>

<p>That will allow me very worth his service.</p>

<p>What else may hap, to time I will commit.</p>

<p>Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be.</p>

<p>When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  I thank thee. Lead me on.</p>
