<p><center><i>[Enter Antonio and Sebastian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  Will you stay no longer? Nor will you not that</p>

<p>I go with you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly</p>

<p>over me. The malignancy of my fate might perhaps</p>

<p>distemper yours. Therefore I shall crave of you your</p>

<p>leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad</p>

<p>recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  Let me yet know of you whither you are</p>

<p>bound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  No, sooth, sir. My determinate voyage is</p>

<p>mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent</p>

<p>a touch of modesty that you will not extort</p>

<p>from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it</p>

<p>charges me in manners the rather to express myself.</p>

<p>You must know of me, then, Antonio, my name</p>

<p>is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was</p>

<p>that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have</p>

<p>heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister,</p>

<p>both born in an hour. If the heavens had been</p>

<p>pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir,</p>

<p>altered that, for some hour before you took me</p>

<p>from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  Alas the day!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  A lady, sir, though it was said she much</p>

<p>resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful.</p>

<p>But though I could not with such estimable</p>

<p>wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly</p>

<p>publish her: she bore a mind that envy could not but</p>

<p>call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water,</p>

<p>though I seem to drown her remembrance again</p>

<p>with more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  If you will not murder me for my love, let me</p>

<p>be your servant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  If you will not undo what you have done–</p>

<p>that is, kill him whom you have recovered–desire</p>

<p>it not. Fare you well at once. My bosom is full of</p>

<p>kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my</p>

<p>mother that, upon the least occasion more, mine</p>

<p>eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count</p>

<p>Orsino’s court. Farewell.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!</p>

<p>I have many enemies in Orsino’s court,</p>

<p>Else would I very shortly see thee there.</p>

<p>But come what may, I do adore thee so</p>

<p>That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.</p>
