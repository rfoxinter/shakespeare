<p><center><i>[Enter Feste, the Fool and Fabian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fabian</sc>  Now, as thou lov’st me, let me see his letter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fabian</sc>  Anything.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Do not desire to see this letter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fabian</sc>  This is to give a dog and in recompense desire</p>

<p>my dog again.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Orsino, Viola, Curio, and Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse</p>

<p>for my friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Just the contrary: the better for thy friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  No, sir, the worse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  How can that be?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me.</p>

<p>Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass; so that by</p>

<p>my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and</p>

<p>by my friends I am abused. So that, conclusions to</p>

<p>be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two</p>

<p>affirmatives, why then the worse for my friends and</p>

<p>the better for my foes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  Why, this is excellent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  By my troth, sir, no–though it please you to be</p>

<p>one of my friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc> <i>[giving a coin]</i></p>

<p>Thou shalt not be the worse for me; there’s gold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would</p>

<p>you could make it another.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  O, you give me ill counsel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,</p>

<p>and let your flesh and blood obey it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a</p>

<p>double-dealer: there’s another.     <i><i>[He gives a coin.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Primo, secundo, tertio is a good play, and the old</p>

<p>saying is, the third pays for all. The triplex, sir, is a</p>

<p>good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet,</p>

<p>sir, may put you in mind–one, two, three.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  You can fool no more money out of me at this</p>

<p>throw. If you will let your lady know I am here to</p>

<p>speak with her, and bring her along with you, it</p>

<p>may awake my bounty further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come</p>

<p>again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think</p>

<p>that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness.</p>

<p>But, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap. I</p>

<p>will awake it anon.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antonio and Officers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>That face of his I do remember well.</p>

<p>Yet when I saw it last, it was besmeared</p>

<p>As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war.</p>

<p>A baubling vessel was he captain of,</p>

<p>For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,</p>

<p>With which such scatheful grapple did he make</p>

<p>With the most noble bottom of our fleet</p>

<p>That very envy and the tongue of loss</p>

<p>Cried fame and honor on him.–What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Officer</sc></p>

<p>Orsino, this is that Antonio</p>

<p>That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,</p>

<p>And this is he that did the Tiger board</p>

<p>When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.</p>

<p>Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,</p>

<p>In private brabble did we apprehend him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,</p>

<p>But in conclusion put strange speech upon me.</p>

<p>I know not what ’twas but distraction.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Notable pirate, thou saltwater thief,</p>

<p>What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies</p>

<p>Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,</p>

<p>Hast made thine enemies?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  Orsino, noble sir,</p>

<p>Be pleased that I shake off these names you give</p>

<p>me.</p>

<p>Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,</p>

<p>Though, I confess, on base and ground enough,</p>

<p>Orsino’s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither.</p>

<p>That most ingrateful boy there by your side</p>

<p>From the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth</p>

<p>Did I redeem; a wrack past hope he was.</p>

<p>His life I gave him and did thereto add</p>

<p>My love, without retention or restraint,</p>

<p>All his in dedication. For his sake</p>

<p>Did I expose myself, pure for his love,</p>

<p>Into the danger of this adverse town;</p>

<p>Drew to defend him when he was beset;</p>

<p>Where, being apprehended, his false cunning</p>

<p>(Not meaning to partake with me in danger)</p>

<p>Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance</p>

<p>And grew a twenty years’ removed thing</p>

<p>While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,</p>

<p>Which I had recommended to his use</p>

<p>Not half an hour before.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  How can this be?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc> <i>[to Antonio]</i>  When came he to this town?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Today, my lord; and for three months before,</p>

<p>No int’rim, not a minute’s vacancy,</p>

<p>Both day and night did we keep company.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Olivia and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Here comes the Countess. Now heaven walks on</p>

<p>Earth!–</p>

<p>But for thee, fellow: fellow, thy words are madness.</p>

<p>Three months this youth hath tended upon me–</p>

<p>But more of that anon. <i>[To an Officer.]</i> Take him</p>

<p>aside.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc></p>

<p>What would my lord, but that he may not have,</p>

<p>Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?–</p>

<p>Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  Madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  Gracious Olivia–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc></p>

<p>What do you say, Cesario?–Good my lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc></p>

<p>If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,</p>

<p>It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear</p>

<p>As howling after music.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Still so cruel?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc>  Still so constant, lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>What, to perverseness? You, uncivil lady,</p>

<p>To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars</p>

<p>My soul the faithful’st off’rings have breathed out</p>

<p>That e’er devotion tendered–what shall I do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc></p>

<p>Even what it please my lord that shall become him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,</p>

<p>Like to th’ Egyptian thief at point of death,</p>

<p>Kill what I love?–a savage jealousy</p>

<p>That sometime savors nobly. But hear me this:</p>

<p>Since you to nonregardance cast my faith,</p>

<p>And that I partly know the instrument</p>

<p>That screws me from my true place in your favor,</p>

<p>Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still.</p>

<p>But this your minion, whom I know you love,</p>

<p>And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,</p>

<p>Him will I tear out of that cruel eye</p>

<p>Where he sits crowned in his master’s spite.–</p>

<p>Come, boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe in</p>

<p>mischief.</p>

<p>I’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love</p>

<p>To spite a raven’s heart within a dove.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,</p>

<p>To do you rest a thousand deaths would die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc></p>

<p>Where goes Cesario?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  After him I love</p>

<p>More than I love these eyes, more than my life,</p>

<p>More by all mores than e’er I shall love wife.</p>

<p>If I do feign, you witnesses above,</p>

<p>Punish my life for tainting of my love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc></p>

<p>Ay me, detested! How am I beguiled!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc></p>

<p>Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?–</p>

<p>Call forth the holy father.     <i><i>[An Attendant exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc> <i>[to Viola]</i>  Come, away!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc></p>

<p>Whither, my lord?–Cesario, husband, stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Husband?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc>  Ay, husband. Can he that deny?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Her husband, sirrah?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  No, my lord, not I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc></p>

<p>Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear</p>

<p>That makes thee strangle thy propriety.</p>

<p>Fear not, Cesario. Take thy fortunes up.</p>

<p>Be that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art</p>

<p>As great as that thou fear’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Priest.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O, welcome, father.</p>

<p>Father, I charge thee by thy reverence</p>

<p>Here to unfold (though lately we intended</p>

<p>To keep in darkness what occasion now</p>

<p>Reveals before ’tis ripe) what thou dost know</p>

<p>Hath newly passed between this youth and me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Priest</sc></p>

<p>A contract of eternal bond of love,</p>

<p>Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands,</p>

<p>Attested by the holy close of lips,</p>

<p>Strengthened by interchangement of your rings,</p>

<p>And all the ceremony of this compact</p>

<p>Sealed in my function, by my testimony;</p>

<p>Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my</p>

<p>grave</p>

<p>I have traveled but two hours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc> <i>[to Viola]</i></p>

<p>O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be</p>

<p>When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?</p>

<p>Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow</p>

<p>That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?</p>

<p>Farewell, and take her, but direct thy feet</p>

<p>Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I do protest–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc>  O, do not swear.</p>

<p>Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Andrew.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one</p>

<p>presently to Sir Toby.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc>  What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  Has broke my head across, and has given Sir</p>

<p>Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God,</p>

<p>your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at</p>

<p>home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc>  Who has done this, Sir Andrew?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario. We took</p>

<p>him for a coward, but he’s the very devil</p>

<p>incardinate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  My gentleman Cesario?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  ’Od’s lifelings, here he is!–You broke my</p>

<p>head for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to</p>

<p>do ’t by Sir Toby.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you.</p>

<p>You drew your sword upon me without cause,</p>

<p>But I bespake you fair and hurt you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt</p>

<p>me. I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Toby and Feste, the Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes Sir Toby halting. You shall hear</p>

<p>more. But if he had not been in drink, he would</p>

<p>have tickled you othergates than he did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc>  How now, gentleman? How is ’t with you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  That’s all one. Has hurt me, and there’s th’ end</p>

<p>on ’t. <i>[To Fool.]</i> Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  O, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes</p>

<p>were set at eight i’ th’ morning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  Then he’s a rogue and a passy-measures pavin. I</p>

<p>hate a drunken rogue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc>  Away with him! Who hath made this havoc</p>

<p>with them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andrew</sc>  I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be</p>

<p>dressed together.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Toby</sc>  Will you help?–an ass-head, and a coxcomb,</p>

<p>and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc></p>

<p>Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.</p>

<p><center><i>[Toby, Andrew, Fool, and Fabian exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sebastian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc></p>

<p>I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman,</p>

<p>But, had it been the brother of my blood,</p>

<p>I must have done no less with wit and safety.</p>

<p>You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that</p>

<p>I do perceive it hath offended you.</p>

<p>Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows</p>

<p>We made each other but so late ago.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!</p>

<p>A natural perspective, that is and is not!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc></p>

<p>Antonio, O, my dear Antonio!</p>

<p>How have the hours racked and tortured me</p>

<p>Since I have lost thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Sebastian are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  Fear’st thou that, Antonio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>How have you made division of yourself?</p>

<p>An apple cleft in two is not more twin</p>

<p>Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc>  Most wonderful!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc> <i>[looking at Viola]</i></p>

<p>Do I stand there? I never had a brother,</p>

<p>Nor can there be that deity in my nature</p>

<p>Of here and everywhere. I had a sister</p>

<p>Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured.</p>

<p>Of charity, what kin are you to me?</p>

<p>What countryman? What name? What parentage?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>Of Messaline. Sebastian was my father.</p>

<p>Such a Sebastian was my brother too.</p>

<p>So went he suited to his watery tomb.</p>

<p>If spirits can assume both form and suit,</p>

<p>You come to fright us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  A spirit I am indeed,</p>

<p>But am in that dimension grossly clad</p>

<p>Which from the womb I did participate.</p>

<p>Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,</p>

<p>I should my tears let fall upon your cheek</p>

<p>And say “Thrice welcome, drowned Viola.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>My father had a mole upon his brow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc>  And so had mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>And died that day when Viola from her birth</p>

<p>Had numbered thirteen years.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc></p>

<p>O, that record is lively in my soul!</p>

<p>He finished indeed his mortal act</p>

<p>That day that made my sister thirteen years.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>If nothing lets to make us happy both</p>

<p>But this my masculine usurped attire,</p>

<p>Do not embrace me till each circumstance</p>

<p>Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump</p>

<p>That I am Viola; which to confirm,</p>

<p>I’ll bring you to a captain in this town,</p>

<p>Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help</p>

<p>I was preserved to serve this noble count.</p>

<p>All the occurrence of my fortune since</p>

<p>Hath been between this lady and this lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sebastian</sc> <i>[to Olivia]</i></p>

<p>So comes it, lady, you have been mistook.</p>

<p>But nature to her bias drew in that.</p>

<p>You would have been contracted to a maid.</p>

<p>Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived:</p>

<p>You are betrothed both to a maid and man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc> <i>[to Olivia]</i></p>

<p>Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.</p>

<p>If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,</p>

<p>I shall have share in this most happy wrack.–</p>

<p>Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times</p>

<p>Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>And all those sayings will I overswear,</p>

<p>And all those swearings keep as true in soul</p>

<p>As doth that orbed continent the fire</p>

<p>That severs day from night.</p>

<br/>

<p>And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>The Captain that did bring me first on shore</p>

<p>Hath my maid’s garments. He, upon some action,</p>

<p>Is now in durance at Malvolio’s suit,</p>

<p>A gentleman and follower of my lady’s.</p>

<p>A most extracting frenzy of mine own</p>

<p><i>[To the Fool.]</i> How does he, sirrah?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the stave’s</p>

<p>end as well as a man in his case may do. Has here</p>

<p>writ a letter to you. I should have given ’t you today</p>

<p>morning. But as a madman’s epistles are no gospels,</p>

<p>so it skills not much when they are delivered.</p>

<p>Your master’s mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc> <i>[to Viola]</i>  A sister! You are she.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Malvolio and Fabian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Is this the madman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc>  Ay, my lord, this same.–</p>

<p>How now, Malvolio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Malvolio</sc>  Madam, you have done me</p>

<p>wrong,</p>

<p>Notorious wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc>  Have I, Malvolio? No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Malvolio</sc> <i>[handing her a paper]</i></p>

<p>Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.</p>

<p>You must not now deny it is your hand.</p>

<p>Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase,</p>

<p>Or say ’tis not your seal, not your invention.</p>

<p>You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,</p>

<p>And tell me, in the modesty of honor,</p>

<p>Why you have given me such clear lights of favor?</p>

<p>Bade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you,</p>

<p>To put on yellow stockings, and to frown</p>

<p>Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people?</p>

<p>And, acting this in an obedient hope,</p>

<p>Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned,</p>

<p>Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,</p>

<p>And made the most notorious geck and gull</p>

<p>That e’er invention played on? Tell me why.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc></p>

<p>Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,</p>

<p>Though I confess much like the character.</p>

<p>But out of question, ’tis Maria’s hand.</p>

<p>And now I do bethink me, it was she</p>

<p>First told me thou wast mad; then cam’st in smiling,</p>

<p>And in such forms which here were presupposed</p>

<p>Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content.</p>

<p>This practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee.</p>

<p>But when we know the grounds and authors of it,</p>

<p>Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge</p>

<p>Of thine own cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fabian</sc>  Good madam, hear me speak,</p>

<p>And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come</p>

<p>Taint the condition of this present hour,</p>

<p>Which I have wondered at. In hope it shall not,</p>

<p>Most freely I confess, myself and Toby</p>

<p>Set this device against Malvolio here,</p>

<p>Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts</p>

<p>We had conceived against him. Maria writ</p>

<p>The letter at Sir Toby’s great importance,</p>

<p>In recompense whereof he hath married her.</p>

<p>How with a sportful malice it was followed</p>

<p>May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,</p>

<p>If that the injuries be justly weighed</p>

<p>That have on both sides passed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc> <i>[to Malvolio]</i></p>

<p>Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Why, “some are born great, some achieve greatness,</p>

<p>and some have greatness thrown upon them.”</p>

<p>I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir,</p>

<p>but that’s all one. “By the Lord, Fool, I am not</p>

<p>mad”–but, do you remember “Madam, why laugh</p>

<p>you at such a barren rascal; an you smile not, he’s</p>

<p>gagged”? And thus the whirligig of time brings in</p>

<p>his revenges.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Malvolio</sc></p>

<p>I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you!     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Olivia</sc></p>

<p>He hath been most notoriously abused.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orsino</sc></p>

<p>Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.     <i><i>[Some exit.]</i></i></p>

<p>He hath not told us of the Captain yet.</p>

<p>When that is known, and golden time convents,</p>

<p>A solemn combination shall be made</p>

<p>Of our dear souls.–Meantime, sweet sister,</p>

<p>We will not part from hence.–Cesario, come,</p>

<p>For so you shall be while you are a man.</p>

<p>But when in other habits you are seen,</p>

<p>Orsino’s mistress, and his fancy’s queen.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but the Fool exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>When that I was and a little tiny boy,</i></p>

<p>        <i>With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</i></p>

<p>     <i>A foolish thing was but a toy,</i></p>

<p>        <i>For the rain it raineth every day.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>But when I came to man’s estate,</i></p>

<p>        <i>With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</i></p>

<p>     <i>’Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,</i></p>

<p>        <i>For the rain it raineth every day.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>But when I came, alas, to wive,</i></p>

<p>        <i>With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</i></p>

<p>     <i>By swaggering could I never thrive,</i></p>

<p>        <i>For the rain it raineth every day.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>But when I came unto my beds,</i></p>

<p>        <i>With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</i></p>

<p>     <i>With tosspots still had drunken heads,</i></p>

<p>        <i>For the rain it raineth every day.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>A great while ago the world begun,</i></p>

<p>        <i>With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</i></p>

<p>     <i>But that’s all one, our play is done,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And we’ll strive to please you every day.</i></p>
