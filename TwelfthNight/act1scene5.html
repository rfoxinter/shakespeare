<p><center><i>[Enter Maria and Feste, the Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I</p>

<p>will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter</p>

<p>in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy</p>

<p>absence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Let her hang me. He that is well hanged in this</p>

<p>world needs to fear no colors.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Make that good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  He shall see none to fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  A good Lenten answer. I can tell thee where</p>

<p>that saying was born, of “I fear no colors.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Where, good Mistress Mary?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in</p>

<p>your foolery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Well, God give them wisdom that have it, and</p>

<p>those that are Fools, let them use their talents.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent.</p>

<p>Or to be turned away, is not that as good as a</p>

<p>hanging to you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage,</p>

<p>and, for turning away, let summer bear it out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  You are resolute, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  That if one break, the other will hold, or if both</p>

<p>break, your gaskins fall.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Apt, in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way. If Sir</p>

<p>Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a</p>

<p>piece of Eve’s flesh as any in Illyria.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Peace, you rogue. No more o’ that. Here comes</p>

<p>my lady. Make your excuse wisely, you were best.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lady Olivia with Malvolio and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Wit, an ’t be thy will, put me into good</p>

<p>fooling! Those wits that think they have thee do very</p>

<p>oft prove fools, and I that am sure I lack thee may</p>

<p>pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus?</p>

<p>“Better a witty Fool than a foolish wit.”–God bless</p>

<p>thee, lady!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Take the Fool away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the Lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Go to, you’re a dry Fool. I’ll no more of you.</p>

<p>Besides, you grow dishonest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel</p>

<p>will amend. For give the dry Fool drink, then is</p>

<p>the Fool not dry. Bid the dishonest man mend</p>

<p>himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he</p>

<p>cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that’s</p>

<p>mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is</p>

<p>but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but</p>

<p>patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism</p>

<p>will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is</p>

<p>no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty’s a flower.</p>

<p>The Lady bade take away the Fool. Therefore, I say</p>

<p>again, take her away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Sir, I bade them take away you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus</p>

<p>non facit monachum. That’s as much to say as, I</p>

<p>wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give</p>

<p>me leave to prove you a fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Can you do it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Dexteriously, good madonna.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Make your proof.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my</p>

<p>mouse of virtue, answer me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll bide</p>

<p>your proof.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Good madonna, why mourn’st thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Good Fool, for my brother’s death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I think his soul is in hell, madonna.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  I know his soul is in heaven, Fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your</p>

<p>brother’s soul, being in heaven. Take away the fool,</p>

<p>gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  What think you of this Fool, Malvolio? Doth he</p>

<p>not mend?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death</p>

<p>shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth</p>

<p>ever make the better Fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the</p>

<p>better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn</p>

<p>that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for</p>

<p>twopence that you are no fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  How say you to that, Malvolio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  I marvel your Ladyship takes delight in</p>

<p>such a barren rascal. I saw him put down the other</p>

<p>day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain</p>

<p>than a stone. Look you now, he’s out of his guard</p>

<p>already. Unless you laugh and minister occasion to</p>

<p>him, he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men</p>

<p>that crow so at these set kind of Fools no better than</p>

<p>the Fools’ zanies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste</p>

<p>with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless,</p>

<p>and of free disposition is to take those things</p>

<p>for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There</p>

<p>is no slander in an allowed Fool, though he do</p>

<p>nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet</p>

<p>man, though he do nothing but reprove.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou</p>

<p>speak’st well of Fools!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Maria.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman</p>

<p>much desires to speak with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  From the Count Orsino, is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  I know not, madam. ’Tis a fair young man, and</p>

<p>well attended.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Who of my people hold him in delay?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Fetch him off, I pray you. He speaks nothing</p>

<p>but madman. Fie on him! <i>[Maria exits.]</i> Go you,</p>

<p>Malvolio. If it be a suit from the Count, I am sick,</p>

<p>or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it. <i>[(Malvolio</p>

<p>exits.)]</i> Now you see, sir, how your fooling</p>

<p>grows old, and people dislike it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest</p>

<p>son should be a Fool, whose skull Jove cram with</p>

<p>brains, for–here he comes–one of thy kin has a</p>

<p>most weak pia mater.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Toby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  By mine honor, half drunk!–What is he at the</p>

<p>gate, cousin?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  A gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  A gentleman? What gentleman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  ’Tis a gentleman here–a plague o’ these pickle</p>

<p>herring!–How now, sot?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Good Sir Toby.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by</p>

<p>this lethargy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Lechery? I defy lechery. There’s one at the gate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Ay, marry, what is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Let him be the devil an he will, I care not. Give</p>

<p>me faith, say I. Well, it’s all one.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  What’s a drunken man like, Fool?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Like a drowned man, a fool, and a madman. One</p>

<p>draught above heat makes him a fool, the second</p>

<p>mads him, and a third drowns him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Go thou and seek the crowner and let him sit o’</p>

<p>my coz, for he’s in the third degree of drink: he’s</p>

<p>drowned. Go look after him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  He is but mad yet, madonna, and the Fool shall</p>

<p>look to the madman.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Malvolio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Madam, yond young fellow swears he will</p>

<p>speak with you. I told him you were sick; he takes</p>

<p>on him to understand so much, and therefore</p>

<p>comes to speak with you. I told him you were</p>

<p>asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that</p>

<p>too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is</p>

<p>to be said to him, lady? He’s fortified against any</p>

<p>denial.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Tell him he shall not speak with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Has been told so, and he says he’ll stand at</p>

<p>your door like a sheriff’s post and be the supporter</p>

<p>to a bench, but he’ll speak with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  What kind o’ man is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Why, of mankind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  What manner of man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Of very ill manner. He’ll speak with you,</p>

<p>will you or no.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Of what personage and years is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Not yet old enough for a man, nor young</p>

<p>enough for a boy–as a squash is before ’tis a</p>

<p>peascod, or a codling when ’tis almost an apple. ’Tis</p>

<p>with him in standing water, between boy and man.</p>

<p>He is very well-favored, and he speaks very shrewishly.</p>

<p>One would think his mother’s milk were</p>

<p>scarce out of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Gentlewoman, my lady calls.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Maria.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>Give me my veil. Come, throw it o’er my face.</p>

<p><center><i>[Olivia veils.]</i></center></p>

<p>We’ll once more hear Orsino’s embassy.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Viola.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  The honorable lady of the house, which is she?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Speak to me. I shall answer for her. Your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable</p>

<p>beauty–I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the</p>

<p>house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast</p>

<p>away my speech, for, besides that it is excellently</p>

<p>well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good</p>

<p>beauties, let me sustain no scorn. I am very comptible</p>

<p>even to the least sinister usage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Whence came you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I can say little more than I have studied, and</p>

<p>that question’s out of my part. Good gentle one,</p>

<p>give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the</p>

<p>house, that I may proceed in my speech.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Are you a comedian?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  No, my profound heart. And yet by the very</p>

<p>fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play. Are</p>

<p>you the lady of the house?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  If I do not usurp myself, I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp</p>

<p>yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to</p>

<p>reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on</p>

<p>with my speech in your praise and then show you</p>

<p>the heart of my message.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Come to what is important in ’t. I forgive you</p>

<p>the praise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Alas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis</p>

<p>poetical.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  It is the more like to be feigned. I pray you,</p>

<p>keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and</p>

<p>allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than</p>

<p>to hear you. If you be not mad, begone; if you have</p>

<p>reason, be brief. ’Tis not that time of moon with me</p>

<p>to make one in so skipping a dialogue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little</p>

<p>longer.–Some mollification for your giant, sweet</p>

<p>lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Tell me your mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I am a messenger.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Sure you have some hideous matter to deliver</p>

<p>when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your</p>

<p>office.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture</p>

<p>of war, no taxation of homage. I hold the olive in</p>

<p>my hand. My words are as full of peace as matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Yet you began rudely. What are you? What</p>

<p>would you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I</p>

<p>learned from my entertainment. What I am and</p>

<p>what I would are as secret as maidenhead: to your</p>

<p>ears, divinity; to any other’s, profanation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Give us the place alone. We will hear this</p>

<p>divinity. <i>[Maria and Attendants exit.]</i> Now, sir, what</p>

<p>is your text?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Most sweet lady–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said</p>

<p>of it. Where lies your text?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  In Orsino’s bosom.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more</p>

<p>to say?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Good madam, let me see your face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Have you any commission from your lord to</p>

<p>negotiate with my face? You are now out of your</p>

<p>text. But we will draw the curtain and show you the</p>

<p>picture. <i>[She removes her veil.]</i> Look you, sir, such a</p>

<p>one I was this present. Is ’t not well done?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Excellently done, if God did all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  ’Tis in grain, sir; ’twill endure wind and</p>

<p>weather.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>’Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white</p>

<p>Nature’s own sweet and cunning hand laid on.</p>

<p>Lady, you are the cruel’st she alive</p>

<p>If you will lead these graces to the grave</p>

<p>And leave the world no copy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted! I will give</p>

<p>out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be</p>

<p>inventoried and every particle and utensil labeled</p>

<p>to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item,</p>

<p>two gray eyes with lids to them; item, one neck, one</p>

<p>chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise</p>

<p>me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>I see you what you are. You are too proud.</p>

<p>But if you were the devil you are fair.</p>

<p>My lord and master loves you. O, such love</p>

<p>Could be but recompensed though you were</p>

<p>crowned</p>

<p>The nonpareil of beauty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  How does he love me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  With adorations, fertile tears,</p>

<p>With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>Your lord does know my mind. I cannot love him.</p>

<p>Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,</p>

<p>Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;</p>

<p>In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant,</p>

<p>And in dimension and the shape of nature</p>

<p>A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.</p>

<p>He might have took his answer long ago.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>If I did love you in my master’s flame,</p>

<p>With such a suff’ring, such a deadly life,</p>

<p>In your denial I would find no sense.</p>

<p>I would not understand it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Why, what would you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>Make me a willow cabin at your gate</p>

<p>And call upon my soul within the house,</p>

<p>Write loyal cantons of contemned love</p>

<p>And sing them loud even in the dead of night,</p>

<p>Hallow your name to the reverberate hills</p>

<p>And make the babbling gossip of the air</p>

<p>Cry out “Olivia!” O, you should not rest</p>

<p>Between the elements of air and earth</p>

<p>But you should pity me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  You might do much.</p>

<p>What is your parentage?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.</p>

<p>I am a gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Get you to your lord.</p>

<p>I cannot love him. Let him send no more–</p>

<p>Unless perchance you come to me again</p>

<p>To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well.</p>

<p>I thank you for your pains. Spend this for me.</p>

<p><center><i>[She offers money.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>I am no fee’d post, lady. Keep your purse.</p>

<p>My master, not myself, lacks recompense.</p>

<p>Love make his heart of flint that you shall love,</p>

<p>And let your fervor, like my master’s, be</p>

<p>Placed in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  “What is your parentage?”</p>

<p>“Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.</p>

<p>I am a gentleman.” I’ll be sworn thou art.</p>

<p>Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit</p>

<p>Do give thee fivefold blazon. Not too fast! Soft,</p>

<p>soft!</p>

<p>Unless the master were the man. How now?</p>

<p>Even so quickly may one catch the plague?</p>

<p>Methinks I feel this youth’s perfections</p>

<p>With an invisible and subtle stealth</p>

<p>To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.–</p>

<p>What ho, Malvolio!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Malvolio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Here, madam, at your service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>Run after that same peevish messenger,</p>

<p>The County’s man. He left this ring behind him,</p>

<p>Would I or not. Tell him I’ll none of it.</p>

<p><center><i>[She hands him a ring.]</i></center></p>

<p>Desire him not to flatter with his lord,</p>

<p>Nor hold him up with hopes. I am not for him.</p>

<p>If that the youth will come this way tomorrow,</p>

<p>I’ll give him reasons for ’t. Hie thee, Malvolio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Madam, I will.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>I do I know not what, and fear to find</p>

<p>Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.</p>

<p>Fate, show thy force. Ourselves we do not owe.</p>

<p>What is decreed must be, and be this so.</p>
