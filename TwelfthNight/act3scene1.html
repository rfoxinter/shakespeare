<p><center><i>[Enter Viola and Feste, the Fool, playing a tabor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live</p>

<p>by thy tabor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  No, sir, I live by the church.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Art thou a churchman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  No such matter, sir. I do live by the church, for I</p>

<p>do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the</p>

<p>church.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a</p>

<p>beggar dwell near him, or the church stands by thy</p>

<p>tabor if thy tabor stand by the church.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is</p>

<p>but a chev’ril glove to a good wit. How quickly the</p>

<p>wrong side may be turned outward!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Nay, that’s certain. They that dally nicely with</p>

<p>words may quickly make them wanton.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I would therefore my sister had had no name,</p>

<p>sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Why, man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Why, sir, her name’s a word, and to dally with</p>

<p>that word might make my sister wanton. But,</p>

<p>indeed, words are very rascals since bonds disgraced</p>

<p>them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Thy reason, man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words,</p>

<p>and words are grown so false I am loath to prove</p>

<p>reason with them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I warrant thou art a merry fellow and car’st for</p>

<p>nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Not so, sir. I do care for something. But in my</p>

<p>conscience, sir, I do not care for you. If that be to</p>

<p>care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you</p>

<p>invisible.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Art not thou the Lady Olivia’s Fool?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  No, indeed, sir. The Lady Olivia has no folly. She</p>

<p>will keep no Fool, sir, till she be married, and Fools</p>

<p>are as like husbands as pilchers are to herrings: the</p>

<p>husband’s the bigger. I am indeed not her Fool but</p>

<p>her corrupter of words.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the</p>

<p>sun; it shines everywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but</p>

<p>the Fool should be as oft with your master as with</p>

<p>my mistress. I think I saw your Wisdom there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Nay, an thou pass upon me, I’ll no more with</p>

<p>thee. Hold, there’s expenses for thee. <i>[Giving a</p>

<p>coin.]</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send</p>

<p>thee a beard!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  By my troth I’ll tell thee, I am almost sick for</p>

<p>one, <i>[aside]</i> though I would not have it grow on my</p>

<p>chin.–Is thy lady within?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Yes, being kept together and put to use.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to</p>

<p>bring a Cressida to this Troilus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I understand you, sir. ’Tis well begged. <i>[Giving</p>

<p>another coin.]</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  The matter I hope is not great, sir, begging but a</p>

<p>beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir.</p>

<p>I will conster to them whence you come. Who you</p>

<p>are and what you would are out of my welkin–I</p>

<p>might say “element,” but the word is overworn.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>This fellow is wise enough to play the Fool,</p>

<p>And to do that well craves a kind of wit.</p>

<p>He must observe their mood on whom he jests,</p>

<p>The quality of persons, and the time,</p>

<p>And, like the haggard, check at every feather</p>

<p>That comes before his eye. This is a practice</p>

<p>As full of labor as a wise man’s art:</p>

<p>For folly that he wisely shows is fit;</p>

<p>But wise men, folly-fall’n, quite taint their wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Toby and Andrew.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Save you, gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  And you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Dieu vous garde, monsieur.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Et vous aussi. Votre serviteur! </p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Will you encounter the house? My niece is</p>

<p>desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the</p>

<p>list of my voyage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  My legs do better understand me, sir, than I</p>

<p>understand what you mean by bidding me taste my</p>

<p>legs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  I mean, to go, sir, to enter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I will answer you with gait and entrance–but</p>

<p>we are prevented.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Olivia, and Maria, her Gentlewoman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain</p>

<p>odors on you!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> <i>[aside]</i>  That youth’s a rare courtier. “Rain</p>

<p>odors,” well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own</p>

<p>most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> <i>[aside]</i>  “Odors,” “pregnant,” and “vouchsafed.”</p>

<p>I’ll get ’em all three all ready.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to</p>

<p>my hearing.     <i><i>[Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Maria exit.]</i></i></p>

<p>Give me your hand, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>My duty, madam, and most humble service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  What is your name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>Cesario is your servant’s name, fair princess.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>My servant, sir? ’Twas never merry world</p>

<p>Since lowly feigning was called compliment.</p>

<p>You’re servant to the Count Orsino, youth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>And he is yours, and his must needs be yours.</p>

<p>Your servant’s servant is your servant, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>For him, I think not on him. For his thoughts,</p>

<p>Would they were blanks rather than filled with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts</p>

<p>On his behalf.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  O, by your leave, I pray you.</p>

<p>I bade you never speak again of him.</p>

<p>But would you undertake another suit,</p>

<p>I had rather hear you to solicit that</p>

<p>Than music from the spheres.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Dear lady–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,</p>

<p>After the last enchantment you did here,</p>

<p>A ring in chase of you. So did I abuse</p>

<p>Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you.</p>

<p>Under your hard construction must I sit,</p>

<p>To force that on you in a shameful cunning</p>

<p>Which you knew none of yours. What might you</p>

<p>think?</p>

<p>Have you not set mine honor at the stake</p>

<p>And baited it with all th’ unmuzzled thoughts</p>

<p>That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your</p>

<p>receiving</p>

<p>Enough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom,</p>

<p>Hides my heart. So, let me hear you speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>I pity you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  That’s a degree to love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>No, not a grize, for ’tis a vulgar proof</p>

<p>That very oft we pity enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>Why then methinks ’tis time to smile again.</p>

<p>O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!</p>

<p>If one should be a prey, how much the better</p>

<p>To fall before the lion than the wolf.     <i><i>[Clock strikes.]</i></i></p>

<p>The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.</p>

<p>Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you.</p>

<p>And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest,</p>

<p>Your wife is like to reap a proper man.</p>

<p>There lies your way, due west.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Then westward ho!</p>

<p>Grace and good disposition attend your Ladyship.</p>

<p>You’ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>Stay. I prithee, tell me what thou think’st of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>That you do think you are not what you are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>If I think so, I think the same of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>Then think you right. I am not what I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>I would you were as I would have you be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>Would it be better, madam, than I am?</p>

<p>I wish it might, for now I am your fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful</p>

<p>In the contempt and anger of his lip!</p>

<p>A murd’rous guilt shows not itself more soon</p>

<p>Than love that would seem hid. Love’s night is</p>

<p>noon.–</p>

<p>Cesario, by the roses of the spring,</p>

<p>By maidhood, honor, truth, and everything,</p>

<p>I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,</p>

<p>Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.</p>

<p>Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,</p>

<p>For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;</p>

<p>But rather reason thus with reason fetter:</p>

<p>Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>By innocence I swear, and by my youth,</p>

<p>I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,</p>

<p>And that no woman has, nor never none</p>

<p>Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.</p>

<p>And so adieu, good madam. Nevermore</p>

<p>Will I my master’s tears to you deplore.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move</p>

<p>That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.</p>
