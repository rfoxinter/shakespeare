<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Toby and Maria.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  What a plague means my niece to take the death</p>

<p>of her brother thus? I am sure care’s an enemy to</p>

<p>life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier</p>

<p>o’ nights. Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions</p>

<p>to your ill hours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Why, let her except before excepted!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Ay, but you must confine yourself within the</p>

<p>modest limits of order.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Confine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am.</p>

<p>These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so</p>

<p>be these boots too. An they be not, let them hang</p>

<p>themselves in their own straps!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  That quaffing and drinking will undo you. I</p>

<p>heard my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish</p>

<p>knight that you brought in one night here to be her</p>

<p>wooer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Ay, he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  He’s as tall a man as any ’s in Illyria.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  What’s that to th’ purpose?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Why, he has three thousand ducats a year!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats.</p>

<p>He’s a very fool and a prodigal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Fie that you’ll say so! He plays o’ th’ viol-de-gamboys</p>

<p>and speaks three or four languages word</p>

<p>for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of</p>

<p>nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  He hath indeed, almost natural, for, besides</p>

<p>that he’s a fool, he’s a great quarreler, and, but that</p>

<p>he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath</p>

<p>in quarreling, ’tis thought among the prudent he</p>

<p>would quickly have the gift of a grave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors</p>

<p>that say so of him. Who are they?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in</p>

<p>your company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  With drinking healths to my niece. I’ll drink to</p>

<p>her as long as there is a passage in my throat and</p>

<p>drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a coistrel that</p>

<p>will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ th’</p>

<p>toe like a parish top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo,</p>

<p>for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Andrew.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Sweet Sir Andrew!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> <i>[to Maria]</i>  Bless you, fair shrew.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  And you too, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Accost, Sir Andrew, accost!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  What’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  My niece’s chambermaid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Good Mistress Accost, I desire better</p>

<p>acquaintance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  My name is Mary, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Good Mistress Mary Accost–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  You mistake, knight. “Accost” is front her, board</p>

<p>her, woo her, assail her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  By my troth, I would not undertake her in</p>

<p>this company. Is that the meaning of “accost”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Fare you well, gentlemen.     <i><i>[She begins to exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou</p>

<p>mightst never draw sword again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  An you part so, mistress, I would I might</p>

<p>never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you</p>

<p>have fools in hand?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Sir, I have not you by th’ hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Marry, but you shall have, and here’s my</p>

<p>hand.     <i><i>[He offers his hand.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span> <i>[taking his hand]</i>  Now sir, thought is free. I</p>

<p>pray you, bring your hand to th’ butt’ry bar and let</p>

<p>it drink.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Wherefore, sweetheart? What’s your</p>

<p>metaphor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  It’s dry, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Why, I think so. I am not such an ass but I</p>

<p>can keep my hand dry. But what’s your jest?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  A dry jest, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Are you full of them?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers’ ends. Marry,</p>

<p>now I let go your hand, I am barren.     <i><i>[Maria exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  O knight, thou lack’st a cup of canary! When did</p>

<p>I see thee so put down?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Never in your life, I think, unless you see</p>

<p>canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have</p>

<p>no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man</p>

<p>has. But I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that</p>

<p>does harm to my wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  No question.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  An I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride</p>

<p>home tomorrow, Sir Toby.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Pourquoi, my dear knight?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  What is “pourquoi”? Do, or not do? I would I</p>

<p>had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in</p>

<p>fencing, dancing, and bearbaiting. O, had I but</p>

<p>followed the arts!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Why, would that have mended my hair?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by</p>

<p>nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  But it becomes me well enough, does ’t not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Excellent! It hangs like flax on a distaff, and I</p>

<p>hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs</p>

<p>and spin it off.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your</p>

<p>niece will not be seen, or if she be, it’s four to one</p>

<p>she’ll none of me. The Count himself here hard by</p>

<p>woos her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  She’ll none o’ th’ Count. She’ll not match above</p>

<p>her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit. I have</p>

<p>heard her swear ’t. Tut, there’s life in ’t, man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  I’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ th’</p>

<p>strangest mind i’ th’ world. I delight in masques</p>

<p>and revels sometimes altogether.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be,</p>

<p>under the degree of my betters, and yet I will not</p>

<p>compare with an old man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Faith, I can cut a caper.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  And I can cut the mutton to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  And I think I have the back-trick simply as</p>

<p>strong as any man in Illyria.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have</p>

<p>these gifts a curtain before ’em? Are they like to</p>

<p>take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture? Why dost</p>

<p>thou not go to church in a galliard and come home</p>

<p>in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig. I would</p>

<p>not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace.</p>

<p>What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues</p>

<p>in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy</p>

<p>leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Ay, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a</p>

<p>dun-colored stock. Shall we set about some</p>

<p>revels?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  What shall we do else? Were we not born under</p>

<p>Taurus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Taurus? That’s sides and heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee</p>

<p>caper. <i>[Sir Andrew dances.]</i> Ha, higher! Ha, ha,</p>

<p>excellent!</p>
