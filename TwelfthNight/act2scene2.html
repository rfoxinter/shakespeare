<p><center><i>[Enter Viola and Malvolio, at several doors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Malvolio</sc>  Were not you even now with the Countess</p>

<p>Olivia?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  Even now, sir. On a moderate pace I have since</p>

<p>arrived but hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Malvolio</sc>  She returns this ring to you, sir. You might</p>

<p>have saved me my pains to have taken it away</p>

<p>yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put</p>

<p>your lord into a desperate assurance she will none</p>

<p>of him. And one thing more, that you be never so</p>

<p>hardy to come again in his affairs unless it be to</p>

<p>report your lord’s taking of this. Receive it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc>  She took the ring of me. I’ll none of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Malvolio</sc>  Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and</p>

<p>her will is it should be so returned. <i>[He throws</p>

<p>down the ring.]</i> If it be worth stooping for, there it</p>

<p>lies in your eye; if not, be it his that finds it.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Viola</sc></p>

<p>I left no ring with her. What means this lady?</p>

<p><center><i>[She picks up the ring.]</i></center></p>

<p>Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her!</p>

<p>She made good view of me, indeed so much</p>

<p>That methought her eyes had lost her tongue,</p>

<p>For she did speak in starts distractedly.</p>

<p>She loves me, sure! The cunning of her passion</p>

<p>Invites me in this churlish messenger.</p>

<p>None of my lord’s ring? Why, he sent her none!</p>

<p>I am the man. If it be so, as ’tis,</p>

<p>Poor lady, she were better love a dream.</p>

<p>Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness</p>

<p>Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.</p>

<p>How easy is it for the proper false</p>

<p>In women’s waxen hearts to set their forms!</p>

<p>Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we,</p>

<p>For such as we are made of, such we be.</p>

<p>How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,</p>

<p>And I, poor monster, fond as much on him,</p>

<p>And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.</p>

<p>What will become of this? As I am man,</p>

<p>My state is desperate for my master’s love.</p>

<p>As I am woman (now, alas the day!),</p>

<p>What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!</p>

<p>O Time, thou must untangle this, not I.</p>

<p>It is too hard a knot for me t’ untie.</p>
