<p><center><i>[Enter Olivia and Maria.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I have sent after him. He says he’ll come.</p>

<p>How shall I feast him? What bestow of him?</p>

<p>For youth is bought more oft than begged or</p>

<p>borrowed.</p>

<p>I speak too loud.–</p>

<p>Where’s Malvolio? He is sad and civil</p>

<p>And suits well for a servant with my fortunes.</p>

<p>Where is Malvolio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  He’s coming, madam, but in very strange manner.</p>

<p>He is sure possessed, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Why, what’s the matter? Does he rave?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  No, madam, he does nothing but smile. Your</p>

<p>Ladyship were best to have some guard about you if</p>

<p>he come, for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>Go call him hither. <i>[Maria exits.]</i> I am as mad as he,</p>

<p>If sad and merry madness equal be.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Maria with Malvolio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Malvolio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Sweet lady, ho, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Smil’st thou? I sent for thee upon a sad</p>

<p>occasion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Sad, lady? I could be sad. This does make</p>

<p>some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering,</p>

<p>but what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is</p>

<p>with me as the very true sonnet is: “Please one, and</p>

<p>please all.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter</p>

<p>with thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Not black in my mind, though yellow in my</p>

<p>legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall</p>

<p>be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman</p>

<p>hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  To bed? “Ay, sweetheart, and I’ll come to</p>

<p>thee.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and</p>

<p>kiss thy hand so oft?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  How do you, Malvolio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  At your request? Yes, nightingales answer</p>

<p>daws!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness</p>

<p>before my lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “Be not afraid of greatness.” ’Twas well</p>

<p>writ.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  What mean’st thou by that, Malvolio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “Some are born great–”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “Some achieve greatness–”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  What sayst thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “And some have greatness thrust upon</p>

<p>them.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Heaven restore thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “Remember who commended thy yellow</p>

<p>stockings–”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Thy yellow stockings?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “And wished to see thee cross-gartered.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Cross-gartered?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “Go to, thou art made, if thou desir’st to be</p>

<p>so–”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Am I made?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  “If not, let me see thee a servant still.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  Why, this is very midsummer madness!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span>  Madam, the young gentleman of the Count</p>

<p>Orsino’s is returned. I could hardly entreat him</p>

<p>back. He attends your Ladyship’s pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span>  I’ll come to him. <i>[Servant exits.]</i> Good Maria, let</p>

<p>this fellow be looked to. Where’s my Cousin Toby?</p>

<p>Let some of my people have a special care of him. I</p>

<p>would not have him miscarry for the half of my</p>

<p>dowry.</p>

<p><center><i>[Olivia and Maria exit in different directions.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  O ho, do you come near me now? No worse</p>

<p>man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs</p>

<p>directly with the letter. She sends him on purpose</p>

<p>that I may appear stubborn to him, for she incites</p>

<p>me to that in the letter: “Cast thy humble slough,”</p>

<p>says she. “Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with</p>

<p>servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of</p>

<p>state; put thyself into the trick of singularity,” and</p>

<p>consequently sets down the manner how: as, a sad</p>

<p>face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit</p>

<p>of some Sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her,</p>

<p>but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful!</p>

<p>And when she went away now, “Let this fellow be</p>

<p>looked to.” “Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” nor after my</p>

<p>degree, but “fellow.” Why, everything adheres together,</p>

<p>that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a</p>

<p>scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe</p>

<p>circumstance–what can be said? Nothing that can</p>

<p>be can come between me and the full prospect of</p>

<p>my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and</p>

<p>he is to be thanked.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Toby, Fabian, and Maria.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all</p>

<p>the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion</p>

<p>himself possessed him, yet I’ll speak to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Here he is, here he is.–How is ’t with you, sir?</p>

<p>How is ’t with you, man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Go off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my</p>

<p>private. Go off.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span> <i>[to Toby]</i>  Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks</p>

<p>within him! Did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady</p>

<p>prays you to have a care of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Aha, does she so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[to Fabian and Maria]</i>  Go to, go to! Peace, peace.</p>

<p>We must deal gently with him. Let me alone.–How</p>

<p>do you, Malvolio? How is ’t with you? What, man,</p>

<p>defy the devil! Consider, he’s an enemy to mankind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Do you know what you say?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span> <i>[to Toby]</i>  La you, an you speak ill of the devil,</p>

<p>how he takes it at heart! Pray God he be not</p>

<p>bewitched!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Carry his water to th’ wisewoman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning</p>

<p>if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than</p>

<p>I’ll say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  How now, mistress?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  O Lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Prithee, hold thy peace. This is not the way. Do</p>

<p>you not see you move him? Let me alone with</p>

<p>him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  No way but gentleness, gently, gently. The</p>

<p>fiend is rough and will not be roughly used.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[to Malvolio]</i>  Why, how now, my bawcock? How</p>

<p>dost thou, chuck?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Sir!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Ay, biddy, come with me.–What, man, ’tis not</p>

<p>for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan. Hang</p>

<p>him, foul collier!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby; get</p>

<p>him to pray.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  My prayers, minx?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span> <i>[to Toby]</i>  No, I warrant you, he will not hear of</p>

<p>godliness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malvolio</span>  Go hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow</p>

<p>things. I am not of your element. You shall</p>

<p>know more hereafter.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Is ’t possible?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  If this were played upon a stage now, I could</p>

<p>condemn it as an improbable fiction.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  His very genius hath taken the infection of the</p>

<p>device, man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air</p>

<p>and taint.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Why, we shall make him mad indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  The house will be the quieter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Come, we’ll have him in a dark room and</p>

<p>bound. My niece is already in the belief that he’s</p>

<p>mad. We may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his</p>

<p>penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath,</p>

<p>prompt us to have mercy on him, at which time we</p>

<p>will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a</p>

<p>finder of madmen. But see, but see!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Andrew.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  More matter for a May morning.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> <i>[presenting a paper]</i>  Here’s the challenge.</p>

<p>Read it. I warrant there’s vinegar and pepper in ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Is ’t so saucy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Ay, is ’t. I warrant him. Do but read.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Give me. <i>[He reads.]</i> Youth, whatsoever thou art,</p>

<p>thou art but a scurvy fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Good, and valiant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[reads]</i>  Wonder not nor admire not in thy mind</p>

<p>why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason</p>

<p>for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  A good note, that keeps you from the blow of</p>

<p>the law.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[reads]</i>  Thou com’st to the Lady Olivia, and in my</p>

<p>sight she uses thee kindly. But thou liest in thy throat;</p>

<p>that is not the matter I challenge thee for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Very brief, and to exceeding good sense–less.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[reads]</i>  I will waylay thee going home, where if it be</p>

<p>thy chance to kill me–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[reads]</i>  Thou kill’st me like a rogue and a villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Still you keep o’ th’ windy side of the law.</p>

<p>Good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[reads]</i>  Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon</p>

<p>one of our souls. He may have mercy upon mine, but</p>

<p>my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as</p>

<p>thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,</p>

<p>Andrew Aguecheek.</p>

<p>If this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I’ll</p>

<p>give ’t him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  You may have very fit occasion for ’t. He is now</p>

<p>in some commerce with my lady and will by and</p>

<p>by depart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Go, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner</p>

<p>of the orchard like a bum-baily. So soon as ever</p>

<p>thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw’st, swear</p>

<p>horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath,</p>

<p>with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives</p>

<p>manhood more approbation than ever proof itself</p>

<p>would have earned him. Away!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Nay, let me alone for swearing.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Now will not I deliver his letter, for the behavior</p>

<p>of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good</p>

<p>capacity and breeding; his employment between</p>

<p>his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore,</p>

<p>this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed</p>

<p>no terror in the youth. He will find it comes from a</p>

<p>clodpoll. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by</p>

<p>word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable</p>

<p>report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know</p>

<p>his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous</p>

<p>opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This</p>

<p>will so fright them both that they will kill one</p>

<p>another by the look, like cockatrices.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Olivia and Viola.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Here he comes with your niece. Give them</p>

<p>way till he take leave, and presently after him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  I will meditate the while upon some horrid</p>

<p>message for a challenge.</p>

<p><center><i>[Toby, Fabian, and Maria exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>I have said too much unto a heart of stone</p>

<p>And laid mine honor too unchary on ’t.</p>

<p>There’s something in me that reproves my fault,</p>

<p>But such a headstrong potent fault it is</p>

<p>That it but mocks reproof.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>With the same ’havior that your passion bears</p>

<p>Goes on my master’s griefs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>Here, wear this jewel for me. ’Tis my picture.</p>

<p>Refuse it not. It hath no tongue to vex you.</p>

<p>And I beseech you come again tomorrow.</p>

<p>What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny,</p>

<p>That honor, saved, may upon asking give?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span></p>

<p>Nothing but this: your true love for my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>How with mine honor may I give him that</p>

<p>Which I have given to you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I will acquit you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Olivia</span></p>

<p>Well, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well.</p>

<p>A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Toby and Fabian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Gentleman, God save thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  And you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  That defense thou hast, betake thee to ’t. Of what</p>

<p>nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know</p>

<p>not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as</p>

<p>the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount</p>

<p>thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy</p>

<p>assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  You mistake, sir. I am sure no man hath any</p>

<p>quarrel to me. My remembrance is very free and</p>

<p>clear from any image of offense done to any man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore,</p>

<p>if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your</p>

<p>guard, for your opposite hath in him what youth,</p>

<p>strength, skill, and wrath can furnish man withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I pray you, sir, what is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and</p>

<p>on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private</p>

<p>brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and</p>

<p>his incensement at this moment is so implacable</p>

<p>that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death</p>

<p>and sepulcher. “Hob, nob” is his word; “give ’t or</p>

<p>take ’t.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I will return again into the house and desire</p>

<p>some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have</p>

<p>heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely</p>

<p>on others to taste their valor. Belike this is a</p>

<p>man of that quirk.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Sir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very</p>

<p>competent injury. Therefore get you on and give</p>

<p>him his desire. Back you shall not to the house,</p>

<p>unless you undertake that with me which with as</p>

<p>much safety you might answer him. Therefore on,</p>

<p>or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you</p>

<p>must, that’s certain, or forswear to wear iron about</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do</p>

<p>me this courteous office, as to know of the knight</p>

<p>what my offense to him is. It is something of my</p>

<p>negligence, nothing of my purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  I will do so.–Signior Fabian, stay you by this</p>

<p>gentleman till my return.     <i><i>[Toby exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  I know the knight is incensed against you even</p>

<p>to a mortal arbitrament, but nothing of the circumstance</p>

<p>more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I beseech you, what manner of man is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read</p>

<p>him by his form, as you are like to find him in the</p>

<p>proof of his valor. He is indeed, sir, the most skillful,</p>

<p>bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly</p>

<p>have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk</p>

<p>towards him? I will make your peace with him if I</p>

<p>can.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I shall be much bound to you for ’t. I am one</p>

<p>that had rather go with Sir Priest than Sir Knight, I</p>

<p>care not who knows so much of my mettle.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Toby and Andrew.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Why, man, he’s a very devil. I have not seen such</p>

<p>a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard,</p>

<p>and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such</p>

<p>a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the</p>

<p>answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hits the</p>

<p>ground they step on. They say he has been fencer</p>

<p>to the Sophy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Pox on ’t! I’ll not meddle with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Ay, but he will not now be pacified. Fabian can</p>

<p>scarce hold him yonder.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Plague on ’t! An I thought he had been</p>

<p>valiant, and so cunning in fence, I’d have seen him</p>

<p>damned ere I’d have challenged him. Let him let</p>

<p>the matter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, gray</p>

<p>Capilet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  I’ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good</p>

<p>show on ’t. This shall end without the perdition of</p>

<p>souls. <i>[Aside.]</i> Marry, I’ll ride your horse as well as I</p>

<p>ride you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fabian and Viola.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Toby crosses to meet them.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[Aside to Fabian.]</i> I have his horse to take up the</p>

<p>quarrel. I have persuaded him the youth’s a devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span> <i>[aside to Toby]</i>  He is as horribly conceited of</p>

<p>him, and pants and looks pale as if a bear were at his</p>

<p>heels.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[to Viola]</i>  There’s no remedy, sir; he will fight</p>

<p>with you for ’s oath sake. Marry, he hath better</p>

<p>bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now</p>

<p>scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for</p>

<p>the supportance of his vow. He protests he will not</p>

<p>hurt you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  Pray God defend me! <i>[Aside.]</i> A little thing</p>

<p>would make me tell them how much I lack of a</p>

<p>man.</p>

<p><center><i>[Toby crosses to Andrew.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Come, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy. The</p>

<p>gentleman will, for his honor’s sake, have one bout</p>

<p>with you. He cannot by the duello avoid it. But he</p>

<p>has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier,</p>

<p>he will not hurt you. Come on, to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> <i>[drawing his sword]</i>  Pray God he keep his</p>

<p>oath!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span> <i>[drawing her sword]</i></p>

<p>I do assure you ’tis against my will.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antonio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span> <i>[to Andrew]</i></p>

<p>Put up your sword. If this young gentleman</p>

<p>Have done offense, I take the fault on me.</p>

<p>If you offend him, I for him defy you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  You, sir? Why, what are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span> <i>[drawing his sword]</i></p>

<p>One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more</p>

<p>Than you have heard him brag to you he will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[drawing his sword]</i></p>

<p>Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Officers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  O, good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span> <i>[to Antonio]</i>  I’ll be with you anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span> <i>[to Andrew]</i>  Pray, sir, put your sword up, if</p>

<p>you please.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  Marry, will I, sir. And for that I promised</p>

<p>you, I’ll be as good as my word. He will bear you</p>

<p>easily, and reins well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span>  This is the man. Do thy office.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span>  Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of</p>

<p>Count Orsino.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  You do mistake me, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span></p>

<p>No, sir, no jot. I know your favor well,</p>

<p>Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.–</p>

<p>Take him away. He knows I know him well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>I must obey. <i>[To Viola.]</i> This comes with seeking</p>

<p>you.</p>

<p>But there’s no remedy. I shall answer it.</p>

<p>What will you do, now my necessity</p>

<p>Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me</p>

<p>Much more for what I cannot do for you</p>

<p>Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed,</p>

<p>But be of comfort.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span>  Come, sir, away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span> <i>[to Viola]</i></p>

<p>I must entreat of you some of that money.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  What money, sir?</p>

<p>For the fair kindness you have showed me here,</p>

<p>And part being prompted by your present trouble,</p>

<p>Out of my lean and low ability</p>

<p>I’ll lend you something. My having is not much.</p>

<p>I’ll make division of my present with you.</p>

<p>Hold, there’s half my coffer.     <i><i>[Offering him money.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Will you deny me now?</p>

<p>Is ’t possible that my deserts to you</p>

<p>Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,</p>

<p>Lest that it make me so unsound a man</p>

<p>As to upbraid you with those kindnesses</p>

<p>That I have done for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span>  I know of none,</p>

<p>Nor know I you by voice or any feature.</p>

<p>I hate ingratitude more in a man</p>

<p>Than lying, vainness, babbling drunkenness,</p>

<p>Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption</p>

<p>Inhabits our frail blood–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  O heavens themselves!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span>  Come, sir, I pray you go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here</p>

<p>I snatched one half out of the jaws of death,</p>

<p>Relieved him with such sanctity of love,</p>

<p>And to his image, which methought did promise</p>

<p>Most venerable worth, did I devotion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span></p>

<p>What’s that to us? The time goes by. Away!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>But O, how vile an idol proves this god!</p>

<p>Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.</p>

<p>In nature there’s no blemish but the mind;</p>

<p>None can be called deformed but the unkind.</p>

<p>Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil</p>

<p>Are empty trunks o’erflourished by the devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span></p>

<p>The man grows mad. Away with him.–Come,</p>

<p>come, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Lead me on.</p>

<p><center><i>[Antonio and Officers exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Methinks his words do from such passion fly</p>

<p>That he believes himself; so do not I.</p>

<p>Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,</p>

<p>That I, dear brother, be now ta’en for you!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian. We’ll</p>

<p>whisper o’er a couplet or two of most sage saws.</p>

<p><center><i>[Toby, Fabian, and Andrew move aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Viola</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>He named Sebastian. I my brother know</p>

<p>Yet living in my glass. Even such and so</p>

<p>In favor was my brother, and he went</p>

<p>Still in this fashion, color, ornament,</p>

<p>For him I imitate. O, if it prove,</p>

<p>Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  A very dishonest, paltry boy, and more a coward</p>

<p>than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his</p>

<p>friend here in necessity and denying him; and for</p>

<p>his cowardship, ask Fabian.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  A coward, a most devout coward, religious</p>

<p>in it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  ’Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy</p>

<p>sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>  An I do not–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fabian</span>  Come, let’s see the event.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Toby</span>  I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet.</p>
