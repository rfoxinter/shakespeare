<p><center><i>[Enter Falstaff and Bardolph.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry. Fill</p>

<p>me a bottle of sack. Our soldiers shall march</p>

<p>through. We’ll to Sutton Coldfield tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Will you give me money, captain?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Lay out, lay out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  This bottle makes an angel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  An if it do, take it for thy labor. An if it make</p>

<p>twenty, take them all. I’ll answer the coinage. Bid</p>

<p>my lieutenant Peto meet me at town’s end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  I will, captain. Farewell.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a</p>

<p>soused gurnet. I have misused the King’s press</p>

<p>damnably. I have got, in exchange of a hundred</p>

<p>and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I</p>

<p>press me none but good householders, yeomen’s</p>

<p>sons, inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as</p>

<p>had been asked twice on the banns–such a commodity</p>

<p>of warm slaves as had as lief hear the devil</p>

<p>as a drum, such as fear the report of a caliver worse</p>

<p>than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. I pressed me</p>

<p>none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their</p>

<p>bellies no bigger than pins’ heads, and they have</p>

<p>bought out their services, and now my whole</p>

<p>charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants,</p>

<p>gentlemen of companies–slaves as ragged as Lazarus</p>

<p>in the painted cloth, where the glutton’s dogs</p>

<p>licked his sores; and such as indeed were never</p>

<p>soldiers, but discarded, unjust servingmen, younger</p>

<p>sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters, and</p>

<p>ostlers tradefallen, the cankers of a calm world and</p>

<p>a long peace, ten times more dishonorable-ragged</p>

<p>than an old feazed ancient; and such have I to fill up</p>

<p>the rooms of them as have bought out their services,</p>

<p>that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty</p>

<p>tattered prodigals lately come from swine-keeping,</p>

<p>from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me</p>

<p>on the way and told me I had unloaded all the</p>

<p>gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye hath</p>

<p>seen such scarecrows. I’ll not march through Coventry</p>

<p>with them, that’s flat. Nay, and the villains</p>

<p>march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on,</p>

<p>for indeed I had the most of them out of prison.</p>

<p>There’s not a shirt and a half in all my company,</p>

<p>and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together</p>

<p>and thrown over the shoulders like a herald’s coat</p>

<p>without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth,</p>

<p>stolen from my host at Saint Albans or the red-nose</p>

<p>innkeeper of Daventry. But that’s all one; they’ll find</p>

<p>linen enough on every hedge.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Prince and the Lord of Westmoreland.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  How now, blown Jack? How now, quilt?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  What, Hal, how now, mad wag? What a devil</p>

<p>dost thou in Warwickshire?–My good Lord of</p>

<p>Westmoreland, I cry you mercy. I thought your</p>

<p>Honor had already been at Shrewsbury.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span>  Faith, Sir John, ’tis more than time</p>

<p>that I were there and you too, but my powers are</p>

<p>there already. The King, I can tell you, looks for us</p>

<p>all. We must away all night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Tut, never fear me. I am as vigilant as a cat to</p>

<p>steal cream.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  I think to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath</p>

<p>already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose</p>

<p>fellows are these that come after?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Mine, Hal, mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  I did never see such pitiful rascals.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Tut, tut, good enough to toss; food for powder,</p>

<p>food for powder. They’ll fill a pit as well as</p>

<p>better. Tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span>  Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are</p>

<p>exceeding poor and bare, too beggarly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Faith, for their poverty, I know not where</p>

<p>they had that, and for their bareness, I am sure they</p>

<p>never learned that of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  No, I’ll be sworn, unless you call three fingers</p>

<p>in the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste. Percy is</p>

<p>already in the field.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  What, is the King encamped?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span>  He is, Sir John. I fear we shall stay too</p>

<p>long.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Well,</p>

<p>To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a</p>

<p>feast</p>

<p>Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.</p>
