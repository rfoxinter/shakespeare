<p><center><i>[Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  Heigh-ho! An it be not four by the day,</p>

<p>I’ll be hanged. Charles’s Wain is over the new</p>

<p>chimney, and yet our horse not packed.–What,</p>

<p>ostler!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ostler</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Anon, anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  I prithee, Tom, beat Cut’s saddle. Put a</p>

<p>few flocks in the point. Poor jade is wrung in the</p>

<p>withers out of all cess.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter another Carrier, with a lantern.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  Peas and beans are as dank here as a</p>

<p>dog, and that is the next way to give poor jades the</p>

<p>bots. This house is turned upside down since Robin</p>

<p>ostler died.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  Poor fellow never joyed since the price</p>

<p>of oats rose. It was the death of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  I think this be the most villainous</p>

<p>house in all London road for fleas. I am stung like a</p>

<p>tench.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  Like a tench? By the Mass, there is</p>

<p>ne’er a king christen could be better bit than I have</p>

<p>been since the first cock.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  Why, they will allow us ne’er a jordan,</p>

<p>and then we leak in your chimney, and your</p>

<p>chamber-lye breeds fleas like a loach.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  What, ostler, come away and be</p>

<p>hanged. Come away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  I have a gammon of bacon and two</p>

<p>races of ginger to be delivered as far as Charing</p>

<p>Cross.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  God’s body, the turkeys in my pannier</p>

<p>are quite starved.–What, ostler! A plague on thee!</p>

<p>Hast thou never an eye in thy head? Canst not hear?</p>

<p>An ’twere not as good deed as drink to break the</p>

<p>pate on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be</p>

<p>hanged. Hast no faith in thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gadshill.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gadshill</sc>  Good morrow, carriers. What’s o’clock?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  I think it be two o’clock.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gadshill</sc>  I prithee, lend me thy lantern to see my</p>

<p>gelding in the stable.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  Nay, by God, soft. I know a trick worth</p>

<p>two of that, i’ faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gadshill</sc> <i>[to Second Carrier]</i>  I pray thee, lend me</p>

<p>thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  Ay, when, canst tell? “Lend me thy</p>

<p>lantern,” quoth he. Marry, I’ll see thee hanged</p>

<p>first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gadshill</sc>  Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to</p>

<p>come to London?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Carrier</sc>  Time enough to go to bed with a</p>

<p>candle, I warrant thee. Come, neighbor Mugs,</p>

<p>we’ll call up the gentlemen. They will along with</p>

<p>company, for they have great charge.</p>

<p><center><i>[Carriers exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gadshill</sc>  What ho, chamberlain!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Chamberlain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  At hand, quoth pickpurse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gadshill</sc>  That’s even as fair as “at hand, quoth the</p>

<p>Chamberlain,” for thou variest no more from</p>

<p>picking of purses than giving direction doth from</p>

<p>laboring: thou layest the plot how.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds</p>

<p>current that I told you yesternight: there’s a franklin</p>

<p>in the Wild of Kent hath brought three hundred</p>

<p>marks with him in gold. I heard him tell it to one of</p>

<p>his company last night at supper–a kind of auditor,</p>

<p>one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows</p>

<p>what. They are up already and call for eggs and</p>

<p>butter. They will away presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gadshill</sc>  Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas’</p>

<p>clerks, I’ll give thee this neck.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  No, I’ll none of it. I pray thee, keep that</p>

<p>for the hangman, for I know thou worshipest Saint</p>

<p>Nicholas as truly as a man of falsehood may.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gadshill</sc>  What talkest thou to me of the hangman? If</p>

<p>I hang, I’ll make a fat pair of gallows, for if I hang,</p>

<p>old Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is</p>

<p>no starveling. Tut, there are other Troyans that</p>

<p>thou dream’st not of, the which for sport sake are</p>

<p>content to do the profession some grace, that</p>

<p>would, if matters should be looked into, for their</p>

<p>own credit sake make all whole. I am joined with no</p>

<p>foot-land-rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,</p>

<p>none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms,</p>

<p>but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters</p>

<p>and great oneyers, such as can hold in, such</p>

<p>as will strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner</p>

<p>than drink, and drink sooner than pray, and yet,</p>

<p>zounds, I lie, for they pray continually to their saint</p>

<p>the commonwealth, or rather not pray to her but</p>

<p>prey on her, for they ride up and down on her and</p>

<p>make her their boots.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  What, the commonwealth their boots?</p>

<p>Will she hold out water in foul way?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gadshill</sc>  She will, she will. Justice hath liquored her.</p>

<p>We steal as in a castle, cocksure. We have the</p>

<p>receipt of fern seed; we walk invisible.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  Nay, by my faith, I think you are more</p>

<p>beholding to the night than to fern seed for your</p>

<p>walking invisible.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gadshill</sc>  Give me thy hand. Thou shalt have a share in</p>

<p>our purchase, as I am a true man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  Nay, rather let me have it as you are a</p>

<p>false thief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gadshill</sc>  Go to. Homo is a common name to all men.</p>

<p>Bid the ostler bring my gelding out of the stable.</p>

<p>Farewell, you muddy knave.</p>
