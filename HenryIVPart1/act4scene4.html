<p><center><i>[Enter Archbishop of York and Sir Michael.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span> <i>[handing papers]</i></p>

<p>Hie, good Sir Michael, bear this sealed brief</p>

<p>With winged haste to the Lord Marshal,</p>

<p>This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest</p>

<p>To whom they are directed. If you knew</p>

<p>How much they do import, you would make haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sir</span> <span class='sc'>Michael</span></p>

<p>My good lord, I guess their tenor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span>  Like enough you do.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, good Sir Michael, is a day</p>

<p>Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men</p>

<p>Must bide the touch. For, sir, at Shrewsbury,</p>

<p>As I am truly given to understand,</p>

<p>The King with mighty and quick-raised power</p>

<p>Meets with Lord Harry. And I fear, Sir Michael,</p>

<p>What with the sickness of Northumberland,</p>

<p>Whose power was in the first proportion,</p>

<p>And what with Owen Glendower’s absence thence,</p>

<p>Who with them was a rated sinew too</p>

<p>And comes not in, o’erruled by prophecies,</p>

<p>I fear the power of Percy is too weak</p>

<p>To wage an instant trial with the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sir</span> <span class='sc'>Michael</span></p>

<p>Why, my good lord, you need not fear.</p>

<p>There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span>  No, Mortimer is not there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sir</span> <span class='sc'>Michael</span></p>

<p>But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,</p>

<p>And there is my Lord of Worcester, and a head</p>

<p>Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>And so there is. But yet the King hath drawn</p>

<p>The special head of all the land together:</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,</p>

<p>The noble Westmoreland, and warlike Blunt,</p>

<p>And many more corrivals and dear men</p>

<p>Of estimation and command in arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sir</span> <span class='sc'>Michael</span></p>

<p>Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>I hope no less, yet needful ’tis to fear;</p>

<p>And to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed.</p>

<p>For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the King</p>

<p>Dismiss his power he means to visit us,</p>

<p>For he hath heard of our confederacy,</p>

<p>And ’tis but wisdom to make strong against him.</p>

<p>Therefore make haste. I must go write again</p>

<p>To other friends. And so farewell, Sir Michael.</p>
