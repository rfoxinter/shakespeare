<p><center><i>[Enter Prince and Poins.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room and</p>

<p>lend me thy hand to laugh a little.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Where hast been, Hal?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  With three or four loggerheads amongst three</p>

<p>or fourscore hogsheads. I have sounded the very</p>

<p>bass string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother</p>

<p>to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their</p>

<p>Christian names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They</p>

<p>take it already upon their salvation that though I be</p>

<p>but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy,</p>

<p>and tell me flatly I am no proud jack, like Falstaff,</p>

<p>but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy–by</p>

<p>the Lord, so they call me–and when I am king of</p>

<p>England, I shall command all the good lads in</p>

<p>Eastcheap. They call drinking deep “dyeing scarlet,”</p>

<p>and when you breathe in your watering, they</p>

<p>cry “Hem!” and bid you “Play it off!” To conclude, I</p>

<p>am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour</p>

<p>that I can drink with any tinker in his own language</p>

<p>during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much</p>

<p>honor that thou wert not with me in this action; but,</p>

<p>sweet Ned–to sweeten which name of Ned, I give</p>

<p>thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now</p>

<p>into my hand by an underskinker, one that never</p>

<p>spake other English in his life than “Eight shillings</p>

<p>and sixpence,” and “You are welcome,” with this</p>

<p>shrill addition, “Anon, anon, sir.–Score a pint of</p>

<p>bastard in the Half-moon,” or so. But, Ned, to</p>

<p>drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do</p>

<p>thou stand in some by-room while I question my</p>

<p>puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar, and</p>

<p>do thou never leave calling “Francis,” that his tale</p>

<p>to me may be nothing but “Anon.” Step aside, and</p>

<p>I’ll show thee a precedent.     <i><i>[Poins exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Francis!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Thou art perfect.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Francis!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Francis, the Drawer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  Anon, anon, sir.–Look down into the Pomgarnet,</p>

<p>Ralph.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Come hither, Francis.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  My lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  How long hast thou to serve, Francis?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  Forsooth, five years, and as much as to–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Francis!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  Anon, anon, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Five year! By ’r Lady, a long lease for the</p>

<p>clinking of pewter! But, Francis, darest thou be</p>

<p>so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture,</p>

<p>and show it a fair pair of heels, and run</p>

<p>from it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  O Lord, sir, I’ll be sworn upon all the books</p>

<p>in England, I could find in my heart–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Francis!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  Anon, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  How old art thou, Francis?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  Let me see. About Michaelmas next, I shall</p>

<p>be–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Francis!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  Anon, sir.–Pray, stay a little, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Nay, but hark you, Francis, for the sugar thou</p>

<p>gavest me–’twas a pennyworth, was ’t not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  O Lord, I would it had been two!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I will give thee for it a thousand pound. Ask</p>

<p>me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Francis!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  Anon, anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Anon, Francis? No, Francis. But tomorrow,</p>

<p>Francis; or, Francis, o’ Thursday; or indeed, Francis,</p>

<p>when thou wilt. But, Francis–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  My lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Wilt thou rob this leathern-jerkin, crystal-button,</p>

<p>not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,</p>

<p>smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  O Lord, sir, who do you mean?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Why then, your brown bastard is your only</p>

<p>drink, for look you, Francis, your white canvas</p>

<p>doublet will sully. In Barbary, sir, it cannot come to</p>

<p>so much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  What, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Francis!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Away, you rogue! Dost thou not hear them</p>

<p>call?</p>

<p><center><i>[Here they both call him. The Drawer stands amazed,</p>

<p>not knowing which way to go.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Vintner.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vintner</sc>  What, stand’st thou still and hear’st such a</p>

<p>calling? Look to the guests within. <i>[Francis exits.]</i></p>

<p>My lord, old Sir John with half a dozen more are at</p>

<p>the door. Shall I let them in?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Let them alone awhile, and then open the</p>

<p>door. <i>[Vintner exits.]</i> Poins!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Poins.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Anon, anon, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are</p>

<p>at the door. Shall we be merry?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark you,</p>

<p>what cunning match have you made with this jest</p>

<p>of the drawer. Come, what’s the issue?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I am now of all humors that have showed</p>

<p>themselves humors since the old days of Goodman</p>

<p>Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve</p>

<p>o’clock at midnight.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Francis, in haste.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What’s o’clock, Francis?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  Anon, anon, sir.     <i><i>[Francis exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  That ever this fellow should have fewer words</p>

<p>than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His</p>

<p>industry is upstairs and downstairs, his eloquence</p>

<p>the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy’s</p>

<p>mind, the Hotspur of the north, he that kills me</p>

<p>some six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast,</p>

<p>washes his hands, and says to his wife “Fie upon</p>

<p>this quiet life! I want work.” “O my sweet Harry,”</p>

<p>says she, “how many hast thou killed today?”</p>

<p>“Give my roan horse a drench,” says he, and answers</p>

<p>“Some fourteen,” an hour after. “A trifle, a</p>

<p>trifle.” I prithee, call in Falstaff. I’ll play Percy,</p>

<p>and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer</p>

<p>his wife. “Rivo!” says the drunkard. Call in</p>

<p>Ribs, call in Tallow.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Falstaff, Gadshill, Peto, Bardolph;</p>

<p>and Francis, with wine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou been?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance</p>

<p>too! Marry and amen!–Give me a cup of</p>

<p>sack, boy.–Ere I lead this life long, I’ll sew netherstocks</p>

<p>and mend them, and foot them too. A plague</p>

<p>of all cowards!–Give me a cup of sack, rogue!–Is</p>

<p>there no virtue extant?     <i><i>[He drinketh.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of</p>

<p>butter–pitiful-hearted Titan!–that melted at the</p>

<p>sweet tale of the sun’s? If thou didst, then behold</p>

<p>that compound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[to Francis]</i>  You rogue, here’s lime in this</p>

<p>sack too.–There is nothing but roguery to be</p>

<p>found in villainous man, yet a coward is worse than</p>

<p>a cup of sack with lime in it. A villainous coward! Go</p>

<p>thy ways, old Jack. Die when thou wilt. If manhood,</p>

<p>good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the</p>

<p>Earth, then am I a shotten herring. There lives not</p>

<p>three good men unhanged in England, and one of</p>

<p>them is fat and grows old, God help the while. A bad</p>

<p>world, I say. I would I were a weaver. I could sing</p>

<p>psalms, or anything. A plague of all cowards, I say</p>

<p>still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  How now, woolsack, what mutter you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  A king’s son! If I do not beat thee out of thy</p>

<p>kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy</p>

<p>subjects afore thee like a flock of wild geese, I’ll</p>

<p>never wear hair on my face more. You, Prince of</p>

<p>Wales!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Why, you whoreson round man, what’s the</p>

<p>matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Are not you a coward? Answer me to that–</p>

<p>and Poins there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Zounds, you fat paunch, an you call me coward,</p>

<p>by the Lord, I’ll stab thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I call thee coward? I’ll see thee damned ere</p>

<p>I call thee coward, but I would give a thousand</p>

<p>pound I could run as fast as thou canst. You are</p>

<p>straight enough in the shoulders you care not who</p>

<p>sees your back. Call you that backing of your</p>

<p>friends? A plague upon such backing! Give me them</p>

<p>that will face me.–Give me a cup of sack.–I am a</p>

<p>rogue if I drunk today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  O villain, thy lips are scarce wiped since thou</p>

<p>drunk’st last.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  All is one for that. <i>[(He drinketh.)]</i> A plague of</p>

<p>all cowards, still say I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What’s the matter? There be four of us here</p>

<p>have ta’en a thousand pound this day morning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Where is it, Jack, where is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Where is it? Taken from us it is. A hundred</p>

<p>upon poor four of us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What, a hundred, man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword</p>

<p>with a dozen of them two hours together. I have</p>

<p>’scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through</p>

<p>the doublet, four through the hose, my buckler</p>

<p>cut through and through, my sword hacked like</p>

<p>a handsaw. Ecce signum! I never dealt better since</p>

<p>I was a man. All would not do. A plague of</p>

<p>all cowards! Let them speak. <i>[Pointing to Gadshill,</p>

<p>Bardolph, and Peto.]</i> If they speak more or</p>

<p>less than truth, they are villains, and the sons of</p>

<p>darkness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Speak, sirs, how was it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  We four set upon some dozen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Sixteen at least, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  And bound them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Peto</sc>  No, no, they were not bound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  You rogue, they were bound, every man of</p>

<p>them, or I am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  As we were sharing, some six or seven</p>

<p>fresh men set upon us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  And unbound the rest, and then come in the</p>

<p>other.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What, fought you with them all?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  All? I know not what you call all, but if I</p>

<p>fought not with fifty of them I am a bunch of</p>

<p>radish. If there were not two- or three-and-fifty</p>

<p>upon poor old Jack, then am I no two-legged</p>

<p>creature.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Pray God you have not murdered some of</p>

<p>them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Nay, that’s past praying for. I have peppered</p>

<p>two of them. Two I am sure I have paid, two rogues</p>

<p>in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a</p>

<p>lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou knowest my</p>

<p>old ward. Here I lay, and thus I bore my point. Four</p>

<p>rogues in buckram let drive at me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What, four? Thou said’st but two even now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Four, Hal, I told thee four.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Ay, ay, he said four.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  These four came all afront, and mainly</p>

<p>thrust at me. I made me no more ado, but took all</p>

<p>their seven points in my target, thus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Seven? Why there were but four even now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  In buckram?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Ay, four in buckram suits.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Seven by these hilts, or I am a villain else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[to Poins]</i>  Prithee, let him alone. We shall have</p>

<p>more anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Dost thou hear me, Hal?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These</p>

<p>nine in buckram that I told thee of–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  So, two more already.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Their points being broken–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Down fell their hose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Began to give me ground, but I followed me</p>

<p>close, came in foot and hand, and, with a thought,</p>

<p>seven of the eleven I paid.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  O monstrous! Eleven buckram men grown out</p>

<p>of two!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  But as the devil would have it, three misbegotten</p>

<p>knaves in Kendal green came at my back,</p>

<p>and let drive at me, for it was so dark, Hal, that thou</p>

<p>couldst not see thy hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  These lies are like their father that begets</p>

<p>them, gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why,</p>

<p>thou claybrained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou</p>

<p>whoreson, obscene, greasy tallow-catch–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What, art thou mad? Art thou mad? Is not</p>

<p>the truth the truth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Why, how couldst thou know these men in</p>

<p>Kendal green when it was so dark thou couldst not</p>

<p>see thy hand? Come, tell us your reason. What sayest</p>

<p>thou to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What, upon compulsion? Zounds, an I were</p>

<p>at the strappado or all the racks in the world, I</p>

<p>would not tell you on compulsion. Give you a</p>

<p>reason on compulsion? If reasons were as plentiful</p>

<p>as blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon</p>

<p>compulsion, I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I’ll be no longer guilty of this sin. This sanguine</p>

<p>coward, this bed-presser, this horse-backbreaker,</p>

<p>this huge hill of flesh–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  ’Sblood, you starveling, you elfskin, you</p>

<p>dried neat’s tongue, you bull’s pizzle, you stockfish!</p>

<p>O, for breath to utter what is like thee! You tailor’s</p>

<p>yard, you sheath, you bowcase, you vile standing</p>

<p>tuck–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again, and</p>

<p>when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,</p>

<p>hear me speak but this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Mark, Jack.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  We two saw you four set on four, and bound</p>

<p>them and were masters of their wealth. Mark now</p>

<p>how a plain tale shall put you down. Then did we</p>

<p>two set on you four and, with a word, outfaced you</p>

<p>from your prize, and have it, yea, and can show it</p>

<p>you here in the house. And, Falstaff, you carried</p>

<p>your guts away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity,</p>

<p>and roared for mercy, and still run and roared, as</p>

<p>ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou to hack</p>

<p>thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in</p>

<p>fight! What trick, what device, what starting-hole</p>

<p>canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open</p>

<p>and apparent shame?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Come, let’s hear, Jack. What trick hast thou</p>

<p>now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  By the Lord, I knew you as well as he that</p>

<p>made you. Why, hear you, my masters, was it for</p>

<p>me to kill the heir apparent? Should I turn upon the</p>

<p>true prince? Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as</p>

<p>Hercules, but beware instinct. The lion will not</p>

<p>touch the true prince. Instinct is a great matter.</p>

<p>I was now a coward on instinct. I shall think</p>

<p>the better of myself, and thee, during my life–</p>

<p>I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true prince.</p>

<p>But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the</p>

<p>money.–Hostess, clap to the doors.–Watch tonight,</p>

<p>pray tomorrow. Gallants, lads, boys, hearts</p>

<p>of gold, all the titles of good fellowship come to</p>

<p>you. What, shall we be merry? Shall we have a play</p>

<p>extempore?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Content, and the argument shall be thy running</p>

<p>away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hostess.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  O Jesu, my lord the Prince–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  How now, my lady the hostess, what sayst thou</p>

<p>to me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the</p>

<p>court at door would speak with you. He says he</p>

<p>comes from your father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Give him as much as will make him a royal</p>

<p>man and send him back again to my mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What manner of man is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  An old man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What doth Gravity out of his bed at midnight?</p>

<p>Shall I give him his answer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Prithee do, Jack.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Faith, and I’ll send him packing.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Now, sirs. <i>[To Gadshill.]</i> By ’r Lady, you fought</p>

<p>fair.–So did you, Peto.–So did you, Bardolph.–</p>

<p>You are lions too. You ran away upon instinct. You</p>

<p>will not touch the true prince. No, fie!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Faith, I ran when I saw others run.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff’s</p>

<p>sword so hacked?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Peto</sc>  Why, he hacked it with his dagger and said he</p>

<p>would swear truth out of England but he would</p>

<p>make you believe it was done in fight, and persuaded</p>

<p>us to do the like.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Yea, and to tickle our noses with speargrass</p>

<p>to make them bleed, and then to beslubber our</p>

<p>garments with it, and swear it was the blood of true</p>

<p>men. I did that I did not this seven year before: I</p>

<p>blushed to hear his monstrous devices.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen</p>

<p>years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever</p>

<p>since thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire</p>

<p>and sword on thy side, and yet thou ran’st away.</p>

<p>What instinct hadst thou for it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  My lord, do you see these meteors? Do you</p>

<p>behold these exhalations?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  What think you they portend?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Hot livers and cold purses.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  No. If rightly taken, halter.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Falstaff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes lean Jack. Here comes bare-bone.–</p>

<p>How now, my sweet creature of bombast? How long</p>

<p>is ’t ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  My own knee? When I was about thy years,</p>

<p>Hal, I was not an eagle’s talon in the waist. I could</p>

<p>have crept into any alderman’s thumb-ring. A</p>

<p>plague of sighing and grief! It blows a man up like a</p>

<p>bladder. There’s villainous news abroad. Here was</p>

<p>Sir John Bracy from your father. You must to the</p>

<p>court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the</p>

<p>north, Percy, and he of Wales that gave Amamon the</p>

<p>bastinado, and made Lucifer cuckold, and swore</p>

<p>the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a</p>

<p>Welsh hook–what a plague call you him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Owen Glendower.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Owen, Owen, the same, and his son-in-law</p>

<p>Mortimer, and old Northumberland, and that</p>

<p>sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas, that runs a-horseback</p>

<p>up a hill perpendicular–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  He that rides at high speed, and with his pistol</p>

<p>kills a sparrow flying.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  You have hit it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  So did he never the sparrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him. He</p>

<p>will not run.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Why, what a rascal art thou then to praise him</p>

<p>so for running?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  A-horseback, you cuckoo, but afoot he will</p>

<p>not budge a foot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Yes, Jack, upon instinct.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I grant you, upon instinct. Well, he is there</p>

<p>too, and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps</p>

<p>more. Worcester is stolen away tonight. Thy father’s</p>

<p>beard is turned white with the news. You may buy</p>

<p>land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Why then, it is like if there come a hot June,</p>

<p>and this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads</p>

<p>as they buy hobnails, by the hundreds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  By the Mass, thou sayest true. It is like we</p>

<p>shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,</p>

<p>art not thou horrible afeard? Thou being heir</p>

<p>apparent, could the world pick thee out three such</p>

<p>enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit</p>

<p>Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not</p>

<p>horribly afraid? Doth not thy blood thrill at it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Not a whit, i’ faith. I lack some of thy instinct.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Well, thou wilt be horribly chid tomorrow</p>

<p>when thou comest to thy father. If thou love me,</p>

<p>practice an answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Do thou stand for my father and examine me</p>

<p>upon the particulars of my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Shall I? Content. <i>[He sits down.]</i> This chair</p>

<p>shall be my state, this dagger my scepter, and this</p>

<p>cushion my crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Thy state is taken for a joined stool, thy golden</p>

<p>scepter for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich</p>

<p>crown for a pitiful bald crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of</p>

<p>thee, now shalt thou be moved.–Give me a cup of</p>

<p>sack to make my eyes look red, that it may be</p>

<p>thought I have wept, for I must speak in passion,</p>

<p>and I will do it in King Cambyses’ vein.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[bowing]</i>  Well, here is my leg.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  And here is my speech. <i>[As King.]</i> Stand</p>

<p>aside, nobility.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i’ faith!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[as King]</i></p>

<p>Weep not, sweet queen, for trickling tears are vain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  O the Father, how he holds his countenance!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[as King]</i></p>

<p>For God’s sake, lords, convey my tristful queen,</p>

<p>For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry</p>

<p>players as ever I see.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Peace, good pint-pot. Peace, good tickle-brain.–</p>

<p><i>[As King.]</i> Harry, I do not only marvel</p>

<p>where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou</p>

<p>art accompanied. For though the camomile, the</p>

<p>more it is trodden on, the faster it grows, so youth,</p>

<p>the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears. That</p>

<p>thou art my son I have partly thy mother’s word,</p>

<p>partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villainous</p>

<p>trick of thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy</p>

<p>nether lip that doth warrant me. If then thou be</p>

<p>son to me, here lies the point: why, being son to</p>

<p>me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of</p>

<p>heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A</p>

<p>question not to be asked. Shall the son of England</p>

<p>prove a thief and take purses? A question to be</p>

<p>asked. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast</p>

<p>often heard of, and it is known to many in our land</p>

<p>by the name of pitch. This pitch, as ancient writers</p>

<p>do report, doth defile; so doth the company thou</p>

<p>keepest. For, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in</p>

<p>drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion;</p>

<p>not in words only, but in woes also. And yet there is</p>

<p>a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy</p>

<p>company, but I know not his name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What manner of man, an it like your Majesty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[as King]</i>  A goodly portly man, i’ faith, and a</p>

<p>corpulent; of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye, and a</p>

<p>most noble carriage, and, as I think, his age some</p>

<p>fifty, or, by ’r Lady, inclining to threescore; and now</p>

<p>I remember me, his name is Falstaff. If that man</p>

<p>should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me, for, Harry,</p>

<p>I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be</p>

<p>known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then</p>

<p>peremptorily I speak it: there is virtue in that</p>

<p>Falstaff; him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me</p>

<p>now, thou naughty varlet, tell me where hast thou</p>

<p>been this month?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for</p>

<p>me, and I’ll play my father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[rising]</i>  Depose me? If thou dost it half so</p>

<p>gravely, so majestically, both in word and matter,</p>

<p>hang me up by the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a</p>

<p>poulter’s hare.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[sitting down]</i>  Well, here I am set.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  And here I stand.–Judge, my masters.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[as King]</i>  Now, Harry, whence come you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[as Prince]</i>  My noble lord, from Eastcheap.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[as King]</i>  The complaints I hear of thee are</p>

<p>grievous.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[as Prince]</i>  ’Sblood, my lord, they are false.</p>

<p>–Nay, I’ll tickle you for a young prince, i’ faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[as King]</i>  Swearest thou? Ungracious boy,</p>

<p>henceforth ne’er look on me. Thou art violently</p>

<p>carried away from grace. There is a devil haunts</p>

<p>thee in the likeness of an old fat man. A tun of man</p>

<p>is thy companion. Why dost thou converse with that</p>

<p>trunk of humors, that bolting-hutch of beastliness,</p>

<p>that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard</p>

<p>of sack, that stuffed cloakbag of guts, that roasted</p>

<p>Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that</p>

<p>reverend Vice, that gray iniquity, that father ruffian,</p>

<p>that vanity in years? Wherein is he good, but to taste</p>

<p>sack and drink it? Wherein neat and cleanly but to</p>

<p>carve a capon and eat it? Wherein cunning but in</p>

<p>craft? Wherein crafty but in villainy? Wherein villainous</p>

<p>but in all things? Wherein worthy but in</p>

<p>nothing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[as Prince]</i>  I would your Grace would take</p>

<p>me with you. Whom means your Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[as King]</i>  That villainous abominable misleader</p>

<p>of youth, Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[as Prince]</i>  My lord, the man I know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[as King]</i>  I know thou dost.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[as Prince]</i>  But to say I know more harm in</p>

<p>him than in myself were to say more than I know.</p>

<p>That he is old, the more the pity; his white hairs do</p>

<p>witness it. But that he is, saving your reverence, a</p>

<p>whoremaster, that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar</p>

<p>be a fault, God help the wicked. If to be old and</p>

<p>merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is</p>

<p>damned. If to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh’s</p>

<p>lean kine are to be loved. No, my good lord,</p>

<p>banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins, but for</p>

<p>sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack</p>

<p>Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more</p>

<p>valiant being as he is old Jack Falstaff, banish not</p>

<p>him thy Harry’s company, banish not him thy</p>

<p>Harry’s company. Banish plump Jack, and banish</p>

<p>all the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I do, I will.</p>

<p><center><i>[A loud knocking, and Bardolph, Hostess, and</p>

<p>Francis exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bardolph running.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  O my lord, my lord, the Sheriff with a most</p>

<p>monstrous watch is at the door.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Out, you rogue.–Play out the play. I have</p>

<p>much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Hostess.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  O Jesu, my lord, my lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fiddlestick.</p>

<p>What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  The Sheriff and all the watch are at the door.</p>

<p>They are come to search the house. Shall I let them</p>

<p>in?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Dost thou hear, Hal? Never call a true piece</p>

<p>of gold a counterfeit. Thou art essentially made</p>

<p>without seeming so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  And thou a natural coward without instinct.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I deny your major. If you will deny the</p>

<p>Sheriff, so; if not, let him enter. If I become not a</p>

<p>cart as well as another man, a plague on my</p>

<p>bringing up. I hope I shall as soon be strangled with</p>

<p>a halter as another.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[standing]</i>  Go hide thee behind the arras. The</p>

<p>rest walk up above.–Now, my masters, for a true</p>

<p>face and good conscience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Both which I have had, but their date is out;</p>

<p>and therefore I’ll hide me.     <i><i>[He hides.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Call in the Sheriff.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but the Prince and Peto exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sheriff and the Carrier.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Now, Master Sheriff, what is your will with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sheriff</sc></p>

<p>First pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry</p>

<p>Hath followed certain men unto this house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What men?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sheriff</sc></p>

<p>One of them is well known, my gracious lord.</p>

<p>A gross fat man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Carrier</sc>  As fat as butter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>The man I do assure you is not here,</p>

<p>For I myself at this time have employed him.</p>

<p>And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee</p>

<p>That I will by tomorrow dinner time</p>

<p>Send him to answer thee or any man</p>

<p>For anything he shall be charged withal.</p>

<p>And so let me entreat you leave the house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sheriff</sc></p>

<p>I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen</p>

<p>Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>It may be so. If he have robbed these men,</p>

<p>He shall be answerable; and so farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sheriff</sc>  Good night, my noble lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>I think it is good morrow, is it not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sheriff</sc></p>

<p>Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o’clock.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with the Carrier.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  This oily rascal is known as well as Paul’s. Go</p>

<p>call him forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Peto</sc>  Falstaff!–Fast asleep behind the arras, and</p>

<p>snorting like a horse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his</p>

<p>pockets. <i>[(He searcheth his pocket, and findeth certain</p>

<p>papers.)]</i> What hast thou found?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Peto</sc>  Nothing but papers, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Let’s see what they be. Read them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Peto</sc> <i>[reads]</i></p>

<p>Item, a capon,...2s. 2d.</p>

<p>Item, sauce,...4d.</p>

<p>Item, sack, two gallons,...5s. 8d.</p>

<p>Item, anchovies and sack after supper,...2s. 6d.</p>

<p>Item, bread,...ob.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  O monstrous! But one halfpennyworth of</p>

<p>bread to this intolerable deal of sack? What there is</p>

<p>else, keep close. We’ll read it at more advantage.</p>

<p>There let him sleep till day. I’ll to the court in the</p>

<p>morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place</p>

<p>shall be honorable. I’ll procure this fat rogue a</p>

<p>charge of foot, and I know his death will be a march</p>

<p>of twelve score. The money shall be paid back again</p>

<p>with advantage. Be with me betimes in the morning,</p>

<p>and so good morrow, Peto.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Peto</sc>  Good morrow, good my lord.</p>
