<p><center><i>[Enter the King, Lord John of Lancaster, and the Earl</p>

<p>of Westmoreland, with others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</p>

<p>Find we a time for frighted peace to pant</p>

<p>And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</p>

<p>To be commenced in strands afar remote.</p>

<p>No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</p>

<p>Shall daub her lips with her own children’s blood.</p>

<p>No more shall trenching war channel her fields,</p>

<p>Nor bruise her flow’rets with the armed hoofs</p>

<p>Of hostile paces. Those opposed eyes,</p>

<p>Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</p>

<p>All of one nature, of one substance bred,</p>

<p>Did lately meet in the intestine shock</p>

<p>And furious close of civil butchery,</p>

<p>Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</p>

<p>March all one way and be no more opposed</p>

<p>Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.</p>

<p>The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</p>

<p>No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</p>

<p>As far as to the sepulcher of Christ–</p>

<p>Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</p>

<p>We are impressed and engaged to fight–</p>

<p>Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,</p>

<p>Whose arms were molded in their mothers’ womb</p>

<p>To chase these pagans in those holy fields</p>

<p>Over whose acres walked those blessed feet</p>

<p>Which fourteen hundred years ago were nailed</p>

<p>For our advantage on the bitter cross.</p>

<p>But this our purpose now is twelve month old,</p>

<p>And bootless ’tis to tell you we will go.</p>

<p>Therefor we meet not now. Then let me hear</p>

<p>Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,</p>

<p>What yesternight our council did decree</p>

<p>In forwarding this dear expedience.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>My liege, this haste was hot in question,</p>

<p>And many limits of the charge set down</p>

<p>But yesternight, when all athwart there came</p>

<p>A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,</p>

<p>Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,</p>

<p>Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight</p>

<p>Against the irregular and wild Glendower,</p>

<p>Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</p>

<p>A thousand of his people butchered,</p>

<p>Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,</p>

<p>Such beastly shameless transformation</p>

<p>By those Welshwomen done, as may not be</p>

<p>Without much shame retold or spoken of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>It seems then that the tidings of this broil</p>

<p>Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>This matched with other did, my gracious lord.</p>

<p>For more uneven and unwelcome news</p>

<p>Came from the north, and thus it did import:</p>

<p>On Holy-rood Day the gallant Hotspur there,</p>

<p>Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,</p>

<p>That ever valiant and approved Scot,</p>

<p>At Holmedon met, where they did spend</p>

<p>A sad and bloody hour–</p>

<p>As by discharge of their artillery</p>

<p>And shape of likelihood the news was told,</p>

<p>For he that brought them, in the very heat</p>

<p>And pride of their contention did take horse,</p>

<p>Uncertain of the issue any way.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Here is a dear, a true-industrious friend,</p>

<p>Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,</p>

<p>Stained with the variation of each soil</p>

<p>Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,</p>

<p>And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.</p>

<p>The Earl of Douglas is discomfited;</p>

<p>Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights,</p>

<p>Balked in their own blood, did Sir Walter see</p>

<p>On Holmedon’s plains. Of prisoners Hotspur took</p>

<p>Mordake, Earl of Fife and eldest son</p>

<p>To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Atholl,</p>

<p>Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.</p>

<p>And is not this an honorable spoil?</p>

<p>A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>In faith, it is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Yea, there thou mak’st me sad, and mak’st me sin</p>

<p>In envy that my Lord Northumberland</p>

<p>Should be the father to so blest a son,</p>

<p>A son who is the theme of Honor’s tongue,</p>

<p>Amongst a grove the very straightest plant,</p>

<p>Who is sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride;</p>

<p>Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,</p>

<p>See riot and dishonor stain the brow</p>

<p>Of my young Harry. O, that it could be proved</p>

<p>That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged</p>

<p>In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,</p>

<p>And called mine “Percy,” his “Plantagenet”!</p>

<p>Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.</p>

<p>But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,</p>

<p>Of this young Percy’s pride? The prisoners</p>

<p>Which he in this adventure hath surprised</p>

<p>To his own use he keeps, and sends me word</p>

<p>I shall have none but Mordake, Earl of Fife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>This is his uncle’s teaching. This is Worcester,</p>

<p>Malevolent to you in all aspects,</p>

<p>Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up</p>

<p>The crest of youth against your dignity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>But I have sent for him to answer this.</p>

<p>And for this cause awhile we must neglect</p>

<p>Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we</p>

<p>Will hold at Windsor. So inform the lords.</p>

<p>But come yourself with speed to us again,</p>

<p>For more is to be said and to be done</p>

<p>Than out of anger can be uttered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span>  I will, my liege.</p>
