<p><center><i>[Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Douglas, and Vernon.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>We’ll fight with him tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Worcester</sc>  It may not be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc></p>

<p>You give him then advantage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vernon</sc>  Not a whit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>Why say you so? Looks he not for supply?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vernon</sc>  So do we.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  His is certain; ours is doubtful.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Worcester</sc></p>

<p>Good cousin, be advised. Stir not tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vernon</sc> <i>[to Hotspur]</i></p>

<p>Do not, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc>  You do not counsel well.</p>

<p>You speak it out of fear and cold heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vernon</sc></p>

<p>Do me no slander, Douglas. By my life</p>

<p>(And I dare well maintain it with my life),</p>

<p>If well-respected honor bid me on,</p>

<p>I hold as little counsel with weak fear</p>

<p>As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives.</p>

<p>Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle</p>

<p>Which of us fears.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc>  Yea, or tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vernon</sc>  Content.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  Tonight, say I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vernon</sc></p>

<p>Come, come, it may not be. I wonder much,</p>

<p>Being men of such great leading as you are,</p>

<p>That you foresee not what impediments</p>

<p>Drag back our expedition. Certain horse</p>

<p>Of my cousin Vernon’s are not yet come up.</p>

<p>Your uncle Worcester’s horse came but today,</p>

<p>And now their pride and mettle is asleep,</p>

<p>Their courage with hard labor tame and dull,</p>

<p>That not a horse is half the half of himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>So are the horses of the enemy</p>

<p>In general journey-bated and brought low.</p>

<p>The better part of ours are full of rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Worcester</sc></p>

<p>The number of the King exceedeth ours.</p>

<p>For God’s sake, cousin, stay till all come in.</p>

<p><center><i>[The trumpet sounds a parley.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Walter Blunt.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blunt</sc></p>

<p>I come with gracious offers from the King,</p>

<p>If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt, and would to God</p>

<p>You were of our determination.</p>

<p>Some of us love you well, and even those some</p>

<p>Envy your great deservings and good name</p>

<p>Because you are not of our quality</p>

<p>But stand against us like an enemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blunt</sc></p>

<p>And God defend but still I should stand so,</p>

<p>So long as out of limit and true rule</p>

<p>You stand against anointed majesty.</p>

<p>But to my charge. The King hath sent to know</p>

<p>The nature of your griefs, and whereupon</p>

<p>You conjure from the breast of civil peace</p>

<p>Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land</p>

<p>Audacious cruelty. If that the King</p>

<p>Have any way your good deserts forgot,</p>

<p>Which he confesseth to be manifold,</p>

<p>He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed</p>

<p>You shall have your desires with interest</p>

<p>And pardon absolute for yourself and these</p>

<p>Herein misled by your suggestion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>The King is kind, and well we know the King</p>

<p>Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.</p>

<p>My father and my uncle and myself</p>

<p>Did give him that same royalty he wears,</p>

<p>And when he was not six-and-twenty strong,</p>

<p>Sick in the world’s regard, wretched and low,</p>

<p>A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,</p>

<p>My father gave him welcome to the shore;</p>

<p>And when he heard him swear and vow to God</p>

<p>He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,</p>

<p>To sue his livery, and beg his peace</p>

<p>With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,</p>

<p>My father, in kind heart and pity moved,</p>

<p>Swore him assistance and performed it too.</p>

<p>Now when the lords and barons of the realm</p>

<p>Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,</p>

<p>The more and less came in with cap and knee,</p>

<p>Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,</p>

<p>Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,</p>

<p>Laid gifts before him, proffered him their oaths,</p>

<p>Gave him their heirs as pages, followed him</p>

<p>Even at the heels in golden multitudes.</p>

<p>He presently, as greatness knows itself,</p>

<p>Steps me a little higher than his vow</p>

<p>Made to my father while his blood was poor</p>

<p>Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh,</p>

<p>And now forsooth takes on him to reform</p>

<p>Some certain edicts and some strait decrees</p>

<p>That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,</p>

<p>Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep</p>

<p>Over his country’s wrongs, and by this face,</p>

<p>This seeming brow of justice, did he win</p>

<p>The hearts of all that he did angle for,</p>

<p>Proceeded further–cut me off the heads</p>

<p>Of all the favorites that the absent king</p>

<p>In deputation left behind him here</p>

<p>When he was personal in the Irish war.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blunt</sc></p>

<p>Tut, I came not to hear this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  Then to the point.</p>

<p>In short time after, he deposed the King,</p>

<p>Soon after that deprived him of his life</p>

<p>And, in the neck of that, tasked the whole state.</p>

<p>To make that worse, suffered his kinsman March</p>

<p>(Who is, if every owner were well placed,</p>

<p>Indeed his king) to be engaged in Wales,</p>

<p>There without ransom to lie forfeited,</p>

<p>Disgraced me in my happy victories,</p>

<p>Sought to entrap me by intelligence,</p>

<p>Rated mine uncle from the council board,</p>

<p>In rage dismissed my father from the court,</p>

<p>Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,</p>

<p>And in conclusion drove us to seek out</p>

<p>This head of safety, and withal to pry</p>

<p>Into his title, the which we find</p>

<p>Too indirect for long continuance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blunt</sc></p>

<p>Shall I return this answer to the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>Not so, Sir Walter. We’ll withdraw awhile.</p>

<p>Go to the King, and let there be impawned</p>

<p>Some surety for a safe return again,</p>

<p>And in the morning early shall mine uncle</p>

<p>Bring him our purposes. And so farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blunt</sc></p>

<p>I would you would accept of grace and love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>And maybe so we shall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blunt</sc>  Pray God you do.</p>
