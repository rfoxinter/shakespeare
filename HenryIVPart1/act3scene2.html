<p><center><i>[Enter the King, Prince of Wales, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I</p>

<p>Must have some private conference, but be near at</p>

<p>hand,</p>

<p>For we shall presently have need of you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lords exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>I know not whether God will have it so</p>

<p>For some displeasing service I have done,</p>

<p>That, in His secret doom, out of my blood</p>

<p>He’ll breed revengement and a scourge for me.</p>

<p>But thou dost in thy passages of life</p>

<p>Make me believe that thou art only marked</p>

<p>For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven</p>

<p>To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,</p>

<p>Could such inordinate and low desires,</p>

<p>Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean</p>

<p>attempts,</p>

<p>Such barren pleasures, rude society</p>

<p>As thou art matched withal, and grafted to,</p>

<p>Accompany the greatness of thy blood,</p>

<p>And hold their level with thy princely heart?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>So please your Majesty, I would I could</p>

<p>Quit all offenses with as clear excuse</p>

<p>As well as I am doubtless I can purge</p>

<p>Myself of many I am charged withal.</p>

<p>Yet such extenuation let me beg</p>

<p>As, in reproof of many tales devised,</p>

<p>Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,</p>

<p>By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers,</p>

<p>I may for some things true, wherein my youth</p>

<p>Hath faulty wandered and irregular,</p>

<p>Find pardon on my true submission.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>God pardon thee. Yet let me wonder, Harry,</p>

<p>At thy affections, which do hold a wing</p>

<p>Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</p>

<p>Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost,</p>

<p>Which by thy younger brother is supplied,</p>

<p>And art almost an alien to the hearts</p>

<p>Of all the court and princes of my blood.</p>

<p>The hope and expectation of thy time</p>

<p>Is ruined, and the soul of every man</p>

<p>Prophetically do forethink thy fall.</p>

<p>Had I so lavish of my presence been,</p>

<p>So common-hackneyed in the eyes of men,</p>

<p>So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</p>

<p>Opinion, that did help me to the crown,</p>

<p>Had still kept loyal to possession</p>

<p>And left me in reputeless banishment,</p>

<p>A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</p>

<p>By being seldom seen, I could not stir</p>

<p>But like a comet I was wondered at,</p>

<p>That men would tell their children “This is he.”</p>

<p>Others would say “Where? Which is Bolingbroke?”</p>

<p>And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</p>

<p>And dressed myself in such humility</p>

<p>That I did pluck allegiance from men’s hearts,</p>

<p>Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</p>

<p>Even in the presence of the crowned king.</p>

<p>Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,</p>

<p>My presence, like a robe pontifical,</p>

<p>Ne’er seen but wondered at, and so my state,</p>

<p>Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast</p>

<p>And won by rareness such solemnity.</p>

<p>The skipping king, he ambled up and down</p>

<p>With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,</p>

<p>Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,</p>

<p>Mingled his royalty with cap’ring fools,</p>

<p>Had his great name profaned with their scorns,</p>

<p>And gave his countenance, against his name,</p>

<p>To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push</p>

<p>Of every beardless vain comparative;</p>

<p>Grew a companion to the common streets,</p>

<p>Enfeoffed himself to popularity,</p>

<p>That, being daily swallowed by men’s eyes,</p>

<p>They surfeited with honey and began</p>

<p>To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little</p>

<p>More than a little is by much too much.</p>

<p>So, when he had occasion to be seen,</p>

<p>He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</p>

<p>Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</p>

<p>As, sick and blunted with community,</p>

<p>Afford no extraordinary gaze</p>

<p>Such as is bent on sunlike majesty</p>

<p>When it shines seldom in admiring eyes,</p>

<p>But rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down,</p>

<p>Slept in his face, and rendered such aspect</p>

<p>As cloudy men use to their adversaries,</p>

<p>Being with his presence glutted, gorged, and full.</p>

<p>And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,</p>

<p>For thou hast lost thy princely privilege</p>

<p>With vile participation. Not an eye</p>

<p>But is aweary of thy common sight,</p>

<p>Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more,</p>

<p>Which now doth that I would not have it do,</p>

<p>Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,</p>

<p>Be more myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  For all the world</p>

<p>As thou art to this hour was Richard then</p>

<p>When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,</p>

<p>And even as I was then is Percy now.</p>

<p>Now, by my scepter, and my soul to boot,</p>

<p>He hath more worthy interest to the state</p>

<p>Than thou, the shadow of succession.</p>

<p>For of no right, nor color like to right,</p>

<p>He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,</p>

<p>Turns head against the lion’s armed jaws,</p>

<p>And, being no more in debt to years than thou,</p>

<p>Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on</p>

<p>To bloody battles and to bruising arms.</p>

<p>What never-dying honor hath he got</p>

<p>Against renowned Douglas, whose high deeds,</p>

<p>Whose hot incursions and great name in arms,</p>

<p>Holds from all soldiers chief majority</p>

<p>And military title capital</p>

<p>Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ.</p>

<p>Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swaddling</p>

<p>clothes,</p>

<p>This infant warrior, in his enterprises</p>

<p>Discomfited great Douglas, ta’en him once,</p>

<p>Enlarged him, and made a friend of him,</p>

<p>To fill the mouth of deep defiance up</p>

<p>And shake the peace and safety of our throne.</p>

<p>And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,</p>

<p>The Archbishop’s Grace of York, Douglas,</p>

<p>Mortimer,</p>

<p>Capitulate against us and are up.</p>

<p>But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?</p>

<p>Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,</p>

<p>Which art my nearest and dearest enemy?</p>

<p>Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,</p>

<p>Base inclination, and the start of spleen,</p>

<p>To fight against me under Percy’s pay,</p>

<p>To dog his heels, and curtsy at his frowns,</p>

<p>To show how much thou art degenerate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>Do not think so. You shall not find it so.</p>

<p>And God forgive them that so much have swayed</p>

<p>Your Majesty’s good thoughts away from me.</p>

<p>I will redeem all this on Percy’s head,</p>

<p>And, in the closing of some glorious day,</p>

<p>Be bold to tell you that I am your son,</p>

<p>When I will wear a garment all of blood</p>

<p>And stain my favors in a bloody mask,</p>

<p>Which, washed away, shall scour my shame with it.</p>

<p>And that shall be the day, whene’er it lights,</p>

<p>That this same child of honor and renown,</p>

<p>This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,</p>

<p>And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.</p>

<p>For every honor sitting on his helm,</p>

<p>Would they were multitudes, and on my head</p>

<p>My shames redoubled! For the time will come</p>

<p>That I shall make this northern youth exchange</p>

<p>His glorious deeds for my indignities.</p>

<p>Percy is but my factor, good my lord,</p>

<p>To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf.</p>

<p>And I will call him to so strict account</p>

<p>That he shall render every glory up,</p>

<p>Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,</p>

<p>Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.</p>

<p>This in the name of God I promise here,</p>

<p>The which if He be pleased I shall perform,</p>

<p>I do beseech your Majesty may salve</p>

<p>The long-grown wounds of my intemperance.</p>

<p>If not, the end of life cancels all bands,</p>

<p>And I will die a hundred thousand deaths</p>

<p>Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>A hundred thousand rebels die in this.</p>

<p>Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Blunt.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, good Blunt? Thy looks are full of speed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Blunt</span></p>

<p>So hath the business that I come to speak of.</p>

<p>Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word</p>

<p>That Douglas and the English rebels met</p>

<p>The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>A mighty and a fearful head they are,</p>

<p>If promises be kept on every hand,</p>

<p>As ever offered foul play in a state.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>The Earl of Westmoreland set forth today,</p>

<p>With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster,</p>

<p>For this advertisement is five days old.–</p>

<p>On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward.</p>

<p>On Thursday we ourselves will march. Our meeting</p>

<p>Is Bridgenorth. And, Harry, you shall march</p>

<p>Through Gloucestershire; by which account,</p>

<p>Our business valued, some twelve days hence</p>

<p>Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.</p>

<p>Our hands are full of business. Let’s away.</p>

<p>Advantage feeds him fat while men delay.</p>
