<p><center><i>[The King enters with his power, crosses the stage and</p>

<p>exits. Alarum to the battle. Then enter Douglas, and Sir</p>

<p>Walter Blunt, disguised as the King.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blunt</sc> <i>[as King]</i></p>

<p>What is thy name that in the battle thus</p>

<p>Thou crossest me? What honor dost thou seek</p>

<p>Upon my head?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc>  Know then my name is Douglas,</p>

<p>And I do haunt thee in the battle thus</p>

<p>Because some tell me that thou art a king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blunt</sc> <i>[as King]</i>  They tell thee true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc></p>

<p>The Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought</p>

<p>Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,</p>

<p>This sword hath ended him. So shall it thee,</p>

<p>Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blunt</sc> <i>[as King]</i></p>

<p>I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot,</p>

<p>And thou shalt find a king that will revenge</p>

<p>Lord Stafford’s death.</p>

<p><center><i>[They fight. Douglas kills Blunt.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Then enter Hotspur.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,</p>

<p>I never had triumphed upon a Scot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc></p>

<p>All’s done, all’s won; here breathless lies the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  Where?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc>  Here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>This, Douglas? No, I know this face full well.</p>

<p>A gallant knight he was; his name was Blunt,</p>

<p>Semblably furnished like the King himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc> <i>[addressing Blunt’s corpse]</i></p>

<p>A fool go with thy soul whither it goes!</p>

<p>A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear.</p>

<p>Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>The King hath many marching in his coats.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc></p>

<p>Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats.</p>

<p>I’ll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,</p>

<p>Until I meet the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  Up and away!</p>

<p>Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Alarm. Enter Falstaff alone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Though I could ’scape shot-free at London,</p>

<p>I fear the shot here. Here’s no scoring but upon</p>

<p>the pate.–Soft, who are you? Sir Walter Blunt.</p>

<p>There’s honor for you. Here’s no vanity. I am as hot</p>

<p>as molten lead, and as heavy too. God keep lead out</p>

<p>of me; I need no more weight than mine own</p>

<p>bowels. I have led my ragamuffins where they are</p>

<p>peppered. There’s not three of my hundred and fifty</p>

<p>left alive, and they are for the town’s end, to beg</p>

<p>during life. But who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Prince.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>What, stand’st thou idle here? Lend me thy sword.</p>

<p>Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff</p>

<p>Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,</p>

<p>Whose deaths are yet unrevenged. I prithee</p>

<p>Lend me thy sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  O Hal, I prithee give me leave to breathe</p>

<p>awhile. Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms</p>

<p>as I have done this day. I have paid Percy; I have</p>

<p>made him sure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>He is indeed, and living to kill thee.</p>

<p>I prithee, lend me thy sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou</p>

<p>gett’st not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou</p>

<p>wilt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Give it me. What, is it in the case?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Ay, Hal, ’tis hot, ’tis hot. There’s that will</p>

<p>sack a city.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Prince draws it out, and finds it</p>

<p>to be a bottle of sack.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>What, is it a time to jest and dally now?</p>

<p><center><i>[He throws the bottle at him and exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Well, if Percy be alive, I’ll pierce him. If he do</p>

<p>come in my way, so; if he do not, if I come in his</p>

<p>willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like not</p>

<p>such grinning honor as Sir Walter hath. Give me</p>

<p>life, which, if I can save, so: if not, honor comes</p>

<p>unlooked for, and there’s an end.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits. Blunt’s body is carried off.]</i></center></p>
