<p><center><i>[Enter Worcester and Sir Richard Vernon.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>O no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,</p>

<p>The liberal and kind offer of the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>’Twere best he did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span>  Then are we all undone.</p>

<p>It is not possible, it cannot be</p>

<p>The King should keep his word in loving us.</p>

<p>He will suspect us still and find a time</p>

<p>To punish this offense in other faults.</p>

<p>Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of</p>

<p>eyes,</p>

<p>For treason is but trusted like the fox,</p>

<p>Who, never so tame, so cherished and locked up,</p>

<p>Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.</p>

<p>Look how we can, or sad or merrily,</p>

<p>Interpretation will misquote our looks,</p>

<p>And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,</p>

<p>The better cherished still the nearer death.</p>

<p>My nephew’s trespass may be well forgot;</p>

<p>It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,</p>

<p>And an adopted name of privilege–</p>

<p>A harebrained Hotspur governed by a spleen.</p>

<p>All his offenses live upon my head</p>

<p>And on his father’s. We did train him on,</p>

<p>And his corruption being ta’en from us,</p>

<p>We as the spring of all shall pay for all.</p>

<p>Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know</p>

<p>In any case the offer of the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>Deliver what you will; I’ll say ’tis so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hotspur, Douglas, and their army.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes your cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span> <i>[to Douglas]</i>  My uncle is returned.</p>

<p>Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.–</p>

<p>Uncle, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>The King will bid you battle presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Douglas</span> <i>[to Hotspur]</i></p>

<p>Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Douglas</span></p>

<p>Marry, and shall, and very willingly.     <i><i>[Douglas exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>There is no seeming mercy in the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Did you beg any? God forbid!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>I told him gently of our grievances,</p>

<p>Of his oath-breaking, which he mended thus</p>

<p>By now forswearing that he is forsworn.</p>

<p>He calls us “rebels,” “traitors,” and will scourge</p>

<p>With haughty arms this hateful name in us.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Douglas.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Douglas</span></p>

<p>Arm, gentlemen, to arms. For I have thrown</p>

<p>A brave defiance in King Henry’s teeth,</p>

<p>And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it,</p>

<p>Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>The Prince of Wales stepped forth before the King,</p>

<p>And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,</p>

<p>And that no man might draw short breath today</p>

<p>But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,</p>

<p>How showed his tasking? Seemed it in contempt?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>No, by my soul. I never in my life</p>

<p>Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,</p>

<p>Unless a brother should a brother dare</p>

<p>To gentle exercise and proof of arms.</p>

<p>He gave you all the duties of a man,</p>

<p>Trimmed up your praises with a princely tongue,</p>

<p>Spoke your deservings like a chronicle,</p>

<p>Making you ever better than his praise</p>

<p>By still dispraising praise valued with you,</p>

<p>And, which became him like a prince indeed,</p>

<p>He made a blushing cital of himself,</p>

<p>And chid his truant youth with such a grace</p>

<p>As if he mastered there a double spirit</p>

<p>Of teaching and of learning instantly.</p>

<p>There did he pause, but let me tell the world:</p>

<p>If he outlive the envy of this day,</p>

<p>England did never owe so sweet a hope</p>

<p>So much misconstrued in his wantonness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Cousin, I think thou art enamored</p>

<p>On his follies. Never did I hear</p>

<p>Of any prince so wild a liberty.</p>

<p>But be he as he will, yet once ere night</p>

<p>I will embrace him with a soldier’s arm</p>

<p>That he shall shrink under my courtesy.–</p>

<p>Arm, arm with speed, and, fellows, soldiers,</p>

<p>friends,</p>

<p>Better consider what you have to do</p>

<p>Than I that have not well the gift of tongue</p>

<p>Can lift your blood up with persuasion.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  My lord, here are letters for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  I cannot read them now.–</p>

<p>O gentlemen, the time of life is short;</p>

<p>To spend that shortness basely were too long</p>

<p>If life did ride upon a dial’s point,</p>

<p>Still ending at the arrival of an hour.</p>

<p>An if we live, we live to tread on kings;</p>

<p>If die, brave death, when princes die with us.</p>

<p>Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair</p>

<p>When the intent of bearing them is just.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter another Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>My lord, prepare. The King comes on apace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>I thank him that he cuts me from my tale,</p>

<p>For I profess not talking. Only this:</p>

<p>Let each man do his best. And here draw I a sword,</p>

<p>Whose temper I intend to stain</p>

<p>With the best blood that I can meet withal</p>

<p>In the adventure of this perilous day.</p>

<p>Now, Esperance! Percy! And set on.</p>

<p>Sound all the lofty instruments of war,</p>

<p>And by that music let us all embrace,</p>

<p>For, heaven to Earth, some of us never shall</p>

<p>A second time do such a courtesy.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here they embrace. The trumpets sound.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
