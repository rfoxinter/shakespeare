<p><center><i>[Enter Prince of Wales, and Sir John Falstaff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old</p>

<p>sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and</p>

<p>sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast</p>

<p>forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst</p>

<p>truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with</p>

<p>the time of the day? Unless hours were cups of</p>

<p>sack, and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues</p>

<p>of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses,</p>

<p>and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in</p>

<p>flame-colored taffeta, I see no reason why thou</p>

<p>shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time</p>

<p>of the day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we</p>

<p>that take purses go by the moon and the seven</p>

<p>stars, and not by Phoebus, he, that wand’ring</p>

<p>knight so fair. And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou</p>

<p>art king, as God save thy Grace–Majesty, I should</p>

<p>say, for grace thou wilt have none–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  What, none?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to</p>

<p>be prologue to an egg and butter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Well, how then? Come, roundly, roundly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Marry then, sweet wag, when thou art king,</p>

<p>let not us that are squires of the night’s body be</p>

<p>called thieves of the day’s beauty. Let us be Diana’s</p>

<p>foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the</p>

<p>moon, and let men say we be men of good government,</p>

<p>being governed, as the sea is, by our noble</p>

<p>and chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance</p>

<p>we steal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the</p>

<p>fortune of us that are the moon’s men doth ebb and</p>

<p>flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is, by</p>

<p>the moon. As for proof now: a purse of gold most</p>

<p>resolutely snatched on Monday night and most</p>

<p>dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with</p>

<p>swearing “Lay by” and spent with crying “Bring</p>

<p>in”; now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder,</p>

<p>and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the</p>

<p>gallows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  By the Lord, thou sayst true, lad. And is not</p>

<p>my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle.</p>

<p>And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of</p>

<p>durance?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy</p>

<p>quips and thy quiddities? What a plague have I to</p>

<p>do with a buff jerkin?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess</p>

<p>of the tavern?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning</p>

<p>many a time and oft.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  No, I’ll give thee thy due. Thou hast paid all</p>

<p>there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would</p>

<p>stretch, and where it would not, I have used my</p>

<p>credit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Yea, and so used it that were it not here</p>

<p>apparent that thou art heir apparent–But I prithee,</p>

<p>sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in</p>

<p>England when thou art king? And resolution thus</p>

<p>fubbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father Antic</p>

<p>the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a</p>

<p>thief.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  No, thou shalt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I’ll be a brave</p>

<p>judge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Thou judgest false already. I mean thou shalt</p>

<p>have the hanging of the thieves, and so become a</p>

<p>rare hangman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps</p>

<p>with my humor as well as waiting in the court, I</p>

<p>can tell you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  For obtaining of suits?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman</p>

<p>hath no lean wardrobe. ’Sblood, I am as</p>

<p>melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Or an old lion, or a lover’s lute.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy</p>

<p>of Moorditch?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Thou hast the most unsavory similes, and</p>

<p>art indeed the most comparative, rascaliest, sweet</p>

<p>young prince. But, Hal, I prithee trouble me no</p>

<p>more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew</p>

<p>where a commodity of good names were to be</p>

<p>bought. An old lord of the council rated me the</p>

<p>other day in the street about you, sir, but I marked</p>

<p>him not, and yet he talked very wisely, but I</p>

<p>regarded him not, and yet he talked wisely, and in</p>

<p>the street, too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the</p>

<p>streets and no man regards it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art</p>

<p>indeed able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done</p>

<p>much harm upon me, Hal, God forgive thee for it.</p>

<p>Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now</p>

<p>am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than</p>

<p>one of the wicked. I must give over this life, and I</p>

<p>will give it over. By the Lord, an I do not, I am a</p>

<p>villain. I’ll be damned for never a king’s son in</p>

<p>Christendom.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Zounds, where thou wilt, lad. I’ll make one.</p>

<p>An I do not, call me villain and baffle me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  I see a good amendment of life in thee, from</p>

<p>praying to purse-taking.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Why, Hal, ’tis my vocation, Hal. ’Tis no sin</p>

<p>for a man to labor in his vocation.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Poins.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Poins!–Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a</p>

<p>match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what</p>

<p>hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the</p>

<p>most omnipotent villain that ever cried “Stand!” to</p>

<p>a true man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Good morrow, Ned.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poins</span>  Good morrow, sweet Hal.–What says Monsieur</p>

<p>Remorse? What says Sir John Sack-and-Sugar?</p>

<p>Jack, how agrees the devil and thee about</p>

<p>thy soul that thou soldest him on Good Friday last</p>

<p>for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon’s leg?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Sir John stands to his word. The devil shall</p>

<p>have his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of</p>

<p>proverbs. He will give the devil his due.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poins</span> <i>[to Falstaff]</i>  Then art thou damned for keeping</p>

<p>thy word with the devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Else he had been damned for cozening the</p>

<p>devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poins</span>  But, my lads, my lads, tomorrow morning, by</p>

<p>four o’clock early at Gad’s Hill, there are pilgrims</p>

<p>going to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders</p>

<p>riding to London with fat purses. I have vizards for</p>

<p>you all. You have horses for yourselves. Gadshill lies</p>

<p>tonight in Rochester. I have bespoke supper tomorrow</p>

<p>night in Eastcheap. We may do it as secure as</p>

<p>sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of</p>

<p>crowns. If you will not, tarry at home and be</p>

<p>hanged.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Hear you, Yedward, if I tarry at home and</p>

<p>go not, I’ll hang you for going.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poins</span>  You will, chops?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Hal, wilt thou make one?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Who, I rob? I a thief? Not I, by my faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  There’s neither honesty, manhood, nor</p>

<p>good fellowship in thee, nor thou cam’st not of</p>

<p>the blood royal, if thou darest not stand for ten</p>

<p>shillings.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Well then, once in my days I’ll be a madcap.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Why, that’s well said.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Well, come what will, I’ll tarry at home.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  By the Lord, I’ll be a traitor then when thou</p>

<p>art king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  I care not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poins</span>  Sir John, I prithee leave the Prince and me</p>

<p>alone. I will lay him down such reasons for this</p>

<p>adventure that he shall go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion,</p>

<p>and him the ears of profiting, that what thou</p>

<p>speakest may move, and what he hears may be</p>

<p>believed, that the true prince may, for recreation</p>

<p>sake, prove a false thief, for the poor abuses of the</p>

<p>time want countenance. Farewell. You shall find me</p>

<p>in Eastcheap.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Farewell, thou latter spring. Farewell, Allhallown</p>

<p>summer.     <i><i>[Falstaff exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poins</span>  Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us</p>

<p>tomorrow. I have a jest to execute that I cannot</p>

<p>manage alone. Falstaff, Peto, Bardolph, and Gadshill</p>

<p>shall rob those men that we have already</p>

<p>waylaid. Yourself and I will not be there. And when</p>

<p>they have the booty, if you and I do not rob them,</p>

<p>cut this head off from my shoulders.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  How shall we part with them in setting forth?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poins</span>  Why, we will set forth before or after them, and</p>

<p>appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at our</p>

<p>pleasure to fail; and then will they adventure upon</p>

<p>the exploit themselves, which they shall have no</p>

<p>sooner achieved but we’ll set upon them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Yea, but ’tis like that they will know us by our</p>

<p>horses, by our habits, and by every other appointment</p>

<p>to be ourselves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poins</span>  Tut, our horses they shall not see; I’ll tie them</p>

<p>in the wood. Our vizards we will change after we</p>

<p>leave them. And, sirrah, I have cases of buckram</p>

<p>for the nonce, to immask our noted outward</p>

<p>garments.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poins</span>  Well, for two of them, I know them to be as</p>

<p>true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the</p>

<p>third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I’ll</p>

<p>forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be the</p>

<p>incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will</p>

<p>tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty at least</p>

<p>he fought with, what wards, what blows, what</p>

<p>extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this</p>

<p>lives the jest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Well, I’ll go with thee. Provide us all things</p>

<p>necessary and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap.</p>

<p>There I’ll sup. Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poins</span>  Farewell, my lord.     <i><i>[Poins exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>I know you all, and will awhile uphold</p>

<p>The unyoked humor of your idleness.</p>

<p>Yet herein will I imitate the sun,</p>

<p>Who doth permit the base contagious clouds</p>

<p>To smother up his beauty from the world,</p>

<p>That, when he please again to be himself,</p>

<p>Being wanted, he may be more wondered at</p>

<p>By breaking through the foul and ugly mists</p>

<p>Of vapors that did seem to strangle him.</p>

<p>If all the year were playing holidays,</p>

<p>To sport would be as tedious as to work,</p>

<p>But when they seldom come, they wished-for come,</p>

<p>And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.</p>

<p>So when this loose behavior I throw off</p>

<p>And pay the debt I never promised,</p>

<p>By how much better than my word I am,</p>

<p>By so much shall I falsify men’s hopes;</p>

<p>And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,</p>

<p>My reformation, glitt’ring o’er my fault,</p>

<p>Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes</p>

<p>Than that which hath no foil to set it off.</p>

<p>I’ll so offend to make offense a skill,</p>

<p>Redeeming time when men think least I will.</p>
