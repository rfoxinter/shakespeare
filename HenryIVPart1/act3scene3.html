<p><center><i>[Enter Falstaff and Bardolph.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since</p>

<p>this last action? Do I not bate? Do I not dwindle?</p>

<p>Why, my skin hangs about me like an old lady’s</p>

<p>loose gown. I am withered like an old applejohn.</p>

<p>Well, I’ll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in</p>

<p>some liking. I shall be out of heart shortly, and then</p>

<p>I shall have no strength to repent. An I have not</p>

<p>forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I</p>

<p>am a peppercorn, a brewer’s horse. The inside of a</p>

<p>church! Company, villainous company, hath been</p>

<p>the spoil of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Sir John, you are so fretful you cannot live</p>

<p>long.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Why, there is it. Come, sing me a bawdy</p>

<p>song, make me merry. I was as virtuously given as a</p>

<p>gentleman need to be, virtuous enough: swore</p>

<p>little; diced not above seven times–a week; went to</p>

<p>a bawdy house not above once in a quarter–of an</p>

<p>hour; paid money that I borrowed–three or four</p>

<p>times; lived well and in good compass; and now I</p>

<p>live out of all order, out of all compass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must</p>

<p>needs be out of all compass, out of all reasonable</p>

<p>compass, Sir John.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Do thou amend thy face, and I’ll amend my</p>

<p>life. Thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern</p>

<p>in the poop, but ’tis in the nose of thee. Thou art the</p>

<p>Knight of the Burning Lamp.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  No, I’ll be sworn, I make as good use of it as</p>

<p>many a man doth of a death’s-head or a memento</p>

<p>mori. I never see thy face but I think upon hellfire</p>

<p>and Dives that lived in purple, for there he is in his</p>

<p>robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way given</p>

<p>to virtue, I would swear by thy face. My oath should</p>

<p>be “By this fire, that’s God’s angel.” But thou art</p>

<p>altogether given over, and wert indeed, but for the</p>

<p>light in thy face, the son of utter darkness. When</p>

<p>thou ran’st up Gad’s Hill in the night to catch my</p>

<p>horse, if I did not think thou hadst been an ignis</p>

<p>fatuus, or a ball of wildfire, there’s no purchase in</p>

<p>money. O, thou art a perpetual triumph, an everlasting</p>

<p>bonfire-light. Thou hast saved me a thousand</p>

<p>marks in links and torches, walking with thee in the</p>

<p>night betwixt tavern and tavern, but the sack that</p>

<p>thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as</p>

<p>good cheap at the dearest chandler’s in Europe. I</p>

<p>have maintained that salamander of yours with fire</p>

<p>any time this two-and-thirty years, God reward me</p>

<p>for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  ’Sblood, I would my face were in your</p>

<p>belly!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Godamercy, so should I be sure to be</p>

<p>heartburned!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hostess.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Dame Partlet the hen, have you enquired</p>

<p>yet who picked my pocket?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John,</p>

<p>do you think I keep thieves in my house? I have</p>

<p>searched, I have enquired, so has my husband,</p>

<p>man by man, boy by boy, servant by servant.</p>

<p>The tithe of a hair was never lost in my house</p>

<p>before.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  You lie, hostess. Bardolph was shaved and</p>

<p>lost many a hair, and I’ll be sworn my pocket was</p>

<p>picked. Go to, you are a woman, go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Who, I? No, I defy thee! God’s light, I was</p>

<p>never called so in mine own house before.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Go to, I know you well enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  No, Sir John, you do not know me, Sir John. I</p>

<p>know you, Sir John. You owe me money, Sir John,</p>

<p>and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it. I</p>

<p>bought you a dozen of shirts to your back.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Dowlas, filthy dowlas. I have given them</p>

<p>away to bakers’ wives; they have made bolters of</p>

<p>them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight</p>

<p>shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir</p>

<p>John, for your diet and by-drinkings and money</p>

<p>lent you, four-and-twenty pound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[pointing to Bardolph]</i>  He had his part of it.</p>

<p>Let him pay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  He? Alas, he is poor. He hath nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  How, poor? Look upon his face. What call</p>

<p>you rich? Let them coin his nose. Let them coin his</p>

<p>cheeks. I’ll not pay a denier. What, will you make a</p>

<p>younker of me? Shall I not take mine ease in mine</p>

<p>inn but I shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a</p>

<p>seal ring of my grandfather’s worth forty mark.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc> <i>[to Bardolph]</i>  O Jesu, I have heard the Prince</p>

<p>tell him, I know not how oft, that that ring was</p>

<p>copper.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  How? The Prince is a jack, a sneak-up.</p>

<p>’Sblood, an he were here, I would cudgel him like a</p>

<p>dog if he would say so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Prince marching, with Peto, and Falstaff</p>

<p>meets him playing upon his truncheon like a fife.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, lad, is the wind in that door, i’ faith? Must</p>

<p>we all march?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc> <i>[to Prince]</i>  My lord, I pray you, hear me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What say’st thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth</p>

<p>thy husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Good my lord, hear me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What say’st thou, Jack?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  The other night I fell asleep here, behind the</p>

<p>arras, and had my pocket picked. This house is</p>

<p>turned bawdy house; they pick pockets.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What didst thou lose, Jack?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Wilt thou believe me, Hal, three or four</p>

<p>bonds of forty pound apiece, and a seal ring of my</p>

<p>grandfather’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  A trifle, some eightpenny matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard</p>

<p>your Grace say so. And, my lord, he speaks most</p>

<p>vilely of you, like a foul-mouthed man, as he is, and</p>

<p>said he would cudgel you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What, he did not!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  There’s neither faith, truth, nor womanhood</p>

<p>in me else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  There’s no more faith in thee than in a</p>

<p>stewed prune, nor no more truth in thee than in a</p>

<p>drawn fox, and for womanhood, Maid Marian may</p>

<p>be the deputy’s wife of the ward to thee. Go, you</p>

<p>thing, go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Say, what thing, what thing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What thing? Why, a thing to thank God on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou</p>

<p>shouldst know it! I am an honest man’s wife, and,</p>

<p>setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to</p>

<p>call me so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a</p>

<p>beast to say otherwise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What beast? Why, an otter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  An otter, Sir John. Why an otter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Why, she’s neither fish nor flesh; a man</p>

<p>knows not where to have her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Thou art an unjust man in saying so. Thou or</p>

<p>any man knows where to have me, thou knave,</p>

<p>thou.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Thou sayst true, hostess, and he slanders thee</p>

<p>most grossly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  So he doth you, my lord, and said this other</p>

<p>day you owed him a thousand pound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  A thousand pound, Hal? A million. Thy love is</p>

<p>worth a million; thou owest me thy love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Nay, my lord, he called you “jack,” and said</p>

<p>he would cudgel you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Did I, Bardolph?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Indeed, Sir John, you said so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Yea, if he said my ring was copper.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I say ’tis copper. Darest thou be as good as thy</p>

<p>word now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but</p>

<p>man, I dare, but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I</p>

<p>fear the roaring of the lion’s whelp.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  And why not as the lion?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  The King himself is to be feared as the lion.</p>

<p>Dost thou think I’ll fear thee as I fear thy father?</p>

<p>Nay, an I do, I pray God my girdle break.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about</p>

<p>thy knees! But, sirrah, there’s no room for faith,</p>

<p>truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine. It is all</p>

<p>filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest</p>

<p>woman with picking thy pocket? Why, thou whoreson,</p>

<p>impudent, embossed rascal, if there were</p>

<p>anything in thy pocket but tavern reckonings,</p>

<p>memorandums of bawdy houses, and one poor</p>

<p>pennyworth of sugar candy to make thee long-winded,</p>

<p>if thy pocket were enriched with any other</p>

<p>injuries but these, I am a villain. And yet you will</p>

<p>stand to it! You will not pocket up wrong! Art thou</p>

<p>not ashamed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Dost thou hear, Hal? Thou knowest in the</p>

<p>state of innocency Adam fell, and what should poor</p>

<p>Jack Falstaff do in the days of villainy? Thou seest I</p>

<p>have more flesh than another man and therefore</p>

<p>more frailty. You confess, then, you picked my</p>

<p>pocket.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  It appears so by the story.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Hostess, I forgive thee. Go make ready</p>

<p>breakfast, love thy husband, look to thy servants,</p>

<p>cherish thy guests. Thou shalt find me tractable</p>

<p>to any honest reason. Thou seest I am pacified still.</p>

<p>Nay, prithee, begone. <i>[(Hostess exits.)]</i> Now, Hal, to</p>

<p>the news at court. For the robbery, lad, how is that</p>

<p>answered?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to</p>

<p>thee. The money is paid back again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  O, I do not like that paying back. ’Tis a double</p>

<p>labor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I am good friends with my father and may do</p>

<p>anything.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Rob me the Exchequer the first thing thou</p>

<p>dost, and do it with unwashed hands too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Do, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I would it had been of horse. Where shall I</p>

<p>find one that can steal well? O, for a fine thief of</p>

<p>the age of two-and-twenty or thereabouts! I am heinously</p>

<p>unprovided. Well, God be thanked for these</p>

<p>rebels. They offend none but the virtuous. I laud</p>

<p>them; I praise them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Bardolph.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  My lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[handing Bardolph papers]</i></p>

<p>Go, bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster,</p>

<p>To my brother John; this to my Lord of</p>

<p>Westmoreland.     <i><i>[Bardolph exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Go, Peto, to horse, to horse, for thou and I</p>

<p>Have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.</p>

<p><center><i>[Peto exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Jack, meet me tomorrow in the Temple hall</p>

<p>At two o’clock in the afternoon;</p>

<p>There shalt thou know thy charge, and there receive</p>

<p>Money and order for their furniture.</p>

<p>The land is burning. Percy stands on high,</p>

<p>And either we or they must lower lie.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc></p>

<p>Rare words, brave world!–Hostess, my breakfast,</p>

<p>come.–</p>

<p>O, I could wish this tavern were my drum.</p>
