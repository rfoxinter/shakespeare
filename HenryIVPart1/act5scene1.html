<p><center><i>[Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,</p>

<p>Sir Walter Blunt, and Falstaff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>How bloodily the sun begins to peer</p>

<p>Above yon bulky hill. The day looks pale</p>

<p>At his distemp’rature.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  The southern wind</p>

<p>Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,</p>

<p>And by his hollow whistling in the leaves</p>

<p>Foretells a tempest and a blust’ring day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Then with the losers let it sympathize,</p>

<p>For nothing can seem foul to those that win.</p>

<p><center><i>[The trumpet sounds.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Worcester and Vernon.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, my Lord of Worcester? ’Tis not well</p>

<p>That you and I should meet upon such terms</p>

<p>As now we meet. You have deceived our trust</p>

<p>And made us doff our easy robes of peace</p>

<p>To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel.</p>

<p>This is not well, my lord; this is not well.</p>

<p>What say you to it? Will you again unknit</p>

<p>This churlish knot of all-abhorred war</p>

<p>And move in that obedient orb again</p>

<p>Where you did give a fair and natural light,</p>

<p>And be no more an exhaled meteor,</p>

<p>A prodigy of fear, and a portent</p>

<p>Of broached mischief to the unborn times?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span>  Hear me, my liege:</p>

<p>For mine own part I could be well content</p>

<p>To entertain the lag end of my life</p>

<p>With quiet hours. For I protest</p>

<p>I have not sought the day of this dislike.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>You have not sought it. How comes it then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Peace, chewet, peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>It pleased your Majesty to turn your looks</p>

<p>Of favor from myself and all our house;</p>

<p>And yet I must remember you, my lord,</p>

<p>We were the first and dearest of your friends.</p>

<p>For you my staff of office did I break</p>

<p>In Richard’s time, and posted day and night</p>

<p>To meet you on the way and kiss your hand</p>

<p>When yet you were in place and in account</p>

<p>Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.</p>

<p>It was myself, my brother, and his son</p>

<p>That brought you home and boldly did outdare</p>

<p>The dangers of the time. You swore to us,</p>

<p>And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,</p>

<p>That you did nothing purpose ’gainst the state,</p>

<p>Nor claim no further than your new-fall’n right,</p>

<p>The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster.</p>

<p>To this we swore our aid. But in short space</p>

<p>It rained down fortune show’ring on your head,</p>

<p>And such a flood of greatness fell on you–</p>

<p>What with our help, what with the absent king,</p>

<p>What with the injuries of a wanton time,</p>

<p>The seeming sufferances that you had borne,</p>

<p>And the contrarious winds that held the King</p>

<p>So long in his unlucky Irish wars</p>

<p>That all in England did repute him dead–</p>

<p>And from this swarm of fair advantages</p>

<p>You took occasion to be quickly wooed</p>

<p>To gripe the general sway into your hand,</p>

<p>Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster;</p>

<p>And being fed by us, you used us so</p>

<p>As that ungentle gull, the cuckoo’s bird,</p>

<p>Useth the sparrow–did oppress our nest,</p>

<p>Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk</p>

<p>That even our love durst not come near your sight</p>

<p>For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing</p>

<p>We were enforced for safety sake to fly</p>

<p>Out of your sight and raise this present head,</p>

<p>Whereby we stand opposed by such means</p>

<p>As you yourself have forged against yourself</p>

<p>By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,</p>

<p>And violation of all faith and troth</p>

<p>Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>These things indeed you have articulate,</p>

<p>Proclaimed at market crosses, read in churches,</p>

<p>To face the garment of rebellion</p>

<p>With some fine color that may please the eye</p>

<p>Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,</p>

<p>Which gape and rub the elbow at the news</p>

<p>Of hurlyburly innovation.</p>

<p>And never yet did insurrection want</p>

<p>Such water colors to impaint his cause,</p>

<p>Nor moody beggars starving for a time</p>

<p>Of pellmell havoc and confusion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>In both your armies there is many a soul</p>

<p>Shall pay full dearly for this encounter</p>

<p>If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world</p>

<p>In praise of Henry Percy. By my hopes,</p>

<p>This present enterprise set off his head,</p>

<p>I do not think a braver gentleman,</p>

<p>More active-valiant, or more valiant-young,</p>

<p>More daring or more bold, is now alive</p>

<p>To grace this latter age with noble deeds.</p>

<p>For my part, I may speak it to my shame,</p>

<p>I have a truant been to chivalry,</p>

<p>And so I hear he doth account me too.</p>

<p>Yet this before my father’s majesty:</p>

<p>I am content that he shall take the odds</p>

<p>Of his great name and estimation,</p>

<p>And will, to save the blood on either side,</p>

<p>Try fortune with him in a single fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,</p>

<p>Albeit considerations infinite</p>

<p>Do make against it.–No, good Worcester, no.</p>

<p>We love our people well, even those we love</p>

<p>That are misled upon your cousin’s part.</p>

<p>And, will they take the offer of our grace,</p>

<p>Both he and they and you, yea, every man</p>

<p>Shall be my friend again, and I’ll be his.</p>

<p>So tell your cousin, and bring me word</p>

<p>What he will do. But if he will not yield,</p>

<p>Rebuke and dread correction wait on us,</p>

<p>And they shall do their office. So begone.</p>

<p>We will not now be troubled with reply.</p>

<p>We offer fair. Take it advisedly.</p>

<p><center><i>[Worcester exits with Vernon.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>It will not be accepted, on my life.</p>

<p>The Douglas and the Hotspur both together</p>

<p>Are confident against the world in arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge,</p>

<p>For on their answer will we set on them,</p>

<p>And God befriend us as our cause is just.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit. Prince and Falstaff remain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and</p>

<p>bestride me, so; ’tis a point of friendship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.</p>

<p>Say thy prayers, and farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  I would ’twere bedtime, Hal, and all well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Why, thou owest God a death.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  ’Tis not due yet. I would be loath to pay Him</p>

<p>before His day. What need I be so forward with</p>

<p>Him that calls not on me? Well, ’tis no matter.</p>

<p>Honor pricks me on. Yea, but how if honor prick me</p>

<p>off when I come on? How then? Can honor set to a</p>

<p>leg? No. Or an arm? No. Or take away the grief of a</p>

<p>wound? No. Honor hath no skill in surgery, then?</p>

<p>No. What is honor? A word. What is in that word</p>

<p>“honor”? What is that “honor”? Air. A trim reckoning.</p>

<p>Who hath it? He that died o’ Wednesday. Doth</p>

<p>he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No. ’Tis insensible,</p>

<p>then? Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the</p>

<p>living? No. Why? Detraction will not suffer it. Therefore,</p>

<p>I’ll none of it. Honor is a mere scutcheon. And</p>

<p>so ends my catechism.</p>
