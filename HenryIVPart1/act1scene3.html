<p><center><i>[Enter the King, Northumberland, Worcester, Hotspur,</p>

<p>and Sir Walter Blunt, with others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[to Northumberland, Worcester, and Hotspur]</i></p>

<p>My blood hath been too cold and temperate,</p>

<p>Unapt to stir at these indignities,</p>

<p>And you have found me, for accordingly</p>

<p>You tread upon my patience. But be sure</p>

<p>I will from henceforth rather be myself,</p>

<p>Mighty and to be feared, than my condition,</p>

<p>Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,</p>

<p>And therefore lost that title of respect</p>

<p>Which the proud soul ne’er pays but to the proud.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves</p>

<p>The scourge of greatness to be used on it,</p>

<p>And that same greatness too which our own hands</p>

<p>Have holp to make so portly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  My lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see</p>

<p>Danger and disobedience in thine eye.</p>

<p>O sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,</p>

<p>And majesty might never yet endure</p>

<p>The moody frontier of a servant brow.</p>

<p>You have good leave to leave us. When we need</p>

<p>Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Worcester exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>You were about to speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  Yea, my good lord.</p>

<p>Those prisoners in your Highness’ name demanded,</p>

<p>Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,</p>

<p>Were, as he says, not with such strength denied</p>

<p>As is delivered to your Majesty.</p>

<p>Either envy, therefore, or misprision</p>

<p>Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>My liege, I did deny no prisoners.</p>

<p>But I remember, when the fight was done,</p>

<p>When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,</p>

<p>Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,</p>

<p>Came there a certain lord, neat and trimly dressed,</p>

<p>Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reaped</p>

<p>Showed like a stubble land at harvest home.</p>

<p>He was perfumed like a milliner,</p>

<p>And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held</p>

<p>A pouncet box, which ever and anon</p>

<p>He gave his nose and took ’t away again,</p>

<p>Who therewith angry, when it next came there,</p>

<p>Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talked.</p>

<p>And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,</p>

<p>He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</p>

<p>To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse</p>

<p>Betwixt the wind and his nobility.</p>

<p>With many holiday and lady terms</p>

<p>He questioned me, amongst the rest demanded</p>

<p>My prisoners in your Majesty’s behalf.</p>

<p>I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,</p>

<p>To be so pestered with a popinjay,</p>

<p>Out of my grief and my impatience</p>

<p>Answered neglectingly I know not what–</p>

<p>He should, or he should not; for he made me mad</p>

<p>To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet</p>

<p>And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman</p>

<p>Of guns, and drums, and wounds–God save the</p>

<p>mark!–</p>

<p>And telling me the sovereignest thing on Earth</p>

<p>Was parmacety for an inward bruise,</p>

<p>And that it was great pity, so it was,</p>

<p>This villainous saltpeter should be digged</p>

<p>Out of the bowels of the harmless Earth,</p>

<p>Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed</p>

<p>So cowardly, and but for these vile guns</p>

<p>He would himself have been a soldier.</p>

<p>This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,</p>

<p>I answered indirectly, as I said,</p>

<p>And I beseech you, let not his report</p>

<p>Come current for an accusation</p>

<p>Betwixt my love and your high Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Blunt</span></p>

<p>The circumstance considered, good my lord,</p>

<p>Whate’er Lord Harry Percy then had said</p>

<p>To such a person and in such a place,</p>

<p>At such a time, with all the rest retold,</p>

<p>May reasonably die and never rise</p>

<p>To do him wrong or any way impeach</p>

<p>What then he said, so he unsay it now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,</p>

<p>But with proviso and exception</p>

<p>That we at our own charge shall ransom straight</p>

<p>His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,</p>

<p>Who, on my soul, hath willfully betrayed</p>

<p>The lives of those that he did lead to fight</p>

<p>Against that great magician, damned Glendower,</p>

<p>Whose daughter, as we hear, that Earl of March</p>

<p>Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then</p>

<p>Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?</p>

<p>Shall we buy treason and indent with fears</p>

<p>When they have lost and forfeited themselves?</p>

<p>No, on the barren mountains let him starve,</p>

<p>For I shall never hold that man my friend</p>

<p>Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost</p>

<p>To ransom home revolted Mortimer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  Revolted Mortimer!</p>

<p>He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,</p>

<p>But by the chance of war. To prove that true</p>

<p>Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,</p>

<p>Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took</p>

<p>When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank</p>

<p>In single opposition hand to hand</p>

<p>He did confound the best part of an hour</p>

<p>In changing hardiment with great Glendower.</p>

<p>Three times they breathed, and three times did they</p>

<p>drink,</p>

<p>Upon agreement, of swift Severn’s flood,</p>

<p>Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,</p>

<p>Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds</p>

<p>And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,</p>

<p>Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.</p>

<p>Never did bare and rotten policy</p>

<p>Color her working with such deadly wounds,</p>

<p>Nor never could the noble Mortimer</p>

<p>Receive so many, and all willingly.</p>

<p>Then let not him be slandered with revolt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Thou dost belie him, Percy; thou dost belie him.</p>

<p>He never did encounter with Glendower.</p>

<p>I tell thee, he durst as well have met the devil alone</p>

<p>As Owen Glendower for an enemy.</p>

<p>Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth</p>

<p>Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer.</p>

<p>Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,</p>

<p>Or you shall hear in such a kind from me</p>

<p>As will displease you.–My lord Northumberland,</p>

<p>We license your departure with your son.–</p>

<p>Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.</p>

<p><center><i>[King exits with Blunt and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>An if the devil come and roar for them,</p>

<p>I will not send them. I will after straight</p>

<p>And tell him so, for I will ease my heart,</p>

<p>Albeit I make a hazard of my head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>What, drunk with choler? Stay and pause awhile.</p>

<p>Here comes your uncle.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Worcester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  Speak of Mortimer?</p>

<p>Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul</p>

<p>Want mercy if I do not join with him.</p>

<p>Yea, on his part I’ll empty all these veins</p>

<p>And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,</p>

<p>But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer</p>

<p>As high in the air as this unthankful king,</p>

<p>As this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>Who struck this heat up after I was gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>He will forsooth have all my prisoners,</p>

<p>And when I urged the ransom once again</p>

<p>Of my wife’s brother, then his cheek looked pale,</p>

<p>And on my face he turned an eye of death,</p>

<p>Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>I cannot blame him. Was not he proclaimed</p>

<p>By Richard, that dead is, the next of blood?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>He was; I heard the proclamation.</p>

<p>And then it was when the unhappy king–</p>

<p>Whose wrongs in us God pardon!–did set forth</p>

<p>Upon his Irish expedition;</p>

<p>From whence he, intercepted, did return</p>

<p>To be deposed and shortly murdered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>And for whose death we in the world’s wide mouth</p>

<p>Live scandalized and foully spoken of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>But soft, I pray you. Did King Richard then</p>

<p>Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer</p>

<p>Heir to the crown?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  He did; myself did hear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Nay then, I cannot blame his cousin king</p>

<p>That wished him on the barren mountains starve.</p>

<p>But shall it be that you that set the crown</p>

<p>Upon the head of this forgetful man</p>

<p>And for his sake wear the detested blot</p>

<p>Of murderous subornation–shall it be</p>

<p>That you a world of curses undergo,</p>

<p>Being the agents or base second means,</p>

<p>The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?</p>

<p>O, pardon me that I descend so low</p>

<p>To show the line and the predicament</p>

<p>Wherein you range under this subtle king.</p>

<p>Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,</p>

<p>Or fill up chronicles in time to come,</p>

<p>That men of your nobility and power</p>

<p>Did gage them both in an unjust behalf</p>

<p>(As both of you, God pardon it, have done)</p>

<p>To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,</p>

<p>And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?</p>

<p>And shall it in more shame be further spoken</p>

<p>That you are fooled, discarded, and shook off</p>

<p>By him for whom these shames you underwent?</p>

<p>No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem</p>

<p>Your banished honors and restore yourselves</p>

<p>Into the good thoughts of the world again,</p>

<p>Revenge the jeering and disdained contempt</p>

<p>Of this proud king, who studies day and night</p>

<p>To answer all the debt he owes to you</p>

<p>Even with the bloody payment of your deaths.</p>

<p>Therefore I say–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span>  Peace, cousin, say no more.</p>

<p>And now I will unclasp a secret book,</p>

<p>And to your quick-conceiving discontents</p>

<p>I’ll read you matter deep and dangerous,</p>

<p>As full of peril and adventurous spirit</p>

<p>As to o’erwalk a current roaring loud</p>

<p>On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim!</p>

<p>Send danger from the east unto the west,</p>

<p>So honor cross it from the north to south,</p>

<p>And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs</p>

<p>To rouse a lion than to start a hare!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span> <i>[to Worcester]</i></p>

<p>Imagination of some great exploit</p>

<p>Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap</p>

<p>To pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,</p>

<p>Or dive into the bottom of the deep,</p>

<p>Where fathom line could never touch the ground,</p>

<p>And pluck up drowned honor by the locks,</p>

<p>So he that doth redeem her thence might wear</p>

<p>Without corrival all her dignities.</p>

<p>But out upon this half-faced fellowship!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>He apprehends a world of figures here,</p>

<p>But not the form of what he should attend.–</p>

<p>Good cousin, give me audience for a while.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>I cry you mercy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span>  Those same noble Scots</p>

<p>That are your prisoners–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  I’ll keep them all.</p>

<p>By God, he shall not have a Scot of them.</p>

<p>No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not.</p>

<p>I’ll keep them, by this hand!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span>  You start away</p>

<p>And lend no ear unto my purposes:</p>

<p>Those prisoners you shall keep–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  Nay, I will. That’s flat!</p>

<p>He said he would not ransom Mortimer,</p>

<p>Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer.</p>

<p>But I will find him when he lies asleep,</p>

<p>And in his ear I’ll hollo “Mortimer.”</p>

<p>Nay, I’ll have a starling shall be taught to speak</p>

<p>Nothing but “Mortimer,” and give it him</p>

<p>To keep his anger still in motion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span>  Hear you, cousin, a word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>All studies here I solemnly defy,</p>

<p>Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke.</p>

<p>And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales–</p>

<p>But that I think his father loves him not</p>

<p>And would be glad he met with some mischance–</p>

<p>I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>Farewell, kinsman. I’ll talk to you</p>

<p>When you are better tempered to attend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span> <i>[to Hotspur]</i></p>

<p>Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool</p>

<p>Art thou to break into this woman’s mood,</p>

<p>Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Why, look you, I am whipped and scourged with</p>

<p>rods,</p>

<p>Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear</p>

<p>Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.</p>

<p>In Richard’s time–what do you call the place?</p>

<p>A plague upon it! It is in Gloucestershire.</p>

<p>’Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,</p>

<p>His uncle York, where I first bowed my knee</p>

<p>Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke.</p>

<p>’Sblood, when you and he came back from</p>

<p>Ravenspurgh.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  At Berkeley Castle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  You say true.</p>

<p>Why, what a candy deal of courtesy</p>

<p>This fawning greyhound then did proffer me:</p>

<p>“Look when his infant fortune came to age,”</p>

<p>And “gentle Harry Percy,” and “kind cousin.”</p>

<p>O, the devil take such cozeners!–God forgive me!</p>

<p>Good uncle, tell your tale. I have done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>Nay, if you have not, to it again.</p>

<p>We will stay your leisure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  I have done, i’ faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>Then once more to your Scottish prisoners:</p>

<p>Deliver them up without their ransom straight,</p>

<p>And make the Douglas’ son your only mean</p>

<p>For powers in Scotland, which, for divers reasons</p>

<p>Which I shall send you written, be assured</p>

<p>Will easily be granted.–You, my lord,</p>

<p>Your son in Scotland being thus employed,</p>

<p>Shall secretly into the bosom creep</p>

<p>Of that same noble prelate well beloved,</p>

<p>The Archbishop.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  Of York, is it not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span>  True, who bears hard</p>

<p>His brother’s death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.</p>

<p>I speak not this in estimation,</p>

<p>As what I think might be, but what I know</p>

<p>Is ruminated, plotted, and set down,</p>

<p>And only stays but to behold the face</p>

<p>Of that occasion that shall bring it on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>I smell it. Upon my life it will do well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Before the game is afoot thou still let’st slip.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.</p>

<p>And then the power of Scotland and of York</p>

<p>To join with Mortimer, ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span>  And so they shall.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>In faith, it is exceedingly well aimed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>And ’tis no little reason bids us speed</p>

<p>To save our heads by raising of a head,</p>

<p>For bear ourselves as even as we can,</p>

<p>The King will always think him in our debt,</p>

<p>And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,</p>

<p>Till he hath found a time to pay us home.</p>

<p>And see already how he doth begin</p>

<p>To make us strangers to his looks of love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>He does, he does. We’ll be revenged on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>Cousin, farewell. No further go in this</p>

<p>Than I by letters shall direct your course.</p>

<p>When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,</p>

<p>I’ll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,</p>

<p>Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,</p>

<p>As I will fashion it, shall happily meet</p>

<p>To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,</p>

<p>Which now we hold at much uncertainty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Farewell, good brother. We shall thrive, I trust.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Uncle, adieu. O, let the hours be short</p>

<p>Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport.</p>
