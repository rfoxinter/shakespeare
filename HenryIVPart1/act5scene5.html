<p><center><i>[The trumpets sound. Enter the King, Prince of Wales,</p>

<p>Lord John of Lancaster, Earl of Westmoreland, with</p>

<p>Worcester and Vernon prisoners, and Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.–</p>

<p>Ill-spirited Worcester, did not we send grace,</p>

<p>Pardon, and terms of love to all of you?</p>

<p>And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary,</p>

<p>Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman’s trust?</p>

<p>Three knights upon our party slain today,</p>

<p>A noble earl, and many a creature else</p>

<p>Had been alive this hour</p>

<p>If, like a Christian, thou hadst truly borne</p>

<p>Betwixt our armies true intelligence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>What I have done my safety urged me to.</p>

<p>And I embrace this fortune patiently,</p>

<p>Since not to be avoided it falls on me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Bear Worcester to the death, and Vernon too.</p>

<p>Other offenders we will pause upon.</p>

<p><center><i>[Worcester and Vernon exit, under guard.]</i></center></p>

<p>How goes the field?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw</p>

<p>The fortune of the day quite turned from him,</p>

<p>The noble Percy slain, and all his men</p>

<p>Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest,</p>

<p>And, falling from a hill, he was so bruised</p>

<p>That the pursuers took him. At my tent</p>

<p>The Douglas is, and I beseech your Grace</p>

<p>I may dispose of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  With all my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you</p>

<p>This honorable bounty shall belong.</p>

<p>Go to the Douglas and deliver him</p>

<p>Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free.</p>

<p>His valors shown upon our crests today</p>

<p>Have taught us how to cherish such high deeds,</p>

<p>Even in the bosom of our adversaries.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancaster</span></p>

<p>I thank your Grace for this high courtesy,</p>

<p>Which I shall give away immediately.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Then this remains, that we divide our power.</p>

<p>You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland,</p>

<p>Towards York shall bend you with your dearest</p>

<p>speed</p>

<p>To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,</p>

<p>Who, as we hear, are busily in arms.</p>

<p>Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales</p>

<p>To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.</p>

<p>Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,</p>

<p>Meeting the check of such another day.</p>

<p>And since this business so fair is done,</p>

<p>Let us not leave till all our own be won.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
