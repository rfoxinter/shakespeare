<p><center><i>[Alarm, excursions. Enter the King, the Prince, Lord John</p>

<p>of Lancaster, and the Earl of Westmoreland.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>I prithee, Harry, withdraw thyself. Thou bleedest</p>

<p>too much.</p>

<p>Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancaster</sc></p>

<p>Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>I beseech your Majesty, make up,</p>

<p>Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>I will do so.–My Lord of Westmoreland,</p>

<p>Lead him to his tent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Westmoreland</sc></p>

<p>Come, my lord, I’ll lead you to your tent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help,</p>

<p>And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,</p>

<p>Where stained nobility lies trodden on,</p>

<p>And rebels’ arms triumph in massacres.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancaster</sc></p>

<p>We breathe too long. Come, cousin Westmoreland,</p>

<p>Our duty this way lies. For God’s sake, come.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lancaster and Westmoreland exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster.</p>

<p>I did not think thee lord of such a spirit.</p>

<p>Before, I loved thee as a brother, John,</p>

<p>But now I do respect thee as my soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point</p>

<p>With lustier maintenance than I did look for</p>

<p>Of such an ungrown warrior.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>O, this boy lends mettle to us all.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Douglas.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc></p>

<p>Another king! They grow like Hydra’s heads.–</p>

<p>I am the Douglas, fatal to all those</p>

<p>That wear those colors on them. What art thou</p>

<p>That counterfeit’st the person of a king?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>The King himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart,</p>

<p>So many of his shadows thou hast met</p>

<p>And not the very king. I have two boys</p>

<p>Seek Percy and thyself about the field,</p>

<p>But, seeing thou fall’st on me so luckily,</p>

<p>I will assay thee. And defend thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc></p>

<p>I fear thou art another counterfeit,</p>

<p>And yet, in faith, thou bearest thee like a king.</p>

<p>But mine I am sure thou art, whoe’er thou be,</p>

<p>And thus I win thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[They fight. The King being in danger,</p>

<p>enter Prince of Wales.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like</p>

<p>Never to hold it up again. The spirits</p>

<p>Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt are in my arms.</p>

<p>It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,</p>

<p>Who never promiseth but he means to pay.</p>

<p><center><i>[They fight. Douglas flieth.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To King.]</i> Cheerly, my lord. How fares your Grace?</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,</p>

<p>And so hath Clifton. I’ll to Clifton straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Stay and breathe awhile.</p>

<p>Thou hast redeemed thy lost opinion</p>

<p>And showed thou mak’st some tender of my life</p>

<p>In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>O God, they did me too much injury</p>

<p>That ever said I hearkened for your death.</p>

<p>If it were so, I might have let alone</p>

<p>The insulting hand of Douglas over you,</p>

<p>Which would have been as speedy in your end</p>

<p>As all the poisonous potions in the world,</p>

<p>And saved the treacherous labor of your son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Make up to Clifton. I’ll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.</p>

<p><center><i>[King exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hotspur.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Thou speak’st as if I would deny my name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>My name is Harry Percy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Why then I see</p>

<p>A very valiant rebel of the name.</p>

<p>I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,</p>

<p>To share with me in glory any more.</p>

<p>Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,</p>

<p>Nor can one England brook a double reign</p>

<p>Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>Nor shall it, Harry, for the hour is come</p>

<p>To end the one of us, and would to God</p>

<p>Thy name in arms were now as great as mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>I’ll make it greater ere I part from thee,</p>

<p>And all the budding honors on thy crest</p>

<p>I’ll crop to make a garland for my head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>I can no longer brook thy vanities.     <i><i>[They fight.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Falstaff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Well said, Hal! To it, Hal! Nay, you shall find</p>

<p>no boys’ play here, I can tell you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Douglas. He fighteth with Falstaff, who falls</p>

<p>down as if he were dead. Douglas exits. The Prince</p>

<p>killeth Percy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>O Harry, thou hast robbed me of my youth.</p>

<p>I better brook the loss of brittle life</p>

<p>Than those proud titles thou hast won of me.</p>

<p>They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my</p>

<p>flesh.</p>

<p>But thoughts, the slaves of life, and life, time’s fool,</p>

<p>And time, that takes survey of all the world,</p>

<p>Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,</p>

<p>But that the earthy and cold hand of death</p>

<p>Lies on my tongue. No, Percy, thou art dust,</p>

<p>And food for–     <i><i>[He dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>For worms, brave Percy. Fare thee well, great heart.</p>

<p>Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!</p>

<p>When that this body did contain a spirit,</p>

<p>A kingdom for it was too small a bound,</p>

<p>But now two paces of the vilest earth</p>

<p>Is room enough. This earth that bears thee dead</p>

<p>Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.</p>

<p>If thou wert sensible of courtesy,</p>

<p>I should not make so dear a show of zeal.</p>

<p>But let my favors hide thy mangled face;</p>

<p><center><i>[He covers Hotspur’s face.]</i></center></p>

<p>And even in thy behalf I’ll thank myself</p>

<p>For doing these fair rites of tenderness.</p>

<p>Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven.</p>

<p>Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,</p>

<p>But not remembered in thy epitaph.</p>

<p><center><i>[He spieth Falstaff on the ground.]</i></center></p>

<p>What, old acquaintance, could not all this flesh</p>

<p>Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell.</p>

<p>I could have better spared a better man.</p>

<p>O, I should have a heavy miss of thee</p>

<p>If I were much in love with vanity.</p>

<p>Death hath not struck so fat a deer today,</p>

<p>Though many dearer in this bloody fray.</p>

<p>Emboweled will I see thee by and by;</p>

<p>Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[Falstaff riseth up.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Emboweled? If thou embowel me today, I’ll</p>

<p>give you leave to powder me and eat me too</p>

<p>tomorrow. ’Sblood, ’twas time to counterfeit, or</p>

<p>that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot</p>

<p>too. Counterfeit? I lie. I am no counterfeit. To die is</p>

<p>to be a counterfeit, for he is but the counterfeit of a</p>

<p>man who hath not the life of a man; but to counterfeit</p>

<p>dying when a man thereby liveth is to be no</p>

<p>counterfeit, but the true and perfect image of life</p>

<p>indeed. The better part of valor is discretion, in the</p>

<p>which better part I have saved my life. Zounds, I am</p>

<p>afraid of this gunpowder Percy, though he be dead.</p>

<p>How if he should counterfeit too, and rise? By my</p>

<p>faith, I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.</p>

<p>Therefore I’ll make him sure, yea, and I’ll swear</p>

<p>I killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?</p>

<p>Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.</p>

<p>Therefore, sirrah, <i>[stabbing him]</i> with a new wound</p>

<p>in your thigh, come you along with me.</p>

<p><center><i>[He takes up Hotspur on his back.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Prince and John of Lancaster.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Come, brother John. Full bravely hast thou fleshed</p>

<p>Thy maiden sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancaster</sc>  But soft, whom have we here?</p>

<p>Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I did; I saw him dead,</p>

<p>Breathless and bleeding on the ground.–Art thou</p>

<p>alive?</p>

<p>Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?</p>

<p>I prithee, speak. We will not trust our eyes</p>

<p>Without our ears. Thou art not what thou seem’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  No, that’s certain. I am not a double man.</p>

<p>But if I be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a jack. There</p>

<p>is Percy. If your father will do me any honor, so; if</p>

<p>not, let him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be</p>

<p>either earl or duke, I can assure you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Why, Percy I killed myself, and saw thee dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is</p>

<p>given to lying. I grant you, I was down and out of</p>

<p>breath, and so was he, but we rose both at an instant</p>

<p>and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I</p>

<p>may be believed, so; if not, let them that should</p>

<p>reward valor bear the sin upon their own heads. I’ll</p>

<p>take it upon my death, I gave him this wound in</p>

<p>the thigh. If the man were alive and would deny</p>

<p>it, zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my</p>

<p>sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancaster</sc></p>

<p>This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>This is the strangest fellow, brother John.–</p>

<p>Come bring your luggage nobly on your back.</p>

<p>For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,</p>

<p>I’ll gild it with the happiest terms I have.</p>

<p><center><i>[A retreat is sounded.]</i></center></p>

<p>The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.</p>

<p>Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field</p>

<p>To see what friends are living, who are dead.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I’ll follow, as they say, for reward. He that</p>

<p>rewards me, God reward him. If I do grow great,</p>

<p>I’ll grow less, for I’ll purge and leave sack and live</p>

<p>cleanly as a nobleman should do.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits carrying Hotspur’s body.]</i></center></p>
