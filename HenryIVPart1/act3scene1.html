<p><center><i>[Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Lord Mortimer, and Owen</p>

<p>Glendower.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>These promises are fair, the parties sure,</p>

<p>And our induction full of prosperous hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower,</p>

<p>Will you sit down? And uncle Worcester–</p>

<p>A plague upon it, I have forgot the map.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>No, here it is. Sit, cousin Percy,</p>

<p>Sit, good cousin Hotspur, for by that name</p>

<p>As oft as Lancaster doth speak of you</p>

<p>His cheek looks pale, and with a rising sigh</p>

<p>He wisheth you in heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  And you in hell,</p>

<p>As oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>I cannot blame him. At my nativity</p>

<p>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</p>

<p>Of burning cressets, and at my birth</p>

<p>The frame and huge foundation of the Earth</p>

<p>Shaked like a coward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  Why, so it would have done</p>

<p>At the same season if your mother’s cat</p>

<p>Had but kittened, though yourself had never been</p>

<p>born.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>I say the Earth did shake when I was born.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>And I say the Earth was not of my mind,</p>

<p>If you suppose as fearing you it shook.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>The heavens were all on fire; the Earth did tremble.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>O, then the Earth shook to see the heavens on fire,</p>

<p>And not in fear of your nativity.</p>

<p>Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth</p>

<p>In strange eruptions; oft the teeming Earth</p>

<p>Is with a kind of colic pinched and vexed</p>

<p>By the imprisoning of unruly wind</p>

<p>Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving,</p>

<p>Shakes the old beldam Earth and topples down</p>

<p>Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth</p>

<p>Our grandam Earth, having this distemp’rature,</p>

<p>In passion shook.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span>  Cousin, of many men</p>

<p>I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave</p>

<p>To tell you once again that at my birth</p>

<p>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</p>

<p>The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds</p>

<p>Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.</p>

<p>These signs have marked me extraordinary,</p>

<p>And all the courses of my life do show</p>

<p>I am not in the roll of common men.</p>

<p>Where is he living, clipped in with the sea</p>

<p>That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,</p>

<p>Which calls me pupil or hath read to me?</p>

<p>And bring him out that is but woman’s son</p>

<p>Can trace me in the tedious ways of art</p>

<p>And hold me pace in deep experiments.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>I think there’s no man speaks better Welsh.</p>

<p>I’ll to dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>Peace, cousin Percy. You will make him mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>I can call spirits from the vasty deep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Why, so can I, or so can any man,</p>

<p>But will they come when you do call for them?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the</p>

<p>devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil</p>

<p>By telling truth. Tell truth and shame the devil.</p>

<p>If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,</p>

<p>And I’ll be sworn I have power to shame him</p>

<p>hence.</p>

<p>O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head</p>

<p>Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye</p>

<p>And sandy-bottomed Severn have I sent him</p>

<p>Bootless home and weather-beaten back.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Home without boots, and in foul weather too!</p>

<p>How ’scapes he agues, in the devil’s name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>Come, here is the map. Shall we divide our right</p>

<p>According to our threefold order ta’en?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>The Archdeacon hath divided it</p>

<p>Into three limits very equally:</p>

<p>England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,</p>

<p>By south and east is to my part assigned;</p>

<p>All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,</p>

<p>And all the fertile land within that bound</p>

<p>To Owen Glendower; and, dear coz, to you</p>

<p>The remnant northward lying off from Trent.</p>

<p>And our indentures tripartite are drawn,</p>

<p>Which being sealed interchangeably–</p>

<p>A business that this night may execute–</p>

<p>Tomorrow, cousin Percy, you and I</p>

<p>And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth</p>

<p>To meet your father and the Scottish power,</p>

<p>As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>My father Glendower is not ready yet,</p>

<p>Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days.</p>

<p><i>[To Glendower.]</i> Within that space you may have</p>

<p>drawn together</p>

<p>Your tenants, friends, and neighboring gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>A shorter time shall send me to you, lords,</p>

<p>And in my conduct shall your ladies come,</p>

<p>From whom you now must steal and take no leave,</p>

<p>For there will be a world of water shed</p>

<p>Upon the parting of your wives and you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span> <i>[looking at the map]</i></p>

<p>Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,</p>

<p>In quantity equals not one of yours.</p>

<p>See how this river comes me cranking in</p>

<p>And cuts me from the best of all my land</p>

<p>A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.</p>

<p>I’ll have the current in this place dammed up,</p>

<p>And here the smug and silver Trent shall run</p>

<p>In a new channel, fair and evenly.</p>

<p>It shall not wind with such a deep indent</p>

<p>To rob me of so rich a bottom here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>Not wind? It shall, it must. You see it doth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span> <i>[to Hotspur]</i></p>

<p>Yea, but mark how he bears his course, and runs</p>

<p>me up</p>

<p>With like advantage on the other side,</p>

<p>Gelding the opposed continent as much</p>

<p>As on the other side it takes from you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span></p>

<p>Yea, but a little charge will trench him here</p>

<p>And on this north side win this cape of land,</p>

<p>And then he runs straight and even.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>I’ll have it so. A little charge will do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span>  I’ll not have it altered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  Will not you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span>  No, nor you shall not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  Who shall say me nay?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span>  Why, that will I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>I can speak English, lord, as well as you,</p>

<p>For I was trained up in the English court,</p>

<p>Where being but young I framed to the harp</p>

<p>Many an English ditty lovely well</p>

<p>And gave the tongue a helpful ornament–</p>

<p>A virtue that was never seen in you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Marry, and I am glad of it with all my heart.</p>

<p>I had rather be a kitten and cry “mew”</p>

<p>Than one of these same meter balladmongers.</p>

<p>I had rather hear a brazen can’stick turned,</p>

<p>Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree,</p>

<p>And that would set my teeth nothing an edge,</p>

<p>Nothing so much as mincing poetry.</p>

<p>’Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span>  Come, you shall have Trent turned.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>I do not care. I’ll give thrice so much land</p>

<p>To any well-deserving friend;</p>

<p>But in the way of bargain, mark you me,</p>

<p>I’ll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.</p>

<p>Are the indentures drawn? Shall we be gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>The moon shines fair. You may away by night.</p>

<p>I’ll haste the writer, and withal</p>

<p>Break with your wives of your departure hence.</p>

<p>I am afraid my daughter will run mad,</p>

<p>So much she doteth on her Mortimer.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>Fie, cousin Percy, how you cross my father!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>I cannot choose. Sometime he angers me</p>

<p>With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant,</p>

<p>Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,</p>

<p>And of a dragon and a finless fish,</p>

<p>A clip-winged griffin and a moulten raven,</p>

<p>A couching lion and a ramping cat,</p>

<p>And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff</p>

<p>As puts me from my faith. I tell you what–</p>

<p>He held me last night at least nine hours</p>

<p>In reckoning up the several devils’ names</p>

<p>That were his lackeys. I cried “Hum,” and “Well, go</p>

<p>to,”</p>

<p>But marked him not a word. O, he is as tedious</p>

<p>As a tired horse, a railing wife,</p>

<p>Worse than a smoky house. I had rather live</p>

<p>With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,</p>

<p>Than feed on cates and have him talk to me</p>

<p>In any summer house in Christendom.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,</p>

<p>Exceedingly well read and profited</p>

<p>In strange concealments, valiant as a lion,</p>

<p>And wondrous affable, and as bountiful</p>

<p>As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?</p>

<p>He holds your temper in a high respect</p>

<p>And curbs himself even of his natural scope</p>

<p>When you come cross his humor. Faith, he does.</p>

<p>I warrant you that man is not alive</p>

<p>Might so have tempted him as you have done</p>

<p>Without the taste of danger and reproof.</p>

<p>But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Worcester</span> <i>[to Hotspur]</i></p>

<p>In faith, my lord, you are too willful-blame,</p>

<p>And, since your coming hither, have done enough</p>

<p>To put him quite besides his patience.</p>

<p>You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault.</p>

<p>Though sometimes it show greatness, courage,</p>

<p>blood–</p>

<p>And that’s the dearest grace it renders you–</p>

<p>Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,</p>

<p>Defect of manners, want of government,</p>

<p>Pride, haughtiness, opinion, and disdain,</p>

<p>The least of which, haunting a nobleman,</p>

<p>Loseth men’s hearts and leaves behind a stain</p>

<p>Upon the beauty of all parts besides,</p>

<p>Beguiling them of commendation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Well, I am schooled. Good manners be your speed!</p>

<p>Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Glendower with the Ladies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>This is the deadly spite that angers me:</p>

<p>My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>My daughter weeps; she’ll not part with you.</p>

<p>She’ll be a soldier too, she’ll to the wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy</p>

<p>Shall follow in your conduct speedily.</p>

<p><center><i>[Glendower speaks to her in Welsh,</p>

<p>and she answers him in the same.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>She is desperate here, a peevish self-willed harlotry,</p>

<p>One that no persuasion can do good upon.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Lady speaks in Welsh.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>I understand thy looks. That pretty Welsh</p>

<p>Which thou pourest down from these swelling</p>

<p>heavens</p>

<p>I am too perfect in, and but for shame</p>

<p>In such a parley should I answer thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Lady speaks again in Welsh. They kiss.]</i></center></p>

<p>I understand thy kisses, and thou mine,</p>

<p>And that’s a feeling disputation;</p>

<p>But I will never be a truant, love,</p>

<p>Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue</p>

<p>Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penned,</p>

<p>Sung by a fair queen in a summer’s bower,</p>

<p>With ravishing division, to her lute.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Lady speaks again in Welsh.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>O, I am ignorance itself in this!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down</p>

<p>And rest your gentle head upon her lap,</p>

<p>And she will sing the song that pleaseth you,</p>

<p>And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep,</p>

<p>Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,</p>

<p>Making such difference ’twixt wake and sleep</p>

<p>As is the difference betwixt day and night</p>

<p>The hour before the heavenly harnessed team</p>

<p>Begins his golden progress in the east.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>With all my heart I’ll sit and hear her sing.</p>

<p>By that time will our book, I think, be drawn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>Do so, and those musicians that shall play to you</p>

<p>Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,</p>

<p>And straight they shall be here. Sit and attend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down.</p>

<p>Come, quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy</p>

<p>lap.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Percy</span>  Go, you giddy goose.</p>

<p><center><i>[The music plays.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span></p>

<p>Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh,</p>

<p>And ’tis no marvel he is so humorous.</p>

<p>By ’r Lady, he is a good musician.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Percy</span>  Then should you be nothing but musical,</p>

<p>for you are altogether governed by humors. Lie</p>

<p>still, you thief, and hear the lady sing in Welsh.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in</p>

<p>Irish.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Percy</span>  Wouldst thou have thy head broken?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Percy</span>  Then be still.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  Neither; ’tis a woman’s fault.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Percy</span>  Now God help thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  To the Welsh lady’s bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Percy</span>  What’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  Peace, she sings.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here the Lady sings a Welsh song.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  Come, Kate, I’ll have your song too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Percy</span>  Not mine, in good sooth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  Not yours, in good sooth! Heart, you swear</p>

<p>like a comfit-maker’s wife! “Not you, in good</p>

<p>sooth,” and “as true as I live,” and “as God shall</p>

<p>mend me,” and “as sure as day”–</p>

<p>And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths</p>

<p>As if thou never walk’st further than Finsbury.</p>

<p>Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,</p>

<p>A good mouth-filling oath, and leave “in sooth,”</p>

<p>And such protest of pepper-gingerbread</p>

<p>To velvet-guards and Sunday citizens.</p>

<p>Come, sing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Percy</span>  I will not sing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hotspur</span>  ’Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be redbreast</p>

<p>teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I’ll</p>

<p>away within these two hours, and so come in when</p>

<p>you will.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glendower</span></p>

<p>Come, come, Lord Mortimer, you are as slow</p>

<p>As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.</p>

<p>By this our book is drawn. We’ll but seal,</p>

<p>And then to horse immediately.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span>  With all my heart.</p>
