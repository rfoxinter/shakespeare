<p><center><i>[Enter Hotspur, Worcester, and Douglas.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>Well said, my noble Scot. If speaking truth</p>

<p>In this fine age were not thought flattery,</p>

<p>Such attribution should the Douglas have</p>

<p>As not a soldier of this season’s stamp</p>

<p>Should go so general current through the world.</p>

<p>By God, I cannot flatter. I do defy</p>

<p>The tongues of soothers. But a braver place</p>

<p>In my heart’s love hath no man than yourself.</p>

<p>Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc>  Thou art the king of honor.</p>

<p>No man so potent breathes upon the ground</p>

<p>But I will beard him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  Do so, and ’tis well.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger with letters.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>What letters hast thou there? <i>[To Douglas.]</i> I can but</p>

<p>thank you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  These letters come from your father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>Letters from him! Why comes he not himself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>He cannot come, my lord. He is grievous sick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>Zounds, how has he the leisure to be sick</p>

<p>In such a justling time? Who leads his power?</p>

<p>Under whose government come they along?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc> <i>[handing letter to Hotspur, who begins</p>

<p>reading it]</i></p>

<p>His letters bears his mind, not I, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Worcester</sc></p>

<p>I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,</p>

<p>And, at the time of my departure thence,</p>

<p>He was much feared by his physicians.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Worcester</sc></p>

<p>I would the state of time had first been whole</p>

<p>Ere he by sickness had been visited.</p>

<p>His health was never better worth than now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>Sick now? Droop now? This sickness doth infect</p>

<p>The very lifeblood of our enterprise.</p>

<p>’Tis catching hither, even to our camp.</p>

<p>He writes me here that inward sickness–</p>

<p>And that his friends by deputation</p>

<p>Could not so soon be drawn, nor did he think it</p>

<p>meet</p>

<p>To lay so dangerous and dear a trust</p>

<p>On any soul removed but on his own;</p>

<p>Yet doth he give us bold advertisement</p>

<p>That with our small conjunction we should on</p>

<p>To see how fortune is disposed to us,</p>

<p>For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,</p>

<p>Because the King is certainly possessed</p>

<p>Of all our purposes. What say you to it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Worcester</sc></p>

<p>Your father’s sickness is a maim to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>A perilous gash, a very limb lopped off!</p>

<p>And yet, in faith, it is not. His present want</p>

<p>Seems more than we shall find it. Were it good</p>

<p>To set the exact wealth of all our states</p>

<p>All at one cast? To set so rich a main</p>

<p>On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?</p>

<p>It were not good, for therein should we read</p>

<p>The very bottom and the soul of hope,</p>

<p>The very list, the very utmost bound</p>

<p>Of all our fortunes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc></p>

<p>Faith, and so we should, where now remains</p>

<p>A sweet reversion. We may boldly spend</p>

<p>Upon the hope of what is to come in.</p>

<p>A comfort of retirement lives in this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>A rendezvous, a home to fly unto,</p>

<p>If that the devil and mischance look big</p>

<p>Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Worcester</sc></p>

<p>But yet I would your father had been here.</p>

<p>The quality and hair of our attempt</p>

<p>Brooks no division. It will be thought</p>

<p>By some that know not why he is away</p>

<p>That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike</p>

<p>Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence.</p>

<p>And think how such an apprehension</p>

<p>May turn the tide of fearful faction</p>

<p>And breed a kind of question in our cause.</p>

<p>For well you know, we of the off’ring side</p>

<p>Must keep aloof from strict arbitrament,</p>

<p>And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence</p>

<p>The eye of reason may pry in upon us.</p>

<p>This absence of your father’s draws a curtain</p>

<p>That shows the ignorant a kind of fear</p>

<p>Before not dreamt of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  You strain too far.</p>

<p>I rather of his absence make this use:</p>

<p>It lends a luster and more great opinion,</p>

<p>A larger dare, to our great enterprise</p>

<p>Than if the Earl were here, for men must think</p>

<p>If we without his help can make a head</p>

<p>To push against a kingdom, with his help</p>

<p>We shall o’erturn it topsy-turvy down.</p>

<p>Yet all goes well; yet all our joints are whole.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc></p>

<p>As heart can think. There is not such a word</p>

<p>Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Richard Vernon.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vernon</sc></p>

<p>Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.</p>

<p>The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,</p>

<p>Is marching hitherwards, with him Prince John.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>No harm, what more?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vernon</sc>  And further I have learned</p>

<p>The King himself in person is set forth,</p>

<p>Or hitherwards intended speedily,</p>

<p>With strong and mighty preparation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,</p>

<p>The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,</p>

<p>And his comrades, that daffed the world aside</p>

<p>And bid it pass?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vernon</sc>  All furnished, all in arms,</p>

<p>All plumed like estridges that with the wind</p>

<p>Bated like eagles having lately bathed,</p>

<p>Glittering in golden coats like images,</p>

<p>As full of spirit as the month of May,</p>

<p>And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer,</p>

<p>Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.</p>

<p>I saw young Harry with his beaver on,</p>

<p>His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly armed,</p>

<p>Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury</p>

<p>And vaulted with such ease into his seat</p>

<p>As if an angel dropped down from the clouds,</p>

<p>To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus</p>

<p>And witch the world with noble horsemanship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>No more, no more! Worse than the sun in March</p>

<p>This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come.</p>

<p>They come like sacrifices in their trim,</p>

<p>And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war</p>

<p>All hot and bleeding will we offer them.</p>

<p>The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit</p>

<p>Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire</p>

<p>To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh</p>

<p>And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,</p>

<p>Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt</p>

<p>Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,</p>

<p>Meet and ne’er part till one drop down a corse.</p>

<p>O, that Glendower were come!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vernon</sc>  There is more news.</p>

<p>I learned in Worcester, as I rode along,</p>

<p>He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc></p>

<p>That’s the worst tidings that I hear of yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Worcester</sc></p>

<p>Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>What may the King’s whole battle reach unto?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vernon</sc></p>

<p>To thirty thousand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  Forty let it be.</p>

<p>My father and Glendower being both away,</p>

<p>The powers of us may serve so great a day.</p>

<p>Come, let us take a muster speedily.</p>

<p>Doomsday is near. Die all, die merrily.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Douglas</sc></p>

<p>Talk not of dying. I am out of fear</p>

<p>Of death or death’s hand for this one half year.</p>
