<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be</p>

<p>well contented to be there, in respect of the love I</p>

<p>bear your house. He could be contented; why is he</p>

<p>not, then? In respect of the love he bears our</p>

<p>house–he shows in this he loves his own barn</p>

<p>better than he loves our house. Let me see some</p>

<p>more. The purpose you undertake is dangerous.</p>

<p>Why, that’s certain. ’Tis dangerous to take a cold,</p>

<p>to sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my Lord Fool, out</p>

<p>of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety.</p>

<p>The purpose you undertake is dangerous, the friends</p>

<p>you have named uncertain, the time itself unsorted,</p>

<p>and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise</p>

<p>of so great an opposition. Say you so, say you so?</p>

<p>I say unto you again, you are a shallow, cowardly</p>

<p>hind, and you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By</p>

<p>the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid,</p>

<p>our friends true and constant–a good plot,</p>

<p>good friends, and full of expectation; an excellent</p>

<p>plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited</p>

<p>rogue is this! Why, my Lord of York commends</p>

<p>the plot and the general course of the action.</p>

<p>Zounds, an I were now by this rascal, I could brain</p>

<p>him with his lady’s fan. Is there not my father, my</p>

<p>uncle, and myself, Lord Edmund Mortimer, my</p>

<p>Lord of York, and Owen Glendower? Is there not</p>

<p>besides the Douglas? Have I not all their letters to</p>

<p>meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month,</p>

<p>and are they not some of them set forward already?</p>

<p>What a pagan rascal is this–an infidel! Ha, you</p>

<p>shall see now, in very sincerity of fear and cold</p>

<p>heart, will he to the King and lay open all our</p>

<p>proceedings. O, I could divide myself and go to</p>

<p>buffets for moving such a dish of skim milk with so</p>

<p>honorable an action! Hang him, let him tell the</p>

<p>King. We are prepared. I will set forward tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter his Lady.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Kate? I must leave you within these two</p>

<p>hours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Percy</sc></p>

<p>O my good lord, why are you thus alone?</p>

<p>For what offense have I this fortnight been</p>

<p>A banished woman from my Harry’s bed?</p>

<p>Tell me, sweet lord, what is ’t that takes from thee</p>

<p>Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?</p>

<p>Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth</p>

<p>And start so often when thou sit’st alone?</p>

<p>Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks</p>

<p>And given my treasures and my rights of thee</p>

<p>To thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy?</p>

<p>In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watched,</p>

<p>And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,</p>

<p>Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed,</p>

<p>Cry “Courage! To the field!” And thou hast talked</p>

<p>Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,</p>

<p>Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,</p>

<p>Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,</p>

<p>Of prisoners’ ransom, and of soldiers slain,</p>

<p>And all the currents of a heady fight.</p>

<p>Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war,</p>

<p>And thus hath so bestirred thee in thy sleep,</p>

<p>That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow</p>

<p>Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream,</p>

<p>And in thy face strange motions have appeared,</p>

<p>Such as we see when men restrain their breath</p>

<p>On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are</p>

<p>these?</p>

<p>Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,</p>

<p>And I must know it, else he loves me not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>What, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Is Gilliams with the packet gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  He is, my lord, an hour ago.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>One horse, my lord, he brought even now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>What horse? A roan, a crop-ear, is it not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>It is, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  That roan shall be my throne.</p>

<p>Well, I will back him straight. O, Esperance!</p>

<p>Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.</p>

<p><center><i>[Servant exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Percy</sc>  But hear you, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  What say’st thou, my lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Percy</sc>  What is it carries you away?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  Why, my horse, my love, my horse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Percy</sc>  Out, you mad-headed ape!</p>

<p>A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen</p>

<p>As you are tossed with. In faith,</p>

<p>I’ll know your business, Harry, that I will.</p>

<p>I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir</p>

<p>About his title, and hath sent for you</p>

<p>To line his enterprise; but if you go–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Percy</sc></p>

<p>Come, come, you paraquito, answer me</p>

<p>Directly unto this question that I ask.</p>

<p>In faith, I’ll break thy little finger, Harry,</p>

<p>An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  Away!</p>

<p>Away, you trifler. Love, I love thee not.</p>

<p>I care not for thee, Kate. This is no world</p>

<p>To play with mammets and to tilt with lips.</p>

<p>We must have bloody noses and cracked crowns,</p>

<p>And pass them current too.–Gods me, my horse!–</p>

<p>What say’st thou, Kate? What wouldst thou have</p>

<p>with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Percy</sc></p>

<p>Do you not love me? Do you not indeed?</p>

<p>Well, do not then, for since you love me not,</p>

<p>I will not love myself. Do you not love me?</p>

<p>Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc>  Come, wilt thou see me ride?</p>

<p>And when I am a-horseback I will swear</p>

<p>I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate,</p>

<p>I must not have you henceforth question me</p>

<p>Whither I go, nor reason whereabout.</p>

<p>Whither I must, I must; and to conclude</p>

<p>This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.</p>

<p>I know you wise, but yet no farther wise</p>

<p>Than Harry Percy’s wife; constant you are,</p>

<p>But yet a woman; and for secrecy</p>

<p>No lady closer, for I well believe</p>

<p>Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know,</p>

<p>And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Percy</sc>  How? So far?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hotspur</sc></p>

<p>Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate,</p>

<p>Whither I go, thither shall you go too.</p>

<p>Today will I set forth, tomorrow you.</p>

<p>Will this content you, Kate?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Percy</sc>  It must, of force.</p>
