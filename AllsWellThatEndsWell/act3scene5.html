<p><center><i>[A tucket afar off. Enter old Widow of Florence, her</p>

<p>daughter Diana, and Mariana, with other Citizens.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc>  Nay, come, for if they do approach the city, we</p>

<p>shall lose all the sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  They say the French count has done most honorable</p>

<p>service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc>  It is reported that he has taken their great’st</p>

<p>commander, and that with his own hand he slew</p>

<p>the Duke’s brother. <i>[A trumpet sounds.]</i> We have</p>

<p>lost our labor. They are gone a contrary way. Hark,</p>

<p>you may know by their trumpets.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  Come, let’s return again and suffice ourselves</p>

<p>with the report of it.–Well, Diana, take heed of</p>

<p>this French earl. The honor of a maid is her name,</p>

<p>and no legacy is so rich as honesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc> <i>[to Diana]</i>  I have told my neighbor how you</p>

<p>have been solicited by a gentleman, his</p>

<p>companion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  I know that knave, hang him! One Parolles, a</p>

<p>filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the</p>

<p>young earl.–Beware of them, Diana. Their promises,</p>

<p>enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these</p>

<p>engines of lust are not the things they go under.</p>

<p>Many a maid hath been seduced by them; and</p>

<p>the misery is example that so terrible shows in the</p>

<p>wrack of maidenhood cannot for all that dissuade</p>

<p>succession, but that they are limed with the twigs</p>

<p>that threatens them. I hope I need not to advise</p>

<p>you further, but I hope your own grace will keep</p>

<p>you where you are, though there were no further</p>

<p>danger known but the modesty which is so lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  You shall not need to fear me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc>  I hope so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Helen as a pilgrim.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie at</p>

<p>my house; thither they send one another. I’ll question</p>

<p>her.–God save you, pilgrim. Whither are</p>

<p>bound?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  To Saint Jaques le Grand.</p>

<p>Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc></p>

<p>At the Saint Francis here beside the port.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  Is this the way?     <i><i>[A march afar.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc></p>

<p>Ay, marry, is ’t.–Hark you, they come this way.–</p>

<p>If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,</p>

<p>But till the troops come by,</p>

<p>I will conduct you where you shall be lodged,</p>

<p>The rather for I think I know your hostess</p>

<p>As ample as myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  Is it yourself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc>  If you shall please so, pilgrim.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i></p>

<p>I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc></p>

<p>You came I think from France?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  I did so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc></p>

<p>Here you shall see a countryman of yours</p>

<p>That has done worthy service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  His name, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>The Count Rossillion. Know you such a one?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i></p>

<p>But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him.</p>

<p>His face I know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  Whatsome’er he is,</p>

<p>He’s bravely taken here. He stole from France,</p>

<p>As ’tis reported, for the King had married him</p>

<p>Against his liking. Think you it is so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i></p>

<p>Ay, surely, mere the truth. I know his lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>There is a gentleman that serves the Count</p>

<p>Reports but coarsely of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  What’s his name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>Monsieur Parolles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  O, I believe with him.</p>

<p>In argument of praise, or to the worth</p>

<p>Of the great count himself, she is too mean</p>

<p>To have her name repeated. All her deserving</p>

<p>Is a reserved honesty, and that</p>

<p>I have not heard examined.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  Alas, poor lady,</p>

<p>’Tis a hard bondage to become the wife</p>

<p>Of a detesting lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc></p>

<p>I warrant, good creature, wheresoe’er she is,</p>

<p>Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do</p>

<p>her</p>

<p>A shrewd turn if she pleased.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  How do you mean?</p>

<p>Maybe the amorous count solicits her</p>

<p>In the unlawful purpose?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc>  He does indeed,</p>

<p>And brokes with all that can in such a suit</p>

<p>Corrupt the tender honor of a maid,</p>

<p>But she is armed for him and keeps her guard</p>

<p>In honestest defense.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc></p>

<p>The gods forbid else!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Drum and Colors. Enter Bertram Count Rossillion,</p>

<p>Parolles, and the whole Army.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc>  So, now they come.</p>

<p>That is Antonio, the Duke’s eldest son;</p>

<p>That, Escalus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  Which is the Frenchman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  He,</p>

<p>That with the plume. ’Tis a most gallant fellow.</p>

<p>I would he loved his wife. If he were honester,</p>

<p>He were much goodlier. Is ’t not a handsome</p>

<p>gentleman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  I like him well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>’Tis pity he is not honest. Yond’s that same knave</p>

<p>That leads him to these places. Were I his lady,</p>

<p>I would poison that vile rascal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  Which is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>That jackanapes with scarves. Why is he melancholy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  Perchance he’s hurt i’ th’ battle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Lose our drum? Well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  He’s shrewdly vexed at something. Look, he</p>

<p>has spied us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc> <i>[to Parolles]</i>  Marry, hang you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc> <i>[to Parolles]</i>  And your courtesy, for a</p>

<p>ring-carrier.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bertram, Parolles, and the army exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc></p>

<p>The troop is passed. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you</p>

<p>Where you shall host. Of enjoined penitents</p>

<p>There’s four or five, to Great Saint Jaques bound,</p>

<p>Already at my house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[as pilgrim]</i>  I humbly thank you.</p>

<p>Please it this matron and this gentle maid</p>

<p>To eat with us tonight, the charge and thanking</p>

<p>Shall be for me. And to requite you further,</p>

<p>I will bestow some precepts of this virgin</p>

<p>Worthy the note.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>  We’ll take your offer kindly.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
