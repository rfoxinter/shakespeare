<p><center><i>[Enter Countess and Steward, with a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Alas! And would you take the letter of her?</p>

<p>Might you not know she would do as she has done</p>

<p>By sending me a letter? Read it again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Steward</sc> <i>[reads the letter]</i></p>

<p>     <i>I am Saint Jaques’ pilgrim, thither gone.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Ambitious love hath so in me offended</i></p>

<p>     <i>That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,</i></p>

<p>        <i>With sainted vow my faults to have amended.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Write, write, that from the bloody course of war</i></p>

<p>        <i>My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far</i></p>

<p>        <i>His name with zealous fervor sanctify.</i></p>

<p>     <i>His taken labors bid him me forgive;</i></p>

<p>        <i>I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth</i></p>

<p>     <i>From courtly friends, with camping foes to live</i></p>

<p>        <i>Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.</i></p>

<p>     <i>He is too good and fair for death and me,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Whom I myself embrace to set him free.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!</p>

<p>Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much</p>

<p>As letting her pass so. Had I spoke with her,</p>

<p>I could have well diverted her intents,</p>

<p>Which thus she hath prevented.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Steward</sc>  Pardon me, madam.</p>

<p>If I had given you this at overnight,</p>

<p>She might have been o’erta’en. And yet she writes</p>

<p>Pursuit would be but vain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  What angel shall</p>

<p>Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive</p>

<p>Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear</p>

<p>And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath</p>

<p>Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,</p>

<p>To this unworthy husband of his wife.</p>

<p>Let every word weigh heavy of her worth</p>

<p>That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,</p>

<p>Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.</p>

<p>Dispatch the most convenient messenger.</p>

<p>When haply he shall hear that she is gone,</p>

<p>He will return; and hope I may that she,</p>

<p>Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,</p>

<p>Led hither by pure love. Which of them both</p>

<p>Is dearest to me, I have no skill in sense</p>

<p>To make distinction. Provide this messenger.</p>

<p>My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak.</p>

<p>Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.</p>
