<p><center><i>[Enter Fool, Countess, and Lafew.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  No, no, no, your son was misled with a</p>

<p>snipped-taffeta fellow there, whose villainous saffron</p>

<p>would have made all the unbaked and doughy</p>

<p>youth of a nation in his color. Your daughter-in-law</p>

<p>had been alive at this hour, and your son here</p>

<p>at home, more advanced by the King than by that</p>

<p>red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  I would I had not known him. It was the</p>

<p>death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever</p>

<p>nature had praise for creating. If she had partaken</p>

<p>of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a</p>

<p>mother, I could not have owed her a more rooted</p>

<p>love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  ’Twas a good lady, ’twas a good lady. We may</p>

<p>pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another</p>

<p>herb.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the</p>

<p>salad, or rather the herb of grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  They are not herbs, you knave. They are</p>

<p>nose-herbs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir. I have not</p>

<p>much skill in grass.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a</p>

<p>fool?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  A fool, sir, at a woman’s service, and a knave at a</p>

<p>man’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Your distinction?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I would cozen the man of his wife and do his</p>

<p>service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  So you were a knave at his service indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do</p>

<p>her service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave</p>

<p>and fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  At your service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  No, no, no.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as</p>

<p>great a prince as you are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Who’s that, a Frenchman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Faith, sir, he has an English name, but his</p>

<p>phys’nomy is more hotter in France than there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  What prince is that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  The black prince, sir, alias the prince of darkness,</p>

<p>alias the devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span> <i>[giving him money]</i>  Hold thee, there’s my</p>

<p>purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy</p>

<p>master thou talk’st of. Serve him still.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a</p>

<p>great fire, and the master I speak of ever keeps a</p>

<p>good fire. But sure he is the prince of the world; let</p>

<p>his Nobility remain in ’s court. I am for the house</p>

<p>with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little</p>

<p>for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves</p>

<p>may, but the many will be too chill and tender, and</p>

<p>they’ll be for the flow’ry way that leads to the</p>

<p>broad gate and the great fire.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Go thy ways. I begin to be aweary of thee. And</p>

<p>I tell thee so before because I would not fall out</p>

<p>with thee. Go thy ways. Let my horses be well</p>

<p>looked to, without any tricks.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  If I put any tricks upon ’em, sir, they shall be</p>

<p>jades’ tricks, which are their own right by the law</p>

<p>of nature.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  A shrewd knave and an unhappy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  So he is. My lord that’s gone made himself</p>

<p>much sport out of him. By his authority he</p>

<p>remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his</p>

<p>sauciness, and indeed he has no pace, but runs</p>

<p>where he will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  I like him well. ’Tis not amiss. And I was about</p>

<p>to tell you, since I heard of the good lady’s death</p>

<p>and that my lord your son was upon his return</p>

<p>home, I moved the King my master to speak in the</p>

<p>behalf of my daughter, which in the minority of</p>

<p>them both his Majesty out of a self-gracious</p>

<p>remembrance did first propose. His Highness hath</p>

<p>promised me to do it, and to stop up the displeasure</p>

<p>he hath conceived against your son there is</p>

<p>no fitter matter. How does your Ladyship like it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  With very much content, my lord, and I</p>

<p>wish it happily effected.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of</p>

<p>as able body as when he numbered thirty. He will</p>

<p>be here tomorrow, or I am deceived by him that in</p>

<p>such intelligence hath seldom failed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  It rejoices me that, I hope, I shall see him</p>

<p>ere I die. I have letters that my son will be here</p>

<p>tonight. I shall beseech your Lordship to remain</p>

<p>with me till they meet together.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Madam, I was thinking with what manners I</p>

<p>might safely be admitted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  You need but plead your honorable</p>

<p>privilege.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Lady, of that I have made a bold charter. But I</p>

<p>thank my God it holds yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  O madam, yonder’s my lord your son with a</p>

<p>patch of velvet on ’s face. Whether there be a scar</p>

<p>under ’t or no, the velvet knows, but ’tis a goodly</p>

<p>patch of velvet. His left cheek is a cheek of two pile</p>

<p>and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv’ry</p>

<p>of honor. So belike is that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  But it is your carbonadoed face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Let us go see your son, I pray you. I long to talk</p>

<p>with the young noble soldier.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  ’Faith, there’s a dozen of ’em, with delicate fine</p>

<p>hats, and most courteous feathers which bow the</p>

<p>head and nod at every man.</p>
