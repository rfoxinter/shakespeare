<p><center><i>[Enter Lafew and Bertram.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  But I hope your Lordship thinks not him a</p>

<p>soldier.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  You have it from his own deliverance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  And by other warranted testimony.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Then my dial goes not true. I took this lark for</p>

<p>a bunting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in</p>

<p>knowledge and accordingly valiant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  I have then sinned against his experience and</p>

<p>transgressed against his valor, and my state that</p>

<p>way is dangerous since I cannot yet find in my</p>

<p>heart to repent. Here he comes. I pray you make us</p>

<p>friends. I will pursue the amity.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Parolles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span> <i>[to Bertram]</i>  These things shall be done, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span> <i>[to Bertram]</i>  Pray you, sir, who’s his tailor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  O, I know him well. Ay, sir, he, sir, ’s a good</p>

<p>workman, a very good tailor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span> <i>[aside to Parolles]</i>  Is she gone to the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  She is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  Will she away tonight?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  As you’ll have her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span></p>

<p>I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,</p>

<p>Given order for our horses, and tonight,</p>

<p>When I should take possession of the bride,</p>

<p>End ere I do begin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span> <i>[aside]</i>  A good traveler is something at the latter</p>

<p>end of a dinner, but one that lies three thirds,</p>

<p>and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings</p>

<p>with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.–</p>

<p>God save you, captain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span> <i>[to Parolles]</i>  Is there any unkindness</p>

<p>between my lord and you, monsieur?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  I know not how I have deserved to run into</p>

<p>my lord’s displeasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  You have made shift to run into ’t, boots and</p>

<p>spurs and all, like him that leapt into the custard;</p>

<p>and out of it you’ll run again rather than suffer</p>

<p>question for your residence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  And shall do so ever, though I took him at ’s</p>

<p>prayers. Fare you well, my lord, and believe this of</p>

<p>me: there can be no kernel in this light nut. The</p>

<p>soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in</p>

<p>matter of heavy consequence. I have kept of them</p>

<p>tame and know their natures.–Farewell, monsieur.</p>

<p>I have spoken better of you than you have or</p>

<p>will to deserve at my hand, but we must do good</p>

<p>against evil.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  An idle lord, I swear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  I think not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Why, do you not know him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span></p>

<p>Yes, I do know him well, and common speech</p>

<p>Gives him a worthy pass.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Helen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes my clog.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span></p>

<p>I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,</p>

<p>Spoke with the King and have procured his leave</p>

<p>For present parting. Only he desires</p>

<p>Some private speech with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  I shall obey his will.</p>

<p>You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,</p>

<p>Which holds not color with the time, nor does</p>

<p>The ministration and required office</p>

<p>On my particular. Prepared I was not</p>

<p>For such a business; therefore am I found</p>

<p>So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you</p>

<p>That presently you take your way for home,</p>

<p>And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;</p>

<p>For my respects are better than they seem,</p>

<p>And my appointments have in them a need</p>

<p>Greater than shows itself at the first view</p>

<p>To you that know them not.     <i><i>[Giving her a paper.]</i></i></p>

<p>This to my mother.</p>

<p>’Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so</p>

<p>I leave you to your wisdom.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  Sir, I can nothing say</p>

<p>But that I am your most obedient servant–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span></p>

<p>Come, come, no more of that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  And ever shall</p>

<p>With true observance seek to eke out that</p>

<p>Wherein toward me my homely stars have failed</p>

<p>To equal my great fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  Let that go.</p>

<p>My haste is very great. Farewell. Hie home.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span></p>

<p>Pray, sir, your pardon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  Well, what would you say?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span></p>

<p>I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,</p>

<p>Nor dare I say ’tis mine–and yet it is–</p>

<p>But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal</p>

<p>What law does vouch mine own.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  What would you have?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span></p>

<p>Something, and scarce so much; nothing, indeed.</p>

<p>I would not tell you what I would, my lord. Faith,</p>

<p>yes:</p>

<p>Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span></p>

<p>I pray you stay not, but in haste to horse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span></p>

<p>I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.–</p>

<p>Where are my other men?–Monsieur, farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span></p>

<p>Go thou toward home, where I will never come</p>

<p>Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.–</p>

<p>Away, and for our flight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Bravely, coraggio!</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
