<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King, Countess, Lafew, the two French</p>

<p>Lords, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem</p>

<p>Was made much poorer by it. But your son,</p>

<p>As mad in folly, lacked the sense to know</p>

<p>Her estimation home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  ’Tis past, my liege,</p>

<p>And I beseech your Majesty to make it</p>

<p>Natural rebellion done i’ th’ blade of youth,</p>

<p>When oil and fire, too strong for reason’s force,</p>

<p>O’erbears it and burns on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  My honored lady,</p>

<p>I have forgiven and forgotten all,</p>

<p>Though my revenges were high bent upon him</p>

<p>And watched the time to shoot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  This I must say–</p>

<p>But first I beg my pardon: the young lord</p>

<p>Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady</p>

<p>Offense of mighty note, but to himself</p>

<p>The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife</p>

<p>Whose beauty did astonish the survey</p>

<p>Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,</p>

<p>Whose dear perfection hearts that scorned to serve</p>

<p>Humbly called mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Praising what is lost</p>

<p>Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither.</p>

<p>We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill</p>

<p>All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon.</p>

<p>The nature of his great offense is dead,</p>

<p>And deeper than oblivion we do bury</p>

<p>Th’ incensing relics of it. Let him approach</p>

<p>A stranger, no offender, and inform him</p>

<p>So ’tis our will he should.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  I shall, my liege.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc></p>

<p>All that he is hath reference to your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me</p>

<p>That sets him high in fame.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Count Bertram.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  He looks well on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  I am not a day of season,</p>

<p>For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail</p>

<p>In me at once. But to the brightest beams</p>

<p>Distracted clouds give way. So stand thou forth.</p>

<p>The time is fair again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  My high-repented blames,</p>

<p>Dear sovereign, pardon to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  All is whole.</p>

<p>Not one word more of the consumed time.</p>

<p>Let’s take the instant by the forward top,</p>

<p>For we are old, and on our quick’st decrees</p>

<p>Th’ inaudible and noiseless foot of time</p>

<p>Steals ere we can effect them. You remember</p>

<p>The daughter of this lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  Admiringly, my liege. At first</p>

<p>I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart</p>

<p>Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue;</p>

<p>Where the impression of mine eye infixing,</p>

<p>Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,</p>

<p>Which warped the line of every other favor,</p>

<p>Scorned a fair color or expressed it stol’n,</p>

<p>Extended or contracted all proportions</p>

<p>To a most hideous object. Thence it came</p>

<p>That she whom all men praised and whom myself,</p>

<p>Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye</p>

<p>The dust that did offend it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Well excused.</p>

<p>That thou didst love her strikes some scores away</p>

<p>From the great compt. But love that comes too late,</p>

<p>Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,</p>

<p>To the great sender turns a sour offense,</p>

<p>Crying “That’s good that’s gone!” Our rash faults</p>

<p>Make trivial price of serious things we have,</p>

<p>Not knowing them until we know their grave.</p>

<p>Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,</p>

<p>Destroy our friends and after weep their dust.</p>

<p>Our own love, waking, cries to see what’s done,</p>

<p>While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.</p>

<p>Be this sweet Helen’s knell, and now forget her.</p>

<p>Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.</p>

<p>The main consents are had, and here we’ll stay</p>

<p>To see our widower’s second marriage day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless,</p>

<p>Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc></p>

<p>Come on, my son, in whom my house’s name</p>

<p>Must be digested, give a favor from you</p>

<p>To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,</p>

<p>That she may quickly come.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bertram gives him a ring.]</i></center></p>

<p>By my old beard</p>

<p>And ev’ry hair that’s on ’t, Helen that’s dead</p>

<p>Was a sweet creature. Such a ring as this,</p>

<p>The last that e’er I took her leave at court,</p>

<p>I saw upon her finger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  Hers it was not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Now, pray you, let me see it, for mine eye,</p>

<p>While I was speaking, oft was fastened to ’t.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lafew passes the ring to the King.]</i></center></p>

<p>This ring was mine, and when I gave it Helen,</p>

<p>I bade her if her fortunes ever stood</p>

<p>Necessitied to help, that by this token</p>

<p>I would relieve her. <i>[To Bertram.]</i> Had you that craft to</p>

<p>reave her</p>

<p>Of what should stead her most?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  My gracious</p>

<p>sovereign,</p>

<p>Howe’er it pleases you to take it so,</p>

<p>The ring was never hers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Son, on my life,</p>

<p>I have seen her wear it, and she reckoned it</p>

<p>At her life’s rate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  I am sure I saw her wear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>You are deceived, my lord. She never saw it.</p>

<p>In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,</p>

<p>Wrapped in a paper which contained the name</p>

<p>Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought</p>

<p>I stood ungaged, but when I had subscribed</p>

<p>To mine own fortune and informed her fully</p>

<p>I could not answer in that course of honor</p>

<p>As she had made the overture, she ceased</p>

<p>In heavy satisfaction and would never</p>

<p>Receive the ring again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Plutus himself,</p>

<p>That knows the tinct and multiplying med’cine,</p>

<p>Hath not in nature’s mystery more science</p>

<p>Than I have in this ring. ’Twas mine, ’twas Helen’s,</p>

<p>Whoever gave it you. Then if you know</p>

<p>That you are well acquainted with yourself,</p>

<p>Confess ’twas hers and by what rough enforcement</p>

<p>You got it from her. She called the saints to surety</p>

<p>That she would never put it from her finger</p>

<p>Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,</p>

<p>Where you have never come, or sent it us</p>

<p>Upon her great disaster.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  She never saw it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Thou speak’st it falsely, as I love mine honor,</p>

<p>And mak’st conjectural fears to come into me</p>

<p>Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove</p>

<p>That thou art so inhuman–’twill not prove so,</p>

<p>And yet I know not. Thou didst hate her deadly,</p>

<p>And she is dead, which nothing but to close</p>

<p>Her eyes myself could win me to believe</p>

<p>More than to see this ring.–Take him away.</p>

<p>My forepast proofs, howe’er the matter fall,</p>

<p>Shall tax my fears of little vanity,</p>

<p>Having vainly feared too little. Away with him.</p>

<p>We’ll sift this matter further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  If you shall prove</p>

<p>This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy</p>

<p>Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,</p>

<p>Where yet she never was.     <i><i>[He exits, under guard.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>I am wrapped in dismal thinkings.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  Gracious sovereign,</p>

<p>Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives the King a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>Here’s a petition from a Florentine</p>

<p>Who hath for four or five removes come short</p>

<p>To tender it herself. I undertook it,</p>

<p>Vanquished thereto by the fair grace and speech</p>

<p>Of the poor suppliant, who, by this, I know</p>

<p>Is here attending. Her business looks in her</p>

<p>With an importing visage, and she told me,</p>

<p>In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern</p>

<p>Your Highness with herself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[reads]</i>  Upon his many protestations to marry me</p>

<p>when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won</p>

<p>me. Now is the Count Rossillion a widower, his</p>

<p>vows are forfeited to me and my honor’s paid to him.</p>

<p>He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow</p>

<p>him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O king.</p>

<p>In you it best lies. Otherwise a seducer flourishes,</p>

<p>and a poor maid is undone.</p>

<p>Diana Capilet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for</p>

<p>this. I’ll none of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafew,</p>

<p>To bring forth this discov’ry.–Seek these suitors.</p>

<p>Go speedily, and bring again the Count.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gentleman and Attendants exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,</p>

<p>Was foully snatched.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Now justice on the doers!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bertram under guard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>I wonder, sir, since wives are monsters to you</p>

<p>And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,</p>

<p>Yet you desire to marry.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Widow and Diana.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What woman’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,</p>

<p>Derived from the ancient Capilet.</p>

<p>My suit, as I do understand, you know</p>

<p>And therefore know how far I may be pitied.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc></p>

<p>I am her mother, sir, whose age and honor</p>

<p>Both suffer under this complaint we bring,</p>

<p>And both shall cease without your remedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Come hither, count. Do you know these women?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I neither can nor will deny</p>

<p>But that I know them. Do they charge me further?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>Why do you look so strange upon your wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>She’s none of mine, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  If you shall marry,</p>

<p>You give away this hand, and that is mine;</p>

<p>You give away heaven’s vows, and those are mine;</p>

<p>You give away myself, which is known mine,</p>

<p>For I by vow am so embodied yours</p>

<p>That she which marries you must marry me,</p>

<p>Either both or none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc> <i>[to Bertram]</i>  Your reputation comes too short</p>

<p>for my daughter. You are no husband for her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc> <i>[to the King]</i></p>

<p>My lord, this is a fond and desp’rate creature</p>

<p>Whom sometime I have laughed with. Let your</p>

<p>Highness</p>

<p>Lay a more noble thought upon mine honor</p>

<p>Than for to think that I would sink it here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend</p>

<p>Till your deeds gain them. Fairer prove your honor</p>

<p>Than in my thought it lies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  Good my lord,</p>

<p>Ask him upon his oath if he does think</p>

<p>He had not my virginity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>What sayst thou to her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  She’s impudent, my lord,</p>

<p>And was a common gamester to the camp.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>He does me wrong, my lord. If I were so,</p>

<p>He might have bought me at a common price.</p>

<p>Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,</p>

<p>Whose high respect and rich validity</p>

<p>Did lack a parallel. Yet for all that</p>

<p>He gave it to a commoner o’ th’ camp,</p>

<p>If I be one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  He blushes, and ’tis hit.</p>

<p>Of six preceding ancestors that gem,</p>

<p>Conferred by testament to th’ sequent issue,</p>

<p>Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife.</p>

<p>That ring’s a thousand proofs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[to Diana]</i>  Methought you said</p>

<p>You saw one here in court could witness it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>I did, my lord, but loath am to produce</p>

<p>So bad an instrument. His name’s Parolles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc></p>

<p>I saw the man today, if man he be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Find him, and bring him hither.     <i><i>[Attendant exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  What of him?</p>

<p>He’s quoted for a most perfidious slave,</p>

<p>With all the spots o’ th’ world taxed and debauched,</p>

<p>Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.</p>

<p>Am I or that or this for what he’ll utter,</p>

<p>That will speak anything?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  She hath that ring of yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>I think she has. Certain it is I liked her</p>

<p>And boarded her i’ th’ wanton way of youth.</p>

<p>She knew her distance and did angle for me,</p>

<p>Madding my eagerness with her restraint,</p>

<p>As all impediments in fancy’s course</p>

<p>Are motives of more fancy; and in fine</p>

<p>Her infinite cunning with her modern grace</p>

<p>Subdued me to her rate. She got the ring,</p>

<p>And I had that which any inferior might</p>

<p>At market price have bought.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  I must be patient.</p>

<p>You that have turned off a first so noble wife</p>

<p>May justly diet me. I pray you yet–</p>

<p>Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband–</p>

<p>Send for your ring. I will return it home,</p>

<p>And give me mine again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  I have it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[to Diana]</i>  What ring was yours, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>Sir, much like the same upon your finger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>And this was it I gave him, being abed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>The story, then, goes false you threw it him</p>

<p>Out of a casement?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  I have spoke the truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Parolles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>You boggle shrewdly. Every feather starts you.–</p>

<p>Is this the man you speak of?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  Ay, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Tell me, sirrah–but tell me true, I charge you,</p>

<p>Not fearing the displeasure of your master,</p>

<p>Which, on your just proceeding, I’ll keep off–</p>

<p>By him and by this woman here what know you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  So please your Majesty, my master hath</p>

<p>been an honorable gentleman. Tricks he hath had</p>

<p>in him which gentlemen have.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Come, come, to th’ purpose. Did he love this</p>

<p>woman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Faith, sir, he did love her, but how?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  How, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a</p>

<p>woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  How is that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  He loved her, sir, and loved her not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  As thou art a knave and no knave. What an</p>

<p>equivocal companion is this!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I am a poor man, and at your Majesty’s</p>

<p>command.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  He’s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty</p>

<p>orator.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  Do you know he promised me marriage?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Faith, I know more than I’ll speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  But wilt thou not speak all thou know’st?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go</p>

<p>between them, as I said; but more than that he</p>

<p>loved her, for indeed he was mad for her, and</p>

<p>talked of Satan and of limbo and of furies and I</p>

<p>know not what. Yet I was in that credit with them</p>

<p>at that time, that I knew of their going to bed and</p>

<p>of other motions, as promising her marriage, and</p>

<p>things which would derive me ill will to speak of.</p>

<p>Therefore I will not speak what I know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst</p>

<p>say they are married. But thou art too fine in thy</p>

<p>evidence. Therefore stand aside.</p>

<p><center><i>[To Diana.]</i></center></p>

<p>This ring you say was yours?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  Ay, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Who lent it you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  It was not lent me neither.</p>

<p>Where did you find it then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  I found it not.</p>

<p>If it were yours by none of all these ways,</p>

<p>How could you give it him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  I never gave it him.</p>

<p>off and on at pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>This ring was mine. I gave it his first wife.</p>

<p>Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc></p>

<p>Because he’s guilty and he is not guilty.</p>

<p>He knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to ’t.</p>

<p>I’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.</p>

<p>Great king, I am no strumpet. By my life,</p>

<p>I am either maid or else this old man’s wife.</p>

<p>Though yet he never harmed me, here I quit him.</p>

<p>He knows himself my bed he hath defiled,</p>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>O, my good lord, when I was like this maid,</p>

<p>I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,</p>

<p>And, look you, here’s your letter. <i>[She takes out a</p>

<p>paper.]</i> This it says:</p>

<p>When from my finger you can get this ring</p>

<p>And are by me with child, etc. This is done.</p>

<p>Will you be mine now you are doubly won?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,</p>

<p>I’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>If it appear not plain and prove untrue,</p>

<p>Deadly divorce step between me and you.–</p>

<p>O my dear mother, do I see you living?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc></p>

<p>Mine eyes smell onions. I shall weep anon.–</p>

<p><i>[To Parolles.]</i> Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher.</p>

<p>So, I thank thee. Wait on me home.</p>

<p>I’ll make sport with thee. Let thy courtesies alone.</p>

<p>They are scurvy ones.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Let us from point to point this story know,</p>

<p>To make the even truth in pleasure flow.</p>

<p><i>[To Diana.]</i> If thou be’st yet a fresh uncropped flower,</p>

<p>Choose thou thy husband, and I’ll pay thy dower.</p>

<p>For I can guess that by thy honest aid</p>

<p>Thou kept’st a wife herself, thyself a maid.</p>

<p>Of that and all the progress more and less,</p>

<p>Resolvedly more leisure shall express.</p>

<p>All yet seems well, and if it end so meet,</p>

<p>The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.</p>
