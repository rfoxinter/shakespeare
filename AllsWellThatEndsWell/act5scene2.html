<p><center><i>[Enter Fool and Parolles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span> <i>[holding out a paper]</i>  Good Monsieur</p>

<p>Lavatch, give my lord Lafew this letter. I have ere</p>

<p>now, sir, been better known to you, when I have</p>

<p>held familiarity with fresher clothes. But I am</p>

<p>now, sir, muddied in Fortune’s mood, and smell</p>

<p>somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Truly, Fortune’s displeasure is but sluttish if it</p>

<p>smell so strongly as thou speak’st of. I will henceforth</p>

<p>eat no fish of Fortune’s butt’ring. Prithee,</p>

<p>allow the wind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir. I</p>

<p>spake but by a metaphor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink I will stop my</p>

<p>nose, or against any man’s metaphor. Prithee, get</p>

<p>thee further.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Foh! Prithee, stand away. A paper from Fortune’s</p>

<p>close-stool, to give to a nobleman!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lafew.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look, here he comes himself.–Here is a purr of</p>

<p>Fortune’s, sir, or of Fortune’s cat–but not a</p>

<p>musk-cat–that has fall’n into the unclean fishpond</p>

<p>of her displeasure and, as he says, is muddied</p>

<p>withal. Pray you, sir, use the carp as you may,</p>

<p>for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish,</p>

<p>rascally knave. I do pity his distress in my</p>

<p>smiles of comfort, and leave him to your Lordship.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath</p>

<p>cruelly scratched.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  And what would you have me to do? ’Tis too</p>

<p>late to pare her nails now. Wherein have you</p>

<p>played the knave with Fortune that she should</p>

<p>scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and</p>

<p>would not have knaves thrive long under her?</p>

<p>There’s a cardecu for you. Let the justices make</p>

<p>you and Fortune friends. I am for other business.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  I beseech your Honor to hear me one single</p>

<p>word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  You beg a single penny more. Come, you shall</p>

<p>ha ’t. Save your word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  My name, my good lord, is Parolles.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  You beg more than a word, then. Cock’s my</p>

<p>passion; give me your hand. How does your drum?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  O my good lord, you were the first that</p>

<p>found me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some</p>

<p>grace, for you did bring me out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Out upon thee, knave! Dost thou put upon me</p>

<p>at once both the office of God and the devil? One</p>

<p>brings thee in grace, and the other brings thee out.</p>

<p><i>[Trumpets sound.]</i> The King’s coming. I know by</p>

<p>his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me. I</p>

<p>had talk of you last night. Though you are a fool</p>

<p>and a knave, you shall eat. Go to, follow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  I praise God for you.</p>
