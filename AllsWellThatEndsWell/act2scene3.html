<p><center><i>[Enter Count Bertram, Lafew, and Parolles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  They say miracles are past, and we have our</p>

<p>philosophical persons to make modern and familiar</p>

<p>things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it</p>

<p>that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves</p>

<p>into seeming knowledge when we should</p>

<p>submit ourselves to an unknown fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Why, ’tis the rarest argument of wonder that</p>

<p>hath shot out in our latter times.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  And so ’tis.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  To be relinquished of the artists–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  So I say, both of Galen and Paracelsus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Of all the learned and authentic fellows–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Right, so I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  That gave him out incurable–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Why, there ’tis. So say I too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Not to be helped.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Right, as ’twere a man assured of a–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Uncertain life and sure death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Just. You say well. So would I have said.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  It is indeed. If you will have it in showing,</p>

<p>you shall read it in what-do-you-call there.</p>

<p><center><i>[He points to a paper in Lafew’s hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc> <i>[reads]</i>  A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly</p>

<p>actor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  That’s it. I would have said the very same.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Why, your dolphin is not lustier. ’Fore me, I</p>

<p>speak in respect–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Nay, ’tis strange, ’tis very strange; that is the</p>

<p>brief and the tedious of it; and he’s of a most facinorous</p>

<p>spirit that will not acknowledge it to be</p>

<p>the–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Very hand of heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Ay, so I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  In a most weak–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  And debile minister. Great power, great</p>

<p>transcendence, which should indeed give us a further</p>

<p>use to be made than alone the recov’ry of the</p>

<p>King, as to be–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Generally thankful.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King, Helen, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I would have said it. You say well. Here</p>

<p>comes the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I’ll like a maid</p>

<p>the better whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why,</p>

<p>he’s able to lead her a coranto.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  ’Fore God, I think so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Go, call before me all the lords in court.</p>

<p><center><i>[An Attendant exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Sit, my preserver, by thy patient’s side,</p>

<p>And with this healthful hand, whose banished sense</p>

<p>Thou hast repealed, a second time receive</p>

<p>The confirmation of my promised gift,</p>

<p>Which but attends thy naming.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter three or four Court Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel</p>

<p>Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,</p>

<p>O’er whom both sovereign power and father’s voice</p>

<p>I have to use. Thy frank election make.</p>

<p>Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress</p>

<p>Fall when Love please! Marry, to each but one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I’d give bay Curtal and his furniture</p>

<p>My mouth no more were broken than these boys’</p>

<p>And writ as little beard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Peruse them well.</p>

<p>Not one of those but had a noble father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Heaven hath through me restored the King to health.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc></p>

<p>We understand it and thank heaven for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest</p>

<p>That I protest I simply am a maid.–</p>

<p>Please it your Majesty, I have done already.</p>

<p>The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:</p>

<p>“We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be</p>

<p>refused,</p>

<p>Let the white death sit on thy cheek forever;</p>

<p>We’ll ne’er come there again.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Make choice and see.</p>

<p>Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,</p>

<p>And to imperial Love, that god most high,</p>

<p>Do my sighs stream.     <i><i>[She addresses her to a Lord.]</i></i></p>

<p>Sir, will you hear my suit?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Court</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>And grant it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Thanks, sir. All the</p>

<p>rest is mute.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  I had rather be in this choice than</p>

<p>throw ambs-ace for my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[to another Lord]</i></p>

<p>The honor, sir, that flames in your fair eyes</p>

<p>Before I speak too threat’ningly replies.</p>

<p>Love make your fortunes twenty times above</p>

<p>Her that so wishes, and her humble love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Court</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>No better, if you please.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  My wish receive,</p>

<p>Which great Love grant, and so I take my leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Do all they deny her? An they were sons</p>

<p>of mine, I’d have them whipped, or I would send</p>

<p>them to th’ Turk to make eunuchs of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[to another Lord]</i></p>

<p>Be not afraid that I your hand should take.</p>

<p>I’ll never do you wrong, for your own sake.</p>

<p>Blessing upon your vows, and in your bed</p>

<p>Find fairer fortune if you ever wed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  These boys are boys of ice; they’ll none</p>

<p>have her. Sure they are bastards to the English;</p>

<p>the French ne’er got ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[to another Lord]</i></p>

<p>You are too young, too happy, and too good</p>

<p>To make yourself a son out of my blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Court</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Fair one, I think not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  There’s one grape yet. I am sure thy</p>

<p>father drunk wine. But if thou be’st not an ass, I</p>

<p>am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[to Bertram]</i></p>

<p>I dare not say I take you, but I give</p>

<p>Me and my service ever whilst I live</p>

<p>Into your guiding power.–This is the man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Why then, young Bertram, take her. She’s thy wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>My wife, my liege? I shall beseech your Highness</p>

<p>In such a business give me leave to use</p>

<p>The help of mine own eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Know’st thou not,</p>

<p>Bertram,</p>

<p>What she has done for me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  Yes, my good lord,</p>

<p>But never hope to know why I should marry her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Thou know’st she has raised me from my sickly bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>But follows it, my lord, to bring me down</p>

<p>Must answer for your raising? I know her well;</p>

<p>She had her breeding at my father’s charge.</p>

<p>A poor physician’s daughter my wife? Disdain</p>

<p>Rather corrupt me ever!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>’Tis only title thou disdain’st in her, the which</p>

<p>I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,</p>

<p>Of color, weight, and heat, poured all together,</p>

<p>Would quite confound distinction, yet stands off</p>

<p>In differences so mighty. If she be</p>

<p>All that is virtuous, save what thou dislik’st–</p>

<p>“A poor physician’s daughter”–thou dislik’st</p>

<p>Of virtue for the name. But do not so.</p>

<p>From lowest place whence virtuous things proceed,</p>

<p>The place is dignified by th’ doer’s deed.</p>

<p>Where great additions swell ’s, and virtue none,</p>

<p>It is a dropsied honor. Good alone</p>

<p>Is good, without a name; vileness is so;</p>

<p>The property by what it is should go,</p>

<p>Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;</p>

<p>In these to nature she’s immediate heir,</p>

<p>And these breed honor. That is honor’s scorn</p>

<p>Which challenges itself as honor’s born</p>

<p>And is not like the sire. Honors thrive</p>

<p>When rather from our acts we them derive</p>

<p>Than our foregoers. The mere word’s a slave</p>

<p>Debauched on every tomb, on every grave</p>

<p>A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb</p>

<p>Where dust and damned oblivion is the tomb</p>

<p>Of honored bones indeed. What should be said?</p>

<p>If thou canst like this creature as a maid,</p>

<p>I can create the rest. Virtue and she</p>

<p>Is her own dower, honor and wealth from me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>I cannot love her, nor will strive to do ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Thou wrong’st thyself if thou shouldst strive to</p>

<p>choose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>That you are well restored, my lord, I’m glad.</p>

<p>Let the rest go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>My honor’s at the stake, which to defeat</p>

<p>I must produce my power.–Here, take her hand,</p>

<p>Proud, scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,</p>

<p>That dost in vile misprision shackle up</p>

<p>My love and her desert; that canst not dream</p>

<p>We, poising us in her defective scale,</p>

<p>Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know</p>

<p>It is in us to plant thine honor where</p>

<p>We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;</p>

<p>Obey our will, which travails in thy good.</p>

<p>Believe not thy disdain, but presently</p>

<p>Do thine own fortunes that obedient right</p>

<p>Which both thy duty owes and our power claims,</p>

<p>Or I will throw thee from my care forever</p>

<p>Into the staggers and the careless lapse</p>

<p>Of youth and ignorance, both my revenge and hate</p>

<p>Loosing upon thee in the name of justice</p>

<p>Without all terms of pity. Speak. Thine answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>Pardon, my gracious lord, for I submit</p>

<p>My fancy to your eyes. When I consider</p>

<p>What great creation and what dole of honor</p>

<p>Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late</p>

<p>Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now</p>

<p>The praised of the King, who, so ennobled,</p>

<p>Is as ’twere born so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Take her by the hand,</p>

<p>And tell her she is thine, to whom I promise</p>

<p>A counterpoise, if not to thy estate,</p>

<p>A balance more replete.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  I take her hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Good fortune and the favor of the King</p>

<p>Smile upon this contract, whose ceremony</p>

<p>Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief</p>

<p>And be performed tonight. The solemn feast</p>

<p>Shall more attend upon the coming space,</p>

<p>Expecting absent friends. As thou lov’st her</p>

<p>Thy love’s to me religious; else, does err.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit. Parolles and Lafew stay behind,</p>

<p>commenting of this wedding.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Your pleasure, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Your lord and master did well to make his</p>

<p>recantation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  “Recantation”? My “lord”? My “master”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Ay. Is it not a language I speak?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  A most harsh one, and not to be understood</p>

<p>without bloody succeeding. My “master”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Are you companion to the Count Rossillion?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  To any count, to all counts, to what is man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  To what is count’s man. Count’s master is of</p>

<p>another style.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are</p>

<p>too old.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man, to which</p>

<p>title age cannot bring thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  What I dare too well do, I dare not do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a</p>

<p>pretty wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent</p>

<p>of thy travel; it might pass. Yet the scarves and the</p>

<p>bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me</p>

<p>from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden.</p>

<p>I have now found thee. When I lose thee again, I</p>

<p>care not. Yet art thou good for nothing but taking</p>

<p>up, and that thou ’rt scarce worth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity</p>

<p>upon thee–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Do not plunge thyself too far in anger lest thou</p>

<p>hasten thy trial, which if–Lord have mercy on</p>

<p>thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare</p>

<p>thee well; thy casement I need not open, for I look</p>

<p>through thee. Give me thy hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  My lord, you give me most egregious</p>

<p>indignity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Ay, with all my heart, and thou art worthy of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I have not, my lord, deserved it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Yes, good faith, ev’ry dram of it, and I will not</p>

<p>bate thee a scruple.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Well, I shall be wiser.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Ev’n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to</p>

<p>pull at a smack o’ th’ contrary. If ever thou be’st</p>

<p>bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find</p>

<p>what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a</p>

<p>desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or</p>

<p>rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default</p>

<p>“He is a man I know.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  My lord, you do me most insupportable</p>

<p>vexation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my</p>

<p>poor doing eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by</p>

<p>thee in what motion age will give me leave.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace</p>

<p>off me. Scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must</p>

<p>be patient; there is no fettering of authority. I’ll</p>

<p>beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any</p>

<p>convenience, an he were double and double a lord.</p>

<p>I’ll have no more pity of his age than I would have</p>

<p>of–I’ll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lafew.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Sirrah, your lord and master’s married. There’s</p>

<p>news for you: you have a new mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I most unfeignedly beseech your Lordship</p>

<p>to make some reservation of your wrongs. He is</p>

<p>my good lord; whom I serve above is my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Who? God?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Ay, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  The devil it is that’s thy master. Why dost thou</p>

<p>garter up thy arms o’ this fashion? Dost make hose</p>

<p>of thy sleeves? Do other servants so? Thou wert</p>

<p>best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By</p>

<p>mine honor, if I were but two hours younger, I’d</p>

<p>beat thee. Methink’st thou art a general offense,</p>

<p>and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast</p>

<p>created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  This is hard and undeserved measure, my</p>

<p>lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Go to, sir. You were beaten in Italy for picking a</p>

<p>kernel out of a pomegranate. You are a vagabond,</p>

<p>and no true traveler. You are more saucy with</p>

<p>lords and honorable personages than the commission</p>

<p>of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry.</p>

<p>You are not worth another word; else I’d call you</p>

<p>knave. I leave you.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Good, very good! It is so, then. Good, very</p>

<p>good. Let it be concealed awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bertram Count Rossillion.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>Undone, and forfeited to cares forever!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  What’s the matter, sweetheart?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,</p>

<p>I will not bed her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  What, what, sweetheart?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>O my Parolles, they have married me!</p>

<p>I’ll to the Tuscan wars and never bed her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits</p>

<p>the tread of a man’s foot. To th’ wars!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  There’s letters from my mother. What th’</p>

<p>import is I know not yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Ay, that would be known. To th’ wars, my</p>

<p>boy, to th’ wars!</p>

<p>He wears his honor in a box unseen</p>

<p>That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,</p>

<p>Spending his manly marrow in her arms</p>

<p>Which should sustain the bound and high curvet</p>

<p>Of Mars’s fiery steed. To other regions!</p>

<p>France is a stable, we that dwell in ’t jades.</p>

<p>Therefore, to th’ war!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>It shall be so. I’ll send her to my house,</p>

<p>Acquaint my mother with my hate to her</p>

<p>And wherefore I am fled, write to the King</p>

<p>That which I durst not speak. His present gift</p>

<p>Shall furnish me to those Italian fields</p>

<p>Where noble fellows strike. Wars is no strife</p>

<p>To the dark house and the detested wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc></p>

<p>Will this capriccio hold in thee? Art sure?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.</p>

<p>I’ll send her straight away. Tomorrow</p>

<p>I’ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc></p>

<p>Why, these balls bound; there’s noise in it. ’Tis hard.</p>

<p>A young man married is a man that’s marred.</p>

<p>Therefore away, and leave her bravely. Go.</p>

<p>The King has done you wrong, but hush, ’tis so.</p>
