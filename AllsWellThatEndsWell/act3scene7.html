<p><center><i>[Enter Helen and Widow.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>If you misdoubt me that I am not she,</p>

<p>I know not how I shall assure you further</p>

<p>But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc></p>

<p>Though my estate be fall’n, I was well born,</p>

<p>Nothing acquainted with these businesses,</p>

<p>And would not put my reputation now</p>

<p>In any staining act.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Nor would I wish you.</p>

<p>First give me trust the Count he is my husband,</p>

<p>And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken</p>

<p>Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,</p>

<p>By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,</p>

<p>Err in bestowing it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc>  I should believe you,</p>

<p>For you have showed me that which well approves</p>

<p>You’re great in fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Take this purse of gold,</p>

<p>And let me buy your friendly help thus far,</p>

<p>Which I will overpay and pay again</p>

<p>When I have found it. The Count he woos your</p>

<p>daughter,</p>

<p>Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,</p>

<p>Resolved to carry her. Let her in fine consent</p>

<p>As we’ll direct her how ’tis best to bear it.</p>

<p>Now his important blood will naught deny</p>

<p>That she’ll demand. A ring the County wears</p>

<p>That downward hath succeeded in his house</p>

<p>From son to son some four or five descents</p>

<p>Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds</p>

<p>In most rich choice. Yet, in his idle fire,</p>

<p>To buy his will it would not seem too dear,</p>

<p>Howe’er repented after.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc></p>

<p>Now I see the bottom of your purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>You see it lawful, then. It is no more</p>

<p>But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,</p>

<p>Desires this ring, appoints him an encounter,</p>

<p>In fine, delivers me to fill the time,</p>

<p>Herself most chastely absent. After,</p>

<p>To marry her, I’ll add three thousand crowns</p>

<p>To what is passed already.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc>  I have yielded.</p>

<p>Instruct my daughter how she shall persever</p>

<p>That time and place with this deceit so lawful</p>

<p>May prove coherent. Every night he comes</p>

<p>With musics of all sorts and songs composed</p>

<p>To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us</p>

<p>To chide him from our eaves, for he persists</p>

<p>As if his life lay on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Why then tonight</p>

<p>Let us assay our plot, which, if it speed,</p>

<p>Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,</p>

<p>And lawful meaning in a lawful act,</p>

<p>Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.</p>

<p>But let’s about it.</p>
