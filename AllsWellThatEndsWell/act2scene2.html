<p><center><i>[Enter Countess and Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Come on, sir. I shall now put you to the</p>

<p>height of your breeding.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I</p>

<p>know my business is but to the court.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  “To the court”? Why, what place make you</p>

<p>special when you put off that with such contempt?</p>

<p>“But to the court”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners,</p>

<p>he may easily put it off at court. He that cannot</p>

<p>make a leg, put off ’s cap, kiss his hand, and</p>

<p>say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap;</p>

<p>and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were</p>

<p>not for the court. But, for me, I have an answer</p>

<p>will serve all men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Marry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all</p>

<p>questions.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  It is like a barber’s chair that fits all buttocks:</p>

<p>the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock,</p>

<p>or any buttock.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Will your answer serve fit to all questions?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,</p>

<p>as your French crown for your taffety punk, as</p>

<p>Tib’s rush for Tom’s forefinger, as a pancake for</p>

<p>Shrove Tuesday, a morris for May Day, as the nail</p>

<p>to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding</p>

<p>quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun’s lip to the</p>

<p>friar’s mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness</p>

<p>for all questions?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  From below your duke to beneath your constable,</p>

<p>it will fit any question.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  It must be an answer of most monstrous</p>

<p>size that must fit all demands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned</p>

<p>should speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that</p>

<p>belongs to ’t. Ask me if I am a courtier; it shall do</p>

<p>you no harm to learn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  To be young again, if we could! I will be a</p>

<p>fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your</p>

<p>answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  O Lord, sir!–There’s a simple putting off. More,</p>

<p>more, a hundred of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Sir, I am a poor friend of yours that loves</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  O Lord, sir!–Thick, thick. Spare not me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely</p>

<p>meat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  O Lord, sir!–Nay, put me to ’t, I warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  O Lord, sir!–Spare not me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Do you cry “O Lord, sir!” at your whipping,</p>

<p>and “spare not me”? Indeed your “O Lord, sir!” is</p>

<p>very sequent to your whipping. You would answer</p>

<p>very well to a whipping if you were but bound to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  I ne’er had worse luck in my life in my “O Lord,</p>

<p>sir!” I see things may serve long but not serve ever.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  I play the noble huswife with the time to</p>

<p>entertain it so merrily with a fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  O Lord, sir!–Why, there ’t serves well again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc> <i>[giving him a paper]</i></p>

<p>An end, sir. To your business. Give Helen this,</p>

<p>And urge her to a present answer back.</p>

<p>Commend me to my kinsmen and my son.</p>

<p>This is not much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Not much commendation to them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Not much employment for you. You understand me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Most fruitfully. I am there before my legs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Haste you again.</p>
