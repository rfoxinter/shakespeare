<p><center><i>[Enter Bertram and the maid called Diana.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span></p>

<p>They told me that your name was Fontibell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diana</span></p>

<p>No, my good lord, Diana.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  Titled goddess,</p>

<p>And worth it, with addition. But, fair soul,</p>

<p>In your fine frame hath love no quality?</p>

<p>If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,</p>

<p>You are no maiden but a monument.</p>

<p>When you are dead, you should be such a one</p>

<p>As you are now, for you are cold and stern,</p>

<p>And now you should be as your mother was</p>

<p>When your sweet self was got.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diana</span></p>

<p>She then was honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  So should you be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diana</span>  No.</p>

<p>My mother did but duty–such, my lord,</p>

<p>As you owe to your wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  No more o’ that.</p>

<p>I prithee do not strive against my vows.</p>

<p>I was compelled to her, but I love thee</p>

<p>By love’s own sweet constraint, and will forever</p>

<p>Do thee all rights of service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diana</span>  Ay, so you serve us</p>

<p>Till we serve you. But when you have our roses,</p>

<p>You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves</p>

<p>And mock us with our bareness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  How have I sworn!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diana</span></p>

<p>’Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,</p>

<p>But the plain single vow that is vowed true.</p>

<p>What is not holy, that we swear not by,</p>

<p>But take the high’st to witness. Then pray you, tell</p>

<p>me,</p>

<p>If I should swear by Jove’s great attributes</p>

<p>I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths</p>

<p>When I did love you ill? This has no holding</p>

<p>To swear by him whom I protest to love</p>

<p>That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths</p>

<p>Are words, and poor conditions but unsealed,</p>

<p>At least in my opinion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  Change it, change it.</p>

<p>Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy,</p>

<p>And my integrity ne’er knew the crafts</p>

<p>That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,</p>

<p>But give thyself unto my sick desires,</p>

<p>Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever</p>

<p>My love as it begins shall so persever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diana</span></p>

<p>I see that men may rope ’s in such a snare</p>

<p>That we’ll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span></p>

<p>I’ll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power</p>

<p>To give it from me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diana</span>  Will you not, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span></p>

<p>It is an honor ’longing to our house,</p>

<p>Bequeathed down from many ancestors,</p>

<p>Which were the greatest obloquy i’ th’ world</p>

<p>In me to lose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diana</span>  Mine honor’s such a ring.</p>

<p>My chastity’s the jewel of our house,</p>

<p>Bequeathed down from many ancestors,</p>

<p>Which were the greatest obloquy i’ th’ world</p>

<p>In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom</p>

<p>Brings in the champion Honor on my part</p>

<p>Against your vain assault.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  Here, take my ring.</p>

<p>My house, mine honor, yea, my life be thine,</p>

<p>And I’ll be bid by thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diana</span></p>

<p>When midnight comes, knock at my chamber</p>

<p>window.</p>

<p>I’ll order take my mother shall not hear.</p>

<p>Now will I charge you in the band of truth,</p>

<p>When you have conquered my yet maiden bed,</p>

<p>Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me.</p>

<p>My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them</p>

<p>When back again this ring shall be delivered.</p>

<p>And on your finger in the night I’ll put</p>

<p>Another ring, that what in time proceeds</p>

<p>May token to the future our past deeds.</p>

<p>Adieu till then; then, fail not. You have won</p>

<p>A wife of me, though there my hope be done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span></p>

<p>A heaven on Earth I have won by wooing thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diana</span></p>

<p>For which live long to thank both heaven and me!</p>

<p>You may so in the end.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>My mother told me just how he would woo</p>

<p>As if she sat in ’s heart. She says all men</p>

<p>Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me</p>

<p>When his wife’s dead. Therefore I’ll lie with him</p>

<p>When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,</p>

<p>Marry that will, I live and die a maid.</p>

<p>Only, in this disguise I think ’t no sin</p>

<p>To cozen him that would unjustly win.</p>
