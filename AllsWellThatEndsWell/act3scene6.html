<p><center><i>[Enter Bertram Count Rossillion and the French</p>

<p>Lords, as at first.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Nay, good my lord, put him to ’t. Let him</p>

<p>have his way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  If your Lordship find him not a hilding,</p>

<p>hold me no more in your respect.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  On my life, my lord, a bubble.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  Do you think I am so far deceived in him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Believe it, my lord. In mine own direct</p>

<p>knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of</p>

<p>him as my kinsman, he’s a most notable coward,</p>

<p>an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker,</p>

<p>the owner of no one good quality worthy</p>

<p>your Lordship’s entertainment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  It were fit you knew him, lest, reposing</p>

<p>too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might</p>

<p>at some great and trusty business in a main danger</p>

<p>fail you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  I would I knew in what particular action to</p>

<p>try him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  None better than to let him fetch off his</p>

<p>drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake</p>

<p>to do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly</p>

<p>surprise him. Such I will have whom I am sure</p>

<p>he knows not from the enemy. We will bind and</p>

<p>hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other</p>

<p>but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversary’s</p>

<p>when we bring him to our own tents. Be but</p>

<p>your Lordship present at his examination. If he do</p>

<p>not for the promise of his life, and in the highest</p>

<p>compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and</p>

<p>deliver all the intelligence in his power against</p>

<p>you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul</p>

<p>upon oath, never trust my judgment in anything.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch</p>

<p>his drum. He says he has a stratagem for ’t. When</p>

<p>your Lordship sees the bottom of his success in</p>

<p>’t, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore</p>

<p>will be melted, if you give him not John Drum’s</p>

<p>entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.</p>

<p>Here he comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Parolles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside to Bertram]</i>  O, for the love of laughter,</p>

<p>hinder not the honor of his design. Let him</p>

<p>fetch off his drum in any hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc> <i>[to Parolles]</i>  How now, monsieur? This</p>

<p>drum sticks sorely in your disposition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  A pox on ’t! Let it go. ’Tis but a drum.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  But a drum! Is ’t but a drum? A drum so</p>

<p>lost! There was excellent command, to charge in</p>

<p>with our horse upon our own wings and to rend</p>

<p>our own soldiers!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  That was not to be blamed in the command</p>

<p>of the service. It was a disaster of war that</p>

<p>Caesar himself could not have prevented if he had</p>

<p>been there to command.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.</p>

<p>Some dishonor we had in the loss of that</p>

<p>drum, but it is not to be recovered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  It might have been recovered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  It might, but it is not now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  It is to be recovered. But that the merit of</p>

<p>service is seldom attributed to the true and exact</p>

<p>performer, I would have that drum or another, or</p>

<p>hic jacet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  Why, if you have a stomach, to ’t, monsieur!</p>

<p>If you think your mystery in stratagem can bring</p>

<p>this instrument of honor again into his native</p>

<p>quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go</p>

<p>on. I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If</p>

<p>you speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it</p>

<p>and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,</p>

<p>even to the utmost syllable of your</p>

<p>worthiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  But you must not now slumber in it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I’ll about it this evening, and I will presently</p>

<p>pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my</p>

<p>certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;</p>

<p>and by midnight look to hear further from me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are</p>

<p>gone about it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I know not what the success will be, my</p>

<p>lord, but the attempt I vow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  I know thou ’rt valiant, and to the possibility</p>

<p>of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee. Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I love not many words.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  No more than a fish loves water. Is not this</p>

<p>a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems</p>

<p>to undertake this business which he knows is not</p>

<p>to be done, damns himself to do, and dares better</p>

<p>be damned than to do ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  You do not know him, my lord, as we do.</p>

<p>Certain it is that he will steal himself into a man’s</p>

<p>favor and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries,</p>

<p>but when you find him out, you have him</p>

<p>ever after.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  Why, do you think he will make no deed at</p>

<p>all of this that so seriously he does address himself</p>

<p>unto?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  None in the world, but return with an</p>

<p>invention and clap upon you two or three probable</p>

<p>lies. But we have almost embossed him. You shall</p>

<p>see his fall tonight; for indeed he is not for your</p>

<p>Lordship’s respect.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  We’ll make you some sport with the fox</p>

<p>ere we case him. He was first smoked by the old</p>

<p>Lord Lafew. When his disguise and he is parted,</p>

<p>tell me what a sprat you shall find him, which you</p>

<p>shall see this very night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  I must go look my twigs. He shall be</p>

<p>caught.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  Your brother he shall go along with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  As ’t please your Lordship. I’ll leave you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>Now will I lead you to the house and show you</p>

<p>The lass I spoke of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  But you say she’s honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>That’s all the fault. I spoke with her but once</p>

<p>And found her wondrous cold. But I sent to her,</p>

<p>By this same coxcomb that we have i’ th’ wind,</p>

<p>Tokens and letters, which she did re-send.</p>

<p>And this is all I have done. She’s a fair creature.</p>

<p>Will you go see her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  With all my heart, my lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
