<p><center><i>[Enter young Bertram Count of Rossillion, his mother</p>

<p>the Countess, and Helen, Lord Lafew, all in black.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  In delivering my son from me, I bury a second</p>

<p>husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  And I in going, madam, weep o’er my</p>

<p>father’s death anew; but I must attend his Majesty’s</p>

<p>command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore</p>

<p>in subjection.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  You shall find of the King a husband, madam;</p>

<p>you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times</p>

<p>good must of necessity hold his virtue to you,</p>

<p>whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted</p>

<p>rather than lack it where there is such abundance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  What hope is there of his Majesty’s</p>

<p>amendment?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  He hath abandoned his physicians, madam,</p>

<p>under whose practices he hath persecuted time</p>

<p>with hope, and finds no other advantage in the</p>

<p>process but only the losing of hope by time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  This young gentlewoman had a father–O,</p>

<p>that “had,” how sad a passage ’tis!–whose skill</p>

<p>was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched</p>

<p>so far, would have made nature immortal, and</p>

<p>death should have play for lack of work. Would for</p>

<p>the King’s sake he were living! I think it would be</p>

<p>the death of the King’s disease.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  How called you the man you speak of,</p>

<p>madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it</p>

<p>was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  He was excellent indeed, madam. The King</p>

<p>very lately spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly.</p>

<p>He was skillful enough to have lived still, if</p>

<p>knowledge could be set up against mortality.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  What is it, my good lord, the King languishes</p>

<p>of?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  A fistula, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  I heard not of it before.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  I would it were not notorious.–Was this gentlewoman</p>

<p>the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to</p>

<p>my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good</p>

<p>that her education promises. Her dispositions she</p>

<p>inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an</p>

<p>unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there</p>

<p>commendations go with pity–they are virtues and</p>

<p>traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness.</p>

<p>She derives her honesty and achieves her</p>

<p>goodness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Your commendations, madam, get from her</p>

<p>tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  ’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her</p>

<p>praise in. The remembrance of her father never</p>

<p>approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows</p>

<p>takes all livelihood from her cheek.–No</p>

<p>more of this, Helena. Go to. No more, lest it be</p>

<p>rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,</p>

<p>excessive grief the enemy to the living.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  If the living be enemy to the grief, the</p>

<p>excess makes it soon mortal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  How understand we that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span></p>

<p>Be thou blessed, Bertram, and succeed thy father</p>

<p>In manners as in shape. Thy blood and virtue</p>

<p>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness</p>

<p>Share with thy birthright. Love all, trust a few,</p>

<p>Do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy</p>

<p>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend</p>

<p>Under thy own life’s key Be checked for silence,</p>

<p>But never taxed for speech. What heaven more will,</p>

<p>That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,</p>

<p>Fall on thy head. <i>[To Lafew.]</i> Farewell, my lord.</p>

<p>’Tis an unseasoned courtier. Good my lord,</p>

<p>Advise him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  He cannot want the best that shall</p>

<p>Attend his love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  Heaven bless him.–Farewell, Bertram.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  The best wishes that can be forged in your</p>

<p>thoughts be servants to you.     <i><i>[Countess exits.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[To Helen.]</i> Be comfortable to my mother, your</p>

<p>mistress, and make much of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lafew</span>  Farewell, pretty lady. You must hold the credit</p>

<p>of your father.      <i><i>[Bertram and Lafew exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span></p>

<p>O, were that all! I think not on my father,</p>

<p>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</p>

<p>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</p>

<p>I have forgot him. My imagination</p>

<p>Carries no favor in ’t but Bertram’s.</p>

<p>I am undone. There is no living, none,</p>

<p>If Bertram be away. ’Twere all one</p>

<p>That I should love a bright particular star</p>

<p>And think to wed it, he is so above me.</p>

<p>In his bright radiance and collateral light</p>

<p>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</p>

<p>Th’ ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</p>

<p>The hind that would be mated by the lion</p>

<p>Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague,</p>

<p>To see him every hour, to sit and draw</p>

<p>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls</p>

<p>In our heart’s table–heart too capable</p>

<p>Of every line and trick of his sweet favor.</p>

<p>But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy</p>

<p>Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Parolles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>One that goes with him. I love him for his sake,</p>

<p>And yet I know him a notorious liar,</p>

<p>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward.</p>

<p>Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him</p>

<p>That they take place when virtue’s steely bones</p>

<p>Looks bleak i’ th’ cold wind. Withal, full oft we see</p>

<p>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Save you, fair queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  And you, monarch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  And no.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Are you meditating on virginity?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let</p>

<p>me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity.</p>

<p>How may we barricado it against him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Keep him out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  But he assails, and our virginity, though</p>

<p>valiant in the defense, yet is weak. Unfold to us</p>

<p>some warlike resistance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  There is none. Man setting down before you</p>

<p>will undermine you and blow you up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  Bless our poor virginity from underminers and</p>

<p>blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins</p>

<p>might blow up men?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Virginity being blown down, man will</p>

<p>quicklier be blown up. Marry, in blowing him</p>

<p>down again, with the breach yourselves made you</p>

<p>lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth</p>

<p>of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity</p>

<p>is rational increase, and there was never</p>

<p>virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you</p>

<p>were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by</p>

<p>being once lost may be ten times found; by being</p>

<p>ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion.</p>

<p>Away with ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  I will stand for ’t a little, though therefore I</p>

<p>die a virgin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  There’s little can be said in ’t. ’Tis against the</p>

<p>rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is</p>

<p>to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible</p>

<p>disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin;</p>

<p>virginity murders itself and should be buried in</p>

<p>highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate</p>

<p>offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,</p>

<p>much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very</p>

<p>paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.</p>

<p>Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of</p>

<p>self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</p>

<p>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by</p>

<p>’t. Out with ’t! Within ten year it will make itself</p>

<p>two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal</p>

<p>itself not much the worse. Away with ’t!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own</p>

<p>liking?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er</p>

<p>it likes. ’Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with</p>

<p>lying; the longer kept, the less worth. Off with ’t</p>

<p>while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity,</p>

<p>like an old courtier, wears her cap out of</p>

<p>fashion, richly suited but unsuitable, just like the</p>

<p>brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now.</p>

<p>Your date is better in your pie and your porridge</p>

<p>than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old</p>

<p>virginity, is like one of our French withered pears:</p>

<p>it looks ill, it eats dryly; marry, ’tis a withered pear.</p>

<p>It was formerly better, marry, yet ’tis a withered</p>

<p>pear. Will you anything with it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  Not my virginity, yet–</p>

<p>There shall your master have a thousand loves,</p>

<p>A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,</p>

<p>A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,</p>

<p>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</p>

<p>A counselor, a traitress, and a dear;</p>

<p>His humble ambition, proud humility,</p>

<p>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,</p>

<p>His faith, his sweet disaster, with a world</p>

<p>Of pretty, fond adoptious christendoms</p>

<p>That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he–</p>

<p>I know not what he shall. God send him well.</p>

<p>The court’s a learning place, and he is one–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  What one, i’ faith?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  That I wish well. ’Tis pity–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  What’s pity?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span></p>

<p>That wishing well had not a body in ’t</p>

<p>Which might be felt, that we, the poorer born,</p>

<p>Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,</p>

<p>Might with effects of them follow our friends</p>

<p>And show what we alone must think, which never</p>

<p>Returns us thanks.</p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Little Helen, farewell. If I can remember</p>

<p>thee, I will think of thee at court.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a</p>

<p>charitable star.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Under Mars, I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  I especially think under Mars.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Why under Mars?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  The wars hath so kept you under that you</p>

<p>must needs be born under Mars.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  When he was predominant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  When he was retrograde, I think rather.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  Why think you so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  You go so much backward when you fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  That’s for advantage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span>  So is running away, when fear proposes the</p>

<p>safety. But the composition that your valor and</p>

<p>fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I</p>

<p>like the wear well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Parolles</span>  I am so full of businesses I cannot answer</p>

<p>thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier, in the</p>

<p>which my instruction shall serve to naturalize</p>

<p>thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s counsel</p>

<p>and understand what advice shall thrust upon</p>

<p>thee, else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and</p>

<p>thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When</p>

<p>thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast</p>

<p>none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband,</p>

<p>and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[Parolles and Page exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span></p>

<p>Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie</p>

<p>Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky</p>

<p>Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull</p>

<p>Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.</p>

<p>What power is it which mounts my love so high,</p>

<p>That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?</p>

<p>The mightiest space in fortune nature brings</p>

<p>To join like likes and kiss like native things.</p>

<p>Impossible be strange attempts to those</p>

<p>That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose</p>

<p>What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove</p>

<p>To show her merit that did miss her love?</p>

<p>The King’s disease–my project may deceive me,</p>

<p>But my intents are fixed and will not leave me.</p>
