<p><center><i>[Enter Helen with a paper, and Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  My mother greets me kindly. Is she well?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  She is not well, but yet she has her health. She’s</p>

<p>very merry, but yet she is not well. But, thanks be</p>

<p>given, she’s very well and wants nothing i’ th’ world,</p>

<p>but yet she is not well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  If she be very well, what does she ail that she’s</p>

<p>not very well?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Truly, she’s very well indeed, but for two things.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  What two things?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  One, that she’s not in heaven, whither God send</p>

<p>her quickly; the other, that she’s in Earth, from</p>

<p>whence God send her quickly.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Parolles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Bless you, my fortunate lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine</p>

<p>own good fortunes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  You had my prayers to lead them on, and to</p>

<p>keep them on have them still.–O my knave, how</p>

<p>does my old lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I</p>

<p>would she did as you say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Why, I say nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Marry, you are the wiser man, for many a man’s</p>

<p>tongue shakes out his master’s undoing. To say</p>

<p>nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to</p>

<p>have nothing is to be a great part of your title,</p>

<p>which is within a very little of nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Away. Thou ’rt a knave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  You should have said, sir, “Before a knave,</p>

<p>thou ’rt a knave”; that’s “Before me, thou ’rt a</p>

<p>knave.” This had been truth, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Go to. Thou art a witty fool. I have found</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you</p>

<p>taught to find me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  ...</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  The search, sir, was profitable, and much fool</p>

<p>may you find in you, even to the world’s pleasure</p>

<p>and the increase of laughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  A good knave, i’ faith, and well fed.</p>

<p>Madam, my lord will go away tonight;</p>

<p>A very serious business calls on him.</p>

<p>The great prerogative and rite of love,</p>

<p>Which as your due time claims, he does acknowledge</p>

<p>But puts it off to a compelled restraint,</p>

<p>Whose want and whose delay is strewed with sweets,</p>

<p>Which they distill now in the curbed time</p>

<p>To make the coming hour o’erflow with joy</p>

<p>And pleasure drown the brim.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  What’s his will else?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc></p>

<p>That you will take your instant leave o’ th’ King</p>

<p>And make this haste as your own good proceeding,</p>

<p>Strengthened with what apology you think</p>

<p>May make it probable need.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  What more commands he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc></p>

<p>That, having this obtained, you presently</p>

<p>Attend his further pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>In everything I wait upon his will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I shall report it so.     <i><i>[Parolles exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[to Fool]</i>  I pray you, come, sirrah.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
