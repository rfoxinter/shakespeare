<p><center><i>[Enter Countess, Steward, and Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  I will now hear. What say you of this</p>

<p>gentlewoman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Steward</sc>  Madam, the care I have had to even your</p>

<p>content I wish might be found in the calendar of</p>

<p>my past endeavors, for then we wound our modesty</p>

<p>and make foul the clearness of our deservings</p>

<p>when of ourselves we publish them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  What does this knave here? <i>[To Fool.]</i> Get</p>

<p>you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have heard of</p>

<p>you I do not all believe. ’Tis my slowness that I do</p>

<p>not, for I know you lack not folly to commit them</p>

<p>and have ability enough to make such knaveries</p>

<p>yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  ’Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor</p>

<p>fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Well, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  No, madam, ’tis not so well that I am poor,</p>

<p>though many of the rich are damned. But if I may</p>

<p>have your Ladyship’s good will to go to the world,</p>

<p>Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Wilt thou needs be a beggar?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  I do beg your good will in this case.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  In what case?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  In Isbel’s case and mine own. Service is no heritage,</p>

<p>and I think I shall never have the blessing of</p>

<p>God till I have issue o’ my body, for they say bairns</p>

<p>are blessings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven</p>

<p>on by the flesh, and he must needs go that the devil</p>

<p>drives.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Is this all your Worship’s reason?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such</p>

<p>as they are.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  May the world know them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you</p>

<p>and all flesh and blood are, and indeed I do marry</p>

<p>that I may repent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Thy marriage sooner than thy wickedness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  I am out o’ friends, madam, and I hope to have</p>

<p>friends for my wife’s sake.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Such friends are thine enemies, knave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  You’re shallow, madam, in great friends, for the</p>

<p>knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary</p>

<p>of. He that ears my land spares my team and gives</p>

<p>me leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he’s my</p>

<p>drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher</p>

<p>of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh</p>

<p>and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves</p>

<p>my flesh and blood is my friend. Ergo, he that</p>

<p>kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented</p>

<p>to be what they are, there were no fear in</p>

<p>marriage, for young Charbon the Puritan and old</p>

<p>Poysam the Papist, howsome’er their hearts are</p>

<p>severed in religion, their heads are both one; they</p>

<p>may jowl horns together like any deer i’ th’ herd.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and</p>

<p>calumnious knave?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  A prophet I, madam, and I speak the truth the</p>

<p>next way:</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>For I the ballad will repeat</i></p>

<p>        <i>Which men full true shall find:</i></p>

<p>     <i>Your marriage comes by destiny;</i></p>

<p>        <i>Your cuckoo sings by kind.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Get you gone, sir. I’ll talk with you more</p>

<p>anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Steward</sc>  May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen</p>

<p>come to you. Of her I am to speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak</p>

<p>with her–Helen, I mean.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>“Was this fair face the cause,” quoth she,</i></p>

<p>        <i>“Why the Grecians sacked Troy?</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fond done, done fond.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Was this King Priam’s joy?”</i></p>

<p>     <i>With that she sighed as she stood,</i></p>

<p>     <i>With that she sighed as she stood,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And gave this sentence then:</i></p>

<p>     <i>“Among nine bad if one be good,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Among nine bad if one be good,</i></p>

<p>        <i>There’s yet one good in ten.”</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  What, one good in ten? You corrupt the</p>

<p>song, sirrah.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  One good woman in ten, madam, which is a</p>

<p>purifying o’ th’ song. Would God would serve the</p>

<p>world so all the year! We’d find no fault with the</p>

<p>tithe-woman if I were the parson. One in ten,</p>

<p>quoth he? An we might have a good woman born</p>

<p>but or every blazing star or at an earthquake,</p>

<p>’twould mend the lottery well. A man may draw his</p>

<p>heart out ere he pluck one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  You’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command</p>

<p>you!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  That man should be at woman’s command, and</p>

<p>yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no Puritan,</p>

<p>yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of</p>

<p>humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am</p>

<p>going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come</p>

<p>hither.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Well, now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Steward</sc>  I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman</p>

<p>entirely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Faith, I do. Her father bequeathed her to</p>

<p>me, and she herself, without other advantage, may</p>

<p>lawfully make title to as much love as she finds.</p>

<p>There is more owing her than is paid, and more</p>

<p>shall be paid her than she’ll demand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Steward</sc>  Madam, I was very late more near her than I</p>

<p>think she wished me. Alone she was and did communicate</p>

<p>to herself her own words to her own</p>

<p>ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touched</p>

<p>not any stranger sense. Her matter was she loved</p>

<p>your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that</p>

<p>had put such difference betwixt their two estates;</p>

<p>Love no god, that would not extend his might only</p>

<p>where qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins,</p>

<p>that would suffer her poor knight surprised</p>

<p>without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.</p>

<p>This she delivered in the most bitter touch</p>

<p>of sorrow that e’er I heard virgin exclaim in, which</p>

<p>I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal,</p>

<p>sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns</p>

<p>you something to know it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  You have discharged this honestly. Keep it</p>

<p>to yourself. Many likelihoods informed me of this</p>

<p>before, which hung so tott’ring in the balance that</p>

<p>I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you</p>

<p>leave me. Stall this in your bosom, and I thank you</p>

<p>for your honest care. I will speak with you further</p>

<p>anon.     <i><i>[Steward exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Helen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Aside.]</i></center></p>

<p>Even so it was with me when I was young.</p>

<p>   <i>If ever we are nature’s, these are ours. This thorn</i></p>

<p>Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong.</p>

<p>   <i>Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.</i></p>

<p>It is the show and seal of nature’s truth,</p>

<p>Where love’s strong passion is impressed in youth.</p>

<p>By our remembrances of days foregone,</p>

<p>Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.</p>

<p>Her eye is sick on ’t, I observe her now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  What is your pleasure, madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>You know, Helen, I am a mother to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>Mine honorable mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Nay, a mother.</p>

<p>Why not a mother? When I said “a mother,”</p>

<p>Methought you saw a serpent. What’s in “mother”</p>

<p>That you start at it? I say I am your mother</p>

<p>And put you in the catalogue of those</p>

<p>That were enwombed mine. ’Tis often seen</p>

<p>Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds</p>

<p>A native slip to us from foreign seeds.</p>

<p>You ne’er oppressed me with a mother’s groan,</p>

<p>Yet I express to you a mother’s care.</p>

<p>God’s mercy, maiden, does it curd thy blood</p>

<p>To say I am thy mother? What’s the matter,</p>

<p>That this distempered messenger of wet,</p>

<p>The many-colored Iris, rounds thine eye?</p>

<p>Why? That you are my daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  That I am not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>I say I am your mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Pardon, madam.</p>

<p>The Count Rossillion cannot be my brother.</p>

<p>I am from humble, he from honored name;</p>

<p>No note upon my parents, his all noble.</p>

<p>My master, my dear lord he is, and I</p>

<p>His servant live and will his vassal die.</p>

<p>He must not be my brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Nor I your mother?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>You are my mother, madam. Would you were–</p>

<p>So that my lord your son were not my brother–</p>

<p>Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,</p>

<p>I care no more for than I do for heaven,</p>

<p>So I were not his sister. Can ’t no other</p>

<p>But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>God shield you mean it not! “Daughter” and “mother”</p>

<p>So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?</p>

<p>My fear hath catched your fondness! Now I see</p>

<p>The mystery of your loneliness and find</p>

<p>Your salt tears’ head. Now to all sense ’tis gross:</p>

<p>You love my son. Invention is ashamed</p>

<p>Against the proclamation of thy passion</p>

<p>To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true,</p>

<p>But tell me then ’tis so, for, look, thy cheeks</p>

<p>Confess it th’ one to th’ other, and thine eyes</p>

<p>See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors</p>

<p>That in their kind they speak it. Only sin</p>

<p>And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue</p>

<p>That truth should be suspected. Speak. Is ’t so?</p>

<p>If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;</p>

<p>If it be not, forswear ’t; howe’er, I charge thee,</p>

<p>As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,</p>

<p>To tell me truly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Good madam, pardon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Do you love my son?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Your pardon, noble mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Love you my son?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Do not you love him, madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Go not about. My love hath in ’t a bond</p>

<p>Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose</p>

<p>The state of your affection, for your passions</p>

<p>Have to the full appeached.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i>  Then I confess</p>

<p>Here on my knee before high heaven and you</p>

<p>That before you and next unto high heaven</p>

<p>I love your son.</p>

<p>My friends were poor but honest; so ’s my love.</p>

<p>Be not offended, for it hurts not him</p>

<p>That he is loved of me. I follow him not</p>

<p>By any token of presumptuous suit,</p>

<p>Nor would I have him till I do deserve him,</p>

<p>Yet never know how that desert should be.</p>

<p>I know I love in vain, strive against hope,</p>

<p>Yet in this captious and intenible sieve</p>

<p>I still pour in the waters of my love</p>

<p>And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,</p>

<p>Religious in mine error, I adore</p>

<p>The sun that looks upon his worshipper</p>

<p>But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,</p>

<p>Let not your hate encounter with my love</p>

<p>For loving where you do; but if yourself,</p>

<p>Whose aged honor cites a virtuous youth,</p>

<p>Did ever in so true a flame of liking</p>

<p>Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian</p>

<p>Was both herself and Love, O then give pity</p>

<p>To her whose state is such that cannot choose</p>

<p>But lend and give where she is sure to lose;</p>

<p>That seeks not to find that her search implies,</p>

<p>But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Had you not lately an intent–speak truly–</p>

<p>To go to Paris?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Madam, I had.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Wherefore?</p>

<p>Tell true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[standing]</i></p>

<p>I will tell truth, by grace itself I swear.</p>

<p>You know my father left me some prescriptions</p>

<p>Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading</p>

<p>And manifest experience had collected</p>

<p>For general sovereignty; and that he willed me</p>

<p>In heedfull’st reservation to bestow them</p>

<p>As notes whose faculties inclusive were</p>

<p>More than they were in note. Amongst the rest</p>

<p>There is a remedy, approved, set down,</p>

<p>To cure the desperate languishings whereof</p>

<p>The King is rendered lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>This was your motive for Paris, was it? Speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>My lord your son made me to think of this;</p>

<p>Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King</p>

<p>Had from the conversation of my thoughts</p>

<p>Haply been absent then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  But think you, Helen,</p>

<p>If you should tender your supposed aid,</p>

<p>He would receive it? He and his physicians</p>

<p>Are of a mind: he that they cannot help him,</p>

<p>They that they cannot help. How shall they credit</p>

<p>A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools</p>

<p>Emboweled of their doctrine have left off</p>

<p>The danger to itself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  There’s something in ’t</p>

<p>More than my father’s skill, which was the great’st</p>

<p>Of his profession, that his good receipt</p>

<p>Shall for my legacy be sanctified</p>

<p>By th’ luckiest stars in heaven; and would your</p>

<p>Honor</p>

<p>But give me leave to try success, I’d venture</p>

<p>The well-lost life of mine on his Grace’s cure</p>

<p>By such a day, an hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Dost thou believe ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Ay, madam, knowingly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,</p>

<p>Means and attendants, and my loving greetings</p>

<p>To those of mine in court. I’ll stay at home</p>

<p>And pray God’s blessing into thy attempt.</p>

<p>Be gone tomorrow, and be sure of this:</p>

<p>What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.</p>
