<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>That you may well perceive I have not wronged you,</p>

<p>One of the greatest in the Christian world</p>

<p>Shall be my surety, ’fore whose throne ’tis needful,</p>

<p>Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.</p>

<p>Time was, I did him a desired office</p>

<p>Dear almost as his life, which gratitude</p>

<p>Through flinty Tartar’s bosom would peep forth</p>

<p>And answer thanks. I duly am informed</p>

<p>His Grace is at Marseilles, to which place</p>

<p>We have convenient convoy. You must know</p>

<p>I am supposed dead. The army breaking,</p>

<p>My husband hies him home, where, heaven aiding</p>

<p>And by the leave of my good lord the King,</p>

<p>We’ll be before our welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Widow</sc>  Gentle madam,</p>

<p>You never had a servant to whose trust</p>

<p>Your business was more welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Nor you, mistress,</p>

<p>Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labor</p>

<p>To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven</p>

<p>Hath brought me up to be your daughter’s dower,</p>

<p>As it hath fated her to be my motive</p>

<p>And helper to a husband. But O, strange men,</p>

<p>That can such sweet use make of what they hate</p>

<p>When saucy trusting of the cozened thoughts</p>

<p>Defiles the pitchy night! So lust doth play</p>

<p>With what it loathes for that which is away.</p>

<p>But more of this hereafter.–You, Diana,</p>

<p>Under my poor instructions yet must suffer</p>

<p>Something in my behalf.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diana</sc>  Let death and honesty</p>

<p>Go with your impositions, I am yours</p>

<p>Upon your will to suffer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Yet, I pray you–</p>

<p>But with the word “The time will bring on summer,”</p>

<p>When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns</p>

<p>And be as sweet as sharp. We must away.</p>

<p>Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us.</p>

<p>All’s well that ends well. Still the fine’s the crown.</p>

<p>Whate’er the course, the end is the renown.</p>
