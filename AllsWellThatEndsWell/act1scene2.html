<p><center><i>[Flourish cornets. Enter the King of France with letters,</p>

<p>two Lords, and divers Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>The Florentines and Senoys are by th’ ears,</p>

<p>Have fought with equal fortune, and continue</p>

<p>A braving war.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  So ’tis reported, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Nay, ’tis most credible. We here receive it</p>

<p>A certainty vouched from our cousin Austria,</p>

<p>With caution that the Florentine will move us</p>

<p>For speedy aid, wherein our dearest friend</p>

<p>Prejudicates the business and would seem</p>

<p>To have us make denial.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  His love and wisdom,</p>

<p>Approved so to your Majesty, may plead</p>

<p>For amplest credence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  He hath armed our answer,</p>

<p>And Florence is denied before he comes.</p>

<p>Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see</p>

<p>The Tuscan service, freely have they leave</p>

<p>To stand on either part.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  It well may serve</p>

<p>A nursery to our gentry, who are sick</p>

<p>For breathing and exploit.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bertram, Lafew, and Parolles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  What’s he comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>It is the Count Rossillion, my good lord,</p>

<p>Young Bertram.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Youth, thou bear’st thy father’s face.</p>

<p>Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,</p>

<p>Hath well composed thee. Thy father’s moral parts</p>

<p>Mayst thou inherit too. Welcome to Paris.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span></p>

<p>My thanks and duty are your Majesty’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>I would I had that corporal soundness now</p>

<p>As when thy father and myself in friendship</p>

<p>First tried our soldiership. He did look far</p>

<p>Into the service of the time and was</p>

<p>Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long,</p>

<p>But on us both did haggish age steal on</p>

<p>And wore us out of act. It much repairs me</p>

<p>To talk of your good father. In his youth</p>

<p>He had the wit which I can well observe</p>

<p>Today in our young lords; but they may jest</p>

<p>Till their own scorn return to them unnoted</p>

<p>Ere they can hide their levity in honor.</p>

<p>So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness</p>

<p>Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,</p>

<p>His equal had awaked them, and his honor,</p>

<p>Clock to itself, knew the true minute when</p>

<p>Exception bid him speak, and at this time</p>

<p>His tongue obeyed his hand. Who were below him</p>

<p>He used as creatures of another place</p>

<p>And bowed his eminent top to their low ranks,</p>

<p>Making them proud of his humility,</p>

<p>In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man</p>

<p>Might be a copy to these younger times,</p>

<p>Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now</p>

<p>But goers backward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  His good remembrance, sir,</p>

<p>Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb.</p>

<p>So in approof lives not his epitaph</p>

<p>As in your royal speech.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Would I were with him! He would always say–</p>

<p>Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words</p>

<p>He scattered not in ears, but grafted them</p>

<p>To grow there and to bear. “Let me not live”–</p>

<p>This his good melancholy oft began</p>

<p>On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,</p>

<p>When it was out–“Let me not live,” quoth he,</p>

<p>“After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff</p>

<p>Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses</p>

<p>All but new things disdain, whose judgments are</p>

<p>Mere fathers of their garments, whose constancies</p>

<p>Expire before their fashions.” This he wished.</p>

<p>I, after him, do after him wish too,</p>

<p>Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,</p>

<p>I quickly were dissolved from my hive</p>

<p>To give some laborers room.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  You’re loved, sir.</p>

<p>They that least lend it you shall lack you first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>I fill a place, I know ’t.–How long is ’t, count,</p>

<p>Since the physician at your father’s died?</p>

<p>He was much famed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  Some six months since, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>If he were living, I would try him yet.–</p>

<p>Lend me an arm.–The rest have worn me out</p>

<p>With several applications. Nature and sickness</p>

<p>Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count.</p>

<p>My son’s no dearer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bertram</span>  Thank your Majesty.</p>
