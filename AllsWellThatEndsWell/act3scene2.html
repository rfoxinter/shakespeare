<p><center><i>[Enter Countess, with a paper, and Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  It hath happened all as I would have had it,</p>

<p>save that he comes not along with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very</p>

<p>melancholy man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  By what observance, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Why, he will look upon his boot and sing, mend</p>

<p>the ruff and sing, ask questions and sing, pick his</p>

<p>teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of</p>

<p>melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Let me see what he writes and when he</p>

<p>means to come.     <i><i>[She opens the letter.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our</p>

<p>old lings and our Isbels o’ th’ country are nothing</p>

<p>like your old ling and your Isbels o’ th’ court. The</p>

<p>brains of my Cupid’s knocked out, and I begin to</p>

<p>love as an old man loves money, with no stomach.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  What have we here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  E’en that you have there.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc> <i>[reads.]</i>  I have sent you a daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>She hath recovered the King and undone me. I have</p>

<p>wedded her, not bedded her, and sworn to make the</p>

<p>“not” eternal. You shall hear I am run away. Know it</p>

<p>before the report come. If there be breadth enough in</p>

<p>the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to</p>

<p>you.</p>

<p>     <i>Your unfortunate son,</i></p>

<p>Bertram.</p>

<p>This is not well, rash and unbridled boy:</p>

<p>To fly the favors of so good a king,</p>

<p>To pluck his indignation on thy head</p>

<p>By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous</p>

<p>For the contempt of empire.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  O madam, yonder is heavy news within, between</p>

<p>two soldiers and my young lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  What is the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some</p>

<p>comfort. Your son will not be killed so soon as I</p>

<p>thought he would.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Why should he be killed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he</p>

<p>does. The danger is in standing to ’t; that’s the loss</p>

<p>of men, though it be the getting of children. Here</p>

<p>they come will tell you more. For my part, I only</p>

<p>hear your son was run away.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Helen, with a paper, and two Gentlemen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc> <i>[to Countess]</i>  Save you, good</p>

<p>madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>Madam, my lord is gone, forever gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Do not say so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Think upon patience, pray you.–Gentlemen,</p>

<p>I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief</p>

<p>That the first face of neither on the start</p>

<p>Can woman me unto ’t. Where is my son, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Madam, he’s gone to serve the Duke of Florence.</p>

<p>We met him thitherward, for thence we came,</p>

<p>And, after some dispatch in hand at court,</p>

<p>Thither we bend again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>Look on his letter, madam; here’s my passport.</p>

<p><i>[She reads.]</i> When thou canst get the ring upon</p>

<p>my finger, which never shall come off, and show me</p>

<p>a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then</p>

<p>call me husband. But in such a “then” I write a</p>

<p>“never.”</p>

<p>This is a dreadful sentence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Brought you this letter, gentlemen?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Ay, madam,</p>

<p>And for the contents’ sake are sorry for our pains.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>I prithee, lady, have a better cheer.</p>

<p>If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,</p>

<p>Thou robb’st me of a moiety. He was my son,</p>

<p>But I do wash his name out of my blood,</p>

<p>And thou art all my child.–Towards Florence is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Ay, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  And to be a soldier?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Such is his noble purpose, and, believe ’t,</p>

<p>The Duke will lay upon him all the honor</p>

<p>That good convenience claims.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Return you thither?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc> <i>[reads]</i></p>

<p>Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.</p>

<p>’Tis bitter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Find you that there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Ay, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>’Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply,</p>

<p>Which his heart was not consenting to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Nothing in France until he have no wife!</p>

<p>There’s nothing here that is too good for him</p>

<p>But only she, and she deserves a lord</p>

<p>That twenty such rude boys might tend upon</p>

<p>And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>A servant only, and a gentleman</p>

<p>Which I have sometime known.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  Parolles was it not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Ay, my good lady, he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.</p>

<p>My son corrupts a well-derived nature</p>

<p>With his inducement.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Indeed, good lady,</p>

<p>The fellow has a deal of that too much</p>

<p>Which holds him much to have.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc>  You’re welcome,</p>

<p>gentlemen.</p>

<p>I will entreat you when you see my son</p>

<p>To tell him that his sword can never win</p>

<p>The honor that he loses. More I’ll entreat you</p>

<p>Written to bear along.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  We serve you, madam,</p>

<p>In that and all your worthiest affairs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countess</sc></p>

<p>Not so, but as we change our courtesies.</p>

<p>Will you draw near?</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits with the Gentlemen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>“Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.”</p>

<p>Nothing in France until he has no wife.</p>

<p>Thou shalt have none, Rossillion, none in France.</p>

<p>Then hast thou all again. Poor lord, is ’t I</p>

<p>That chase thee from thy country and expose</p>

<p>Those tender limbs of thine to the event</p>

<p>Of the none-sparing war? And is it I</p>

<p>That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou</p>

<p>Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark</p>

<p>Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers</p>

<p>That ride upon the violent speed of fire,</p>

<p>Fly with false aim; move the still-’pearing air</p>

<p>That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.</p>

<p>Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;</p>

<p>Whoever charges on his forward breast,</p>

<p>I am the caitiff that do hold him to ’t;</p>

<p>And though I kill him not, I am the cause</p>

<p>His death was so effected. Better ’twere</p>

<p>I met the ravin lion when he roared</p>

<p>With sharp constraint of hunger; better ’twere</p>

<p>That all the miseries which nature owes</p>

<p>Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rossillion,</p>

<p>Whence honor but of danger wins a scar,</p>

<p>As oft it loses all. I will be gone.</p>

<p>My being here it is that holds thee hence.</p>

<p>Shall I stay here to do ’t? No, no, although</p>

<p>The air of paradise did fan the house</p>

<p>And angels officed all. I will be gone,</p>

<p>That pitiful rumor may report my flight</p>

<p>To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;</p>

<p>For with the dark, poor thief, I’ll steal away.</p>
