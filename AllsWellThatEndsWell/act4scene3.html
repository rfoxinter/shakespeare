<p><center><i>[Enter the two French Lords and some two</p>

<p>or three Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  You have not given him his mother’s</p>

<p>letter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  I have delivered it an hour since. There</p>

<p>is something in ’t that stings his nature, for on the</p>

<p>reading it he changed almost into another man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  He has much worthy blame laid upon him</p>

<p>for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Especially he hath incurred the everlasting</p>

<p>displeasure of the King, who had even tuned</p>

<p>his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you</p>

<p>a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  When you have spoken it, ’tis dead, and I</p>

<p>am the grave of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  He hath perverted a young gentlewoman</p>

<p>here in Florence of a most chaste renown,</p>

<p>and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her</p>

<p>honor. He hath given her his monumental ring and</p>

<p>thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Now God delay our rebellion! As we are</p>

<p>ourselves, what things are we!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Merely our own traitors. And, as in the</p>

<p>common course of all treasons we still see them</p>

<p>reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorred</p>

<p>ends, so he that in this action contrives against his</p>

<p>own nobility, in his proper stream o’erflows</p>

<p>himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters</p>

<p>of our unlawful intents? We shall not, then,</p>

<p>have his company tonight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Not till after midnight, for he is dieted to</p>

<p>his hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  That approaches apace. I would gladly</p>

<p>have him see his company anatomized, that he</p>

<p>might take a measure of his own judgments</p>

<p>wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  We will not meddle with him till he</p>

<p>come, for his presence must be the whip of the</p>

<p>other.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  In the meantime, what hear you of these</p>

<p>wars?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  I hear there is an overture of peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  What will Count Rossillion do then?</p>

<p>Will he travel higher or return again into France?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  I perceive by this demand you are not altogether</p>

<p>of his counsel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a</p>

<p>great deal of his act.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Sir, his wife some two months since fled</p>

<p>from his house. Her pretense is a pilgrimage to</p>

<p>Saint Jaques le Grand, which holy undertaking</p>

<p>with most austere sanctimony she accomplished.</p>

<p>And, there residing, the tenderness of her nature</p>

<p>became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan</p>

<p>of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  How is this justified?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  The stronger part of it by her own letters,</p>

<p>which makes her story true even to the point of her</p>

<p>death. Her death itself, which could not be her</p>

<p>office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by</p>

<p>the rector of the place.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Hath the Count all this intelligence?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Ay, and the particular confirmations, point</p>

<p>from point, to the full arming of the verity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  I am heartily sorry that he’ll be glad of</p>

<p>this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  How mightily sometimes we make us</p>

<p>comforts of our losses.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  And how mightily some other times we</p>

<p>drown our gain in tears. The great dignity that his</p>

<p>valor hath here acquired for him shall at home be</p>

<p>encountered with a shame as ample.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  The web of our life is of a mingled yarn,</p>

<p>good and ill together. Our virtues would be proud</p>

<p>if our faults whipped them not, and our crimes</p>

<p>would despair if they were not cherished by our</p>

<p>virtues.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now? Where’s your master?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  He met the Duke in the street, sir, of whom</p>

<p>he hath taken a solemn leave. His Lordship will</p>

<p>next morning for France. The Duke hath offered</p>

<p>him letters of commendations to the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  They shall be no more than needful</p>

<p>there, if they were more than they can commend.</p>

<p>They cannot be too sweet for the King’s tartness.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bertram Count Rossillion.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here’s his Lordship now.–How now, my lord? Is ’t</p>

<p>not after midnight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  I have tonight dispatched sixteen businesses,</p>

<p>a month’s length apiece. By an abstract of</p>

<p>success: I have congeed with the Duke, done my</p>

<p>adieu with his nearest, buried a wife, mourned for</p>

<p>her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained</p>

<p>my convoy, and between these main parcels</p>

<p>of dispatch effected many nicer needs. The last</p>

<p>was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  If the business be of any difficulty, and</p>

<p>this morning your departure hence, it requires</p>

<p>haste of your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  I mean the business is not ended as fearing</p>

<p>to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue</p>

<p>between the Fool and the Soldier? Come,</p>

<p>bring forth this counterfeit module; has deceived</p>

<p>me like a double-meaning prophesier.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Bring him forth. Has sat i’ th’ stocks all</p>

<p>night, poor gallant knave.     <i><i>[Soldiers exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  No matter. His heels have deserved it in</p>

<p>usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry</p>

<p>himself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  I have told your Lordship already: the</p>

<p>stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would</p>

<p>be understood: he weeps like a wench that had</p>

<p>shed her milk. He hath confessed himself to Morgan,</p>

<p>whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time</p>

<p>of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of</p>

<p>his setting i’ th’ stocks. And what think you he hath</p>

<p>confessed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  Nothing of me, has he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  His confession is taken, and it shall be</p>

<p>read to his face. If your Lordship be in ’t, as I</p>

<p>believe you are, you must have the patience to</p>

<p>hear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Parolles, blindfolded, with his Interpreter,</p>

<p>the First Soldier.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  A plague upon him! Muffled! He can say</p>

<p>nothing of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside to Bertram]</i>  Hush, hush. Hoodman</p>

<p>comes.–Portotartarossa.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc> <i>[to Parolles]</i>  He calls for the tortures.</p>

<p>What will you say without ’em?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I will confess what I know without constraint.</p>

<p>If you pinch me like a pasty, I can say no</p>

<p>more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  Bosko Chimurcho.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Boblibindo chicurmurco.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  You are a merciful general.–Our general</p>

<p>bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a</p>

<p>note.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  And truly, as I hope to live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc> <i>[as if reading a note]</i>  First, demand of</p>

<p>him how many horse the Duke is strong.–What say</p>

<p>you to that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Five or six thousand, but very weak and</p>

<p>unserviceable. The troops are all scattered, and the</p>

<p>commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation</p>

<p>and credit, and as I hope to live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  Shall I set down your answer so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Do. I’ll take the Sacrament on ’t, how and</p>

<p>which way you will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  All’s one to him. What a past-saving</p>

<p>slave is this!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside to Bertram]</i>  You’re deceived, my</p>

<p>lord. This is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant</p>

<p>militarist–that was his own phrase–that had the</p>

<p>whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and</p>

<p>the practice in the chape of his dagger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  I will never trust a man again for</p>

<p>keeping his sword clean, nor believe he can have</p>

<p>everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc> <i>[to Parolles]</i>  Well, that’s set down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  “Five or six thousand horse,” I said–I will</p>

<p>say true–“or thereabouts” set down, for I’ll speak</p>

<p>truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He’s very near the truth in this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  But I con him no thanks for ’t, in the</p>

<p>nature he delivers it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  “Poor rogues,” I pray you say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  Well, that’s set down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I humbly thank you, sir. A truth’s a truth.</p>

<p>The rogues are marvelous poor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc> <i>[as if reading a note]</i>  Demand of him of</p>

<p>what strength they are o’ foot.–What say you to</p>

<p>that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  By my troth, sir, if I were to live but this</p>

<p>present hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio a</p>

<p>hundred and fifty, Sebastian so many, Corambus</p>

<p>so many, Jaques so many; Guiltian, Cosmo,</p>

<p>Lodowick and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine</p>

<p>own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two</p>

<p>hundred fifty each; so that the muster-file, rotten</p>

<p>and sound, upon my life amounts not to fifteen</p>

<p>thousand poll, half of the which dare not shake the</p>

<p>snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves</p>

<p>to pieces.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  What shall be done to him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Nothing but let him have thanks.</p>

<p><i>[(Aside to First Soldier.)]</i> Demand of him my condition</p>

<p>and what credit I have with the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc> <i>[to Parolles]</i>  Well, that’s set down. <i>[Pretending</p>

<p>to read:]</i> You shall demand of him whether</p>

<p>one Captain Dumaine be i’ th’ camp, a Frenchman;</p>

<p>what his reputation is with the Duke, what his valor,</p>

<p>honesty, and expertness in wars; or whether he</p>

<p>thinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums</p>

<p>of gold to corrupt him to a revolt.–What say you to</p>

<p>this? What do you know of it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I beseech you let me answer to the particular</p>

<p>of the inter’gatories. Demand them singly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  Do you know this Captain Dumaine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I know him. He was a botcher’s prentice in</p>

<p>Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the</p>

<p>shrieve’s fool with child, a dumb innocent that</p>

<p>could not say him nay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc> <i>[aside to First Lord]</i>  Nay, by your leave, hold</p>

<p>your hands, though I know his brains are forfeit to</p>

<p>the next tile that falls.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  Well, is this captain in the Duke of</p>

<p>Florence’s camp?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Upon my knowledge he is, and lousy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside to Bertram]</i>  Nay, look not so upon</p>

<p>me. We shall hear of your Lordship anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  What is his reputation with the Duke?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  The Duke knows him for no other but a</p>

<p>poor officer of mine, and writ to me this other day</p>

<p>to turn him out o’ th’ band. I think I have his letter</p>

<p>in my pocket.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  Marry, we’ll search.</p>

<p><center><i>[They search Parolles’ pockets.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  In good sadness, I do not know. Either it is</p>

<p>there, or it is upon a file with the Duke’s other letters</p>

<p>in my tent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  Here ’tis; here’s a paper. Shall I read it to</p>

<p>you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  I do not know if it be it or no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Our interpreter does it well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Excellently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc> <i>[reads]</i>  Dian, the Count’s a fool and full</p>

<p>of gold–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  That is not the Duke’s letter, sir. That is an</p>

<p>advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one</p>

<p>Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count</p>

<p>Rossillion, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very</p>

<p>ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  Nay, I’ll read it first, by your favor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  My meaning in ’t, I protest, was very honest</p>

<p>in the behalf of the maid, for I knew the young</p>

<p>count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is</p>

<p>a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it</p>

<p>finds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Damnable both-sides rogue!</p>

<p>     <i>When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and</i></p>

<p>take it.</p>

<p>        <i>After he scores, he never pays the score.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Half won is match well made. Match, and well</i></p>

<p>make it.</p>

<p>        <i>He ne’er pays after-debts. Take it before.</i></p>

<p>     <i>And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:</i></p>

<p>     <i>Men are to mell with; boys are not to kiss.</i></p>

<p>     <i>For count of this: the Count’s a fool, I know it,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,</i></p>

<p>Parolles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He shall be whipped through the</p>

<p>army with this rhyme in ’s forehead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  This is your devoted friend, sir,</p>

<p>the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  I could endure anything before but a</p>

<p>cat, and now he’s a cat to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc> <i>[to Parolles]</i>  I perceive, sir, by our</p>

<p>general’s looks we shall be fain to hang you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid</p>

<p>to die, but that, my offenses being many, I would</p>

<p>repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live,</p>

<p>sir, in a dungeon, i’ th’ stocks, or anywhere, so I</p>

<p>may live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  We’ll see what may be done, so you confess</p>

<p>freely. Therefore once more to this Captain</p>

<p>Dumaine: you have answered to his reputation</p>

<p>with the Duke, and to his valor. What is his</p>

<p>honesty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister. For</p>

<p>rapes and ravishments, he parallels Nessus. He</p>

<p>professes not keeping of oaths. In breaking ’em he</p>

<p>is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such</p>

<p>volubility that you would think truth were a fool.</p>

<p>Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be</p>

<p>swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm,</p>

<p>save to his bedclothes about him; but they know</p>

<p>his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but</p>

<p>little more to say, sir, of his honesty; he has everything</p>

<p>that an honest man should not have; what an</p>

<p>honest man should have, he has nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  I begin to love him for this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  For this description of thine honesty?</p>

<p>A pox upon him! For me, he’s more and more</p>

<p>a cat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  What say you to his expertness in war?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English</p>

<p>tragedians. To belie him I will not, and more</p>

<p>of his soldiership I know not, except in that country</p>

<p>he had the honor to be the officer at a place</p>

<p>there called Mile End, to instruct for the doubling</p>

<p>of files. I would do the man what honor I can, but</p>

<p>of this I am not certain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He hath out-villained villainy so</p>

<p>far that the rarity redeems him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  A pox on him! He’s a cat still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  His qualities being at this poor price,</p>

<p>I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to</p>

<p>revolt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Sir, for a cardecu he will sell the fee-simple</p>

<p>of his salvation, the inheritance of it, and cut th’</p>

<p>entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession</p>

<p>for it perpetually.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  What’s his brother, the other Captain</p>

<p>Dumaine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Why does he ask him of me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  What’s he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  E’en a crow o’ th’ same nest: not altogether</p>

<p>so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great</p>

<p>deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward, yet</p>

<p>his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a</p>

<p>retreat he outruns any lackey. Marry, in coming on</p>

<p>he has the cramp.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  If your life be saved, will you undertake</p>

<p>to betray the Florentine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count</p>

<p>Rossillion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  I’ll whisper with the General and know</p>

<p>his pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  I’ll no more drumming. A plague of</p>

<p>all drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to</p>

<p>beguile the supposition of that lascivious young</p>

<p>boy the Count, have I run into this danger. Yet who</p>

<p>would have suspected an ambush where I was</p>

<p>taken?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  There is no remedy, sir, but you must</p>

<p>die. The General says you that have so traitorously</p>

<p>discovered the secrets of your army and made</p>

<p>such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held</p>

<p>can serve the world for no honest use. Therefore</p>

<p>you must die.–Come, headsman, off with his</p>

<p>head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my</p>

<p>death!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  That shall you, and take your leave of</p>

<p>all your friends. <i>[He removes the blindfold.]</i> So,</p>

<p>look about you. Know you any here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  Good morrow, noble captain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  God bless you, Captain Parolles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  God save you, noble captain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Captain, what greeting will you to my</p>

<p>Lord Lafew? I am for France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Good captain, will you give me a copy of</p>

<p>the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count</p>

<p>Rossillion? An I were not a very coward, I’d compel</p>

<p>it of you. But fare you well.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bertram and Lords exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  You are undone, captain–all but your</p>

<p>scarf; that has a knot on ’t yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Who cannot be crushed with a plot?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Soldier</sc>  If you could find out a country where</p>

<p>but women were that had received so much</p>

<p>shame, you might begin an impudent nation. Fare</p>

<p>you well, sir. I am for France too. We shall speak of</p>

<p>you there.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc></p>

<p>Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great,</p>

<p>’Twould burst at this. Captain I’ll be no more,</p>

<p>But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft</p>

<p>As captain shall. Simply the thing I am</p>

<p>Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,</p>

<p>Let him fear this, for it will come to pass</p>

<p>That every braggart shall be found an ass.</p>

<p>Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and Parolles live</p>

<p>Safest in shame. Being fooled, by fool’ry thrive.</p>

<p>There’s place and means for every man alive.</p>

<p>I’ll after them.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>
