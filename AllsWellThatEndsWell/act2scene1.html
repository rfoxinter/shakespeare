<p><center><i>[Flourish cornets. Enter the King, attended, with divers</p>

<p>young Lords, taking leave for the Florentine war;</p>

<p>Bertram Count Rossillion, and Parolles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, young lords. These warlike principles</p>

<p>Do not throw from you.–And you, my lords,</p>

<p>farewell.</p>

<p>Share the advice betwixt you. If both gain all,</p>

<p>The gift doth stretch itself as ’tis received</p>

<p>And is enough for both.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  ’Tis our hope, sir,</p>

<p>After well-entered soldiers, to return</p>

<p>And find your Grace in health.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>No, no, it cannot be. And yet my heart</p>

<p>Will not confess he owes the malady</p>

<p>That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords.</p>

<p>Whether I live or die, be you the sons</p>

<p>Of worthy Frenchmen. Let higher Italy–</p>

<p>Those bated that inherit but the fall</p>

<p>Of the last monarchy–see that you come</p>

<p>Not to woo honor but to wed it. When</p>

<p>The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,</p>

<p>That fame may cry you loud. I say farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Health at your bidding serve your Majesty!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Those girls of Italy, take heed of them.</p>

<p>They say our French lack language to deny</p>

<p>If they demand. Beware of being captives</p>

<p>Before you serve.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lords</sc>  Our hearts receive your warnings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Farewell.–Come hither to me.</p>

<p><center><i>[The King speaks to Attendants, while Bertram,</p>

<p>Parolles, and other Lords come forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[to Bertram]</i></p>

<p>O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc></p>

<p>’Tis not his fault, the spark.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  O, ’tis brave wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc></p>

<p>Most admirable. I have seen those wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>I am commanded here and kept a coil</p>

<p>With “Too young,” and “The next year,” and “’Tis</p>

<p>too early.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc></p>

<p>An thy mind stand to ’t, boy, steal away bravely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc></p>

<p>I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,</p>

<p>Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry</p>

<p>Till honor be bought up, and no sword worn</p>

<p>But one to dance with. By heaven, I’ll steal away!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>There’s honor in the theft.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Commit it, count.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>I am your accessory. And so, farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured</p>

<p>body.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Farewell, captain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Sweet Monsieur Parolles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin.</p>

<p>Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals.</p>

<p>You shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one</p>

<p>Captain Spurio with his cicatrice, an emblem of</p>

<p>war, here on his sinister cheek. It was this very</p>

<p>sword entrenched it. Say to him I live, and observe</p>

<p>his reports for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  We shall, noble captain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Mars dote on you for his novices.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lords exit.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Bertram.]</i> What will you do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  Stay the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble</p>

<p>lords. You have restrained yourself within the list</p>

<p>of too cold an adieu. Be more expressive to them,</p>

<p>for they wear themselves in the cap of the time;</p>

<p>there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move</p>

<p>under the influence of the most received star, and,</p>

<p>though the devil lead the measure, such are to be</p>

<p>followed. After them, and take a more dilated</p>

<p>farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bertram</sc>  And I will do so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Parolles</sc>  Worthy fellows, and like to prove most</p>

<p>sinewy swordmen.     <i><i>[Bertram and Parolles exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lafew, to the King.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  I’ll fee thee to stand up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc> <i>[standing]</i></p>

<p>Then here’s a man stands that has brought his</p>

<p>pardon.</p>

<p>I would you had kneeled, my lord, to ask me mercy,</p>

<p>And that at my bidding you could so stand up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>I would I had, so I had broke thy pate</p>

<p>And asked thee mercy for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Good faith, across.</p>

<p>But, my good lord, ’tis thus: will you be cured</p>

<p>Of your infirmity?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  O, will you eat</p>

<p>No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will</p>

<p>My noble grapes, an if my royal fox</p>

<p>Could reach them. I have seen a medicine</p>

<p>That’s able to breathe life into a stone,</p>

<p>Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary</p>

<p>With sprightly fire and motion, whose simple touch</p>

<p>Is powerful to araise King Pippen, nay,</p>

<p>To give great Charlemagne a pen in ’s hand</p>

<p>And write to her a love line.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  What “her” is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc></p>

<p>Why, Doctor She. My lord, there’s one arrived,</p>

<p>If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honor,</p>

<p>If seriously I may convey my thoughts</p>

<p>In this my light deliverance, I have spoke</p>

<p>With one that in her sex, her years, profession,</p>

<p>Wisdom, and constancy hath amazed me more</p>

<p>Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her–</p>

<p>For that is her demand–and know her business?</p>

<p>That done, laugh well at me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Now, good Lafew,</p>

<p>Bring in the admiration, that we with thee</p>

<p>May spend our wonder too, or take off thine</p>

<p>By wond’ring how thou took’st it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Nay, I’ll fit you,</p>

<p>And not be all day neither.</p>

<p><center><i>[He goes to bring in Helen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Helen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc> <i>[to Helen]</i>  Nay, come your ways.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  This haste hath wings indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lafew</sc>  Nay, come your ways.</p>

<p>This is his Majesty. Say your mind to him.</p>

<p>A traitor you do look like, but such traitors</p>

<p>His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid’s uncle</p>

<p>That dare leave two together. Fare you well.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Now, fair one, does your business follow us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Ay, my good lord,</p>

<p>Gerard de Narbon was my father,</p>

<p>In what he did profess well found.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  I knew him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>The rather will I spare my praises towards him.</p>

<p>Knowing him is enough. On ’s bed of death</p>

<p>Many receipts he gave me, chiefly one</p>

<p>Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,</p>

<p>And of his old experience th’ only darling,</p>

<p>He bade me store up as a triple eye,</p>

<p>Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so,</p>

<p>And hearing your high Majesty is touched</p>

<p>With that malignant cause wherein the honor</p>

<p>Of my dear father’s gift stands chief in power,</p>

<p>I come to tender it and my appliance</p>

<p>With all bound humbleness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  We thank you, maiden,</p>

<p>But may not be so credulous of cure,</p>

<p>When our most learned doctors leave us and</p>

<p>The congregated college have concluded</p>

<p>That laboring art can never ransom nature</p>

<p>From her inaidible estate. I say we must not</p>

<p>So stain our judgment or corrupt our hope</p>

<p>To prostitute our past-cure malady</p>

<p>To empirics, or to dissever so</p>

<p>Our great self and our credit to esteem</p>

<p>A senseless help when help past sense we deem.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>My duty, then, shall pay me for my pains.</p>

<p>I will no more enforce mine office on you,</p>

<p>Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts</p>

<p>A modest one to bear me back again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>I cannot give thee less, to be called grateful.</p>

<p>Thou thought’st to help me, and such thanks I give</p>

<p>As one near death to those that wish him live.</p>

<p>But what at full I know, thou know’st no part,</p>

<p>I knowing all my peril, thou no art.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>What I can do can do no hurt to try</p>

<p>Since you set up your rest ’gainst remedy.</p>

<p>He that of greatest works is finisher</p>

<p>Oft does them by the weakest minister.</p>

<p>So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown</p>

<p>When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown</p>

<p>From simple sources, and great seas have dried</p>

<p>When miracles have by the great’st been denied.</p>

<p>Oft expectation fails, and most oft there</p>

<p>Where most it promises, and oft it hits</p>

<p>Where hope is coldest and despair most shifts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid.</p>

<p>Thy pains, not used, must by thyself be paid.</p>

<p>Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>Inspired merit so by breath is barred.</p>

<p>It is not so with Him that all things knows</p>

<p>As ’tis with us that square our guess by shows;</p>

<p>But most it is presumption in us when</p>

<p>The help of heaven we count the act of men.</p>

<p>Dear sir, to my endeavors give consent.</p>

<p>Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.</p>

<p>I am not an impostor that proclaim</p>

<p>Myself against the level of mine aim,</p>

<p>But know I think and think I know most sure</p>

<p>My art is not past power nor you past cure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Art thou so confident? Within what space</p>

<p>Hop’st thou my cure?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  The greatest grace lending grace,</p>

<p>Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring</p>

<p>Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring;</p>

<p>Ere twice in murk and occidental damp</p>

<p>Moist Hesperus hath quenched her sleepy lamp;</p>

<p>Or four and twenty times the pilot’s glass</p>

<p>Hath told the thievish minutes, how they pass,</p>

<p>What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,</p>

<p>Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Upon thy certainty and confidence</p>

<p>What dar’st thou venture?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  Tax of impudence,</p>

<p>A strumpet’s boldness, a divulged shame;</p>

<p>Traduced by odious ballads, my maiden’s name</p>

<p>Seared otherwise; nay, worse of worst, extended</p>

<p>With vilest torture let my life be ended.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak</p>

<p>His powerful sound within an organ weak,</p>

<p>And what impossibility would slay</p>

<p>In common sense, sense saves another way.</p>

<p>Thy life is dear, for all that life can rate</p>

<p>Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:</p>

<p>Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all</p>

<p>That happiness and prime can happy call.</p>

<p>Thou this to hazard needs must intimate</p>

<p>Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.</p>

<p>Sweet practicer, thy physic I will try,</p>

<p>That ministers thine own death if I die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>If I break time or flinch in property</p>

<p>Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,</p>

<p>And well deserved. Not helping, death’s my fee.</p>

<p>But if I help, what do you promise me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Make thy demand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc>  But will you make it even?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Ay, by my scepter and my hopes of heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helen</sc></p>

<p>Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand</p>

<p>What husband in thy power I will command.</p>

<p>Exempted be from me the arrogance</p>

<p>To choose from forth the royal blood of France,</p>

<p>My low and humble name to propagate</p>

<p>With any branch or image of thy state;</p>

<p>But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know</p>

<p>Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Here is my hand. The premises observed,</p>

<p>Thy will by my performance shall be served.</p>

<p>So make the choice of thy own time, for I,</p>

<p>Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.</p>

<p>More should I question thee, and more I must,</p>

<p>Though more to know could not be more to trust:</p>

<p>From whence thou cam’st, how tended on; but rest</p>

<p>Unquestioned welcome and undoubted blessed.–</p>

<p>Give me some help here, ho!–If thou proceed</p>

<p>As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.</p>
