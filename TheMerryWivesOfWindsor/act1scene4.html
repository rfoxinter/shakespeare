<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  What, John Rugby! <i>[(Enter John</p>

<p>Rugby.)]</i> I pray thee, go to the casement and see if</p>

<p>you can see my master, Master Doctor Caius, coming.</p>

<p>If he do, i’ faith, and find anybody in the</p>

<p>house, here will be an old abusing of God’s patience</p>

<p>and the King’s English.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rugby</span>  I’ll go watch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Go, and we’ll have a posset for ’t</p>

<p>soon at night, in faith, at the latter end of a seacoal</p>

<p>fire. <i>[(Rugby exits.)]</i> An honest, willing, kind fellow</p>

<p>as ever servant shall come in house withal; and, I</p>

<p>warrant you, no telltale nor no breed-bate. His</p>

<p>worst fault is that he is given to prayer. He is something</p>

<p>peevish that way, but nobody but has his</p>

<p>fault. But let that pass. Peter Simple you say your</p>

<p>name is?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simple</span>  Ay, for fault of a better.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  And Master Slender’s your master?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simple</span>  Ay, forsooth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Does he not wear a great round</p>

<p>beard like a glover’s paring knife?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simple</span>  No, forsooth. He hath but a little wee face,</p>

<p>with a little yellow beard, a Cain-colored beard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  A softly-sprited man, is he not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simple</span>  Ay, forsooth. But he is as tall a man of his</p>

<p>hands as any is between this and his head. He hath</p>

<p>fought with a warrener.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  How say you? O, I should remember</p>

<p>him. Does he not hold up his head, as it were,</p>

<p>and strut in his gait?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simple</span>  Yes, indeed, does he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Well, heaven send Anne Page no</p>

<p>worse fortune! Tell Master Parson Evans I will do</p>

<p>what I can for your master. Anne is a good girl, and</p>

<p>I wish–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Rugby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rugby</span>  Out, alas! Here comes my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  We shall all be shent.–Run in here,</p>

<p>good young man. Go into this closet. He will not</p>

<p>stay long. <i>[(Simple exits.)]</i> What, John Rugby!</p>

<p>John! What, John, I say! Go, John, go enquire for</p>

<p>my master. I doubt he be not well, that he comes</p>

<p>not home.     <i><i>[Rugby exits.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[(She sings.)]</i> And down, down, adown ’a, etc.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Doctor Caius.]</i></center></p>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span>  Vat is you sing? I do not like dese toys.</p>

<p>Pray you, go and vetch me in my closet un boitier</p>

<p>vert, a box, a green-a box. Do intend vat I speak?</p>

<p>A green-a box.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Ay, forsooth. I’ll fetch it you.</p>

<p><i>[(Aside.)]</i> I am glad he went not in himself. If he</p>

<p>had found the young man, he would have been</p>

<p>horn-mad.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span>  Fe, fe, fe, fe! Ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je</p>

<p>m’en vais a la cour–la grande affaire.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Quickly with a small box.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Is it this, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span>  Oui, mets-le a mon pocket. Depeche,</p>

<p>quickly. Vere is dat knave Rugby?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  What, John Rugby, John!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Rugby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rugby</span>  Here, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span>  You are John Rugby, and you are Jack</p>

<p>Rugby. Come, take-a your rapier, and come after</p>

<p>my heel to the court.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rugby</span>  ’Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span>  By my trot, I tarry too long. Od’s</p>

<p>me! Qu’ai-j’oublie? Dere is some simples in my</p>

<p>closet dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Ay me! He’ll find the young man</p>

<p>there, and be mad!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Doctor Caius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span>  O diable, diable! Vat is in my closet? Villainy!</p>

<p>Larron! <i>[(Pulling out Simple.)]</i> Rugby, my</p>

<p>rapier!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Good master, be content.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span>  Wherefore shall I be content-a?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  The young man is an honest man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span>  What shall de honest man do in my</p>

<p>closet? Dere is no honest man dat shall come in</p>

<p>my closet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic.</p>

<p>Hear the truth of it. He came of an errand to me</p>

<p>from Parson Hugh.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span>  Vell?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simple</span>  Ay, forsooth. To desire her to–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Peace, I pray you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span>  Peace-a your tongue.–Speak-a your</p>

<p>tale.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simple</span>  To desire this honest gentlewoman, your</p>

<p>maid, to speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page</p>

<p>for my master in the way of marriage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  This is all, indeed, la! But I’ll ne’er</p>

<p>put my finger in the fire, and need not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span> <i>[to Simple]</i>  Sir Hugh send-a you?–</p>

<p>Rugby, baille me some paper.–Tarry you a little-a</p>

<p>while.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Rugby brings paper, and Doctor Caius writes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span> <i>[aside to Simple]</i>  I am glad he is so</p>

<p>quiet. If he had been throughly moved, you should</p>

<p>have heard him so loud and so melancholy. But</p>

<p>notwithstanding, man, I’ll do you your master</p>

<p>what good I can. And the very yea and the no is,</p>

<p>the French doctor, my master–I may call him my</p>

<p>master, look you, for I keep his house, and I wash,</p>

<p>wring, brew, bake, scour, dress meat and drink,</p>

<p>make the beds, and do all myself–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simple</span> <i>[aside to Quickly]</i>  ’Tis a great charge to come</p>

<p>under one body’s hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span> <i>[aside to Simple]</i>  Are you advised o’</p>

<p>that? You shall find it a great charge. And to be up</p>

<p>early and down late. But notwithstanding–to tell</p>

<p>you in your ear; I would have no words of it–my</p>

<p>master himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding that, I know Anne’s mind.</p>

<p>That’s neither here nor there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span> <i>[handing paper to Simple]</i>  You, jack’nape,</p>

<p>give-a this letter to Sir Hugh. By gar, it is a</p>

<p>shallenge. I will cut his troat in de park, and I will</p>

<p>teach a scurvy jackanape priest to meddle or</p>

<p>make. You may be gone. It is not good you tarry</p>

<p>here.–By gar, I will cut all his two stones. By gar,</p>

<p>he shall not have a stone to throw at his dog.</p>

<p><center><i>[Simple exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Alas, he speaks but for his friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span>  It is no matter-a ver dat. Do not you tell-a</p>

<p>me dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I</p>

<p>vill kill de jack priest; and I have appointed mine</p>

<p>Host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar,</p>

<p>I will myself have Anne Page.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall</p>

<p>be well. We must give folks leave to prate. What</p>

<p>the goodyear!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> <span class='sc'>Caius</span>  Rugby, come to the court with me. <i>[(To</p>

<p>Mistress Quickly.)]</i> By gar, if I have not Anne Page,</p>

<p>I shall turn your head out of my door.–Follow my</p>

<p>heels, Rugby.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  You shall have Anne–</p>

<p><center><i>[Caius and Rugby exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>fool’s head of your own. No, I know Anne’s mind</p>

<p>for that. Never a woman in Windsor knows more</p>

<p>of Anne’s mind than I do, nor can do more than I</p>

<p>do with her, I thank heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fenton</span> <i>[within]</i>  Who’s within there, ho?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Who’s there, I trow? Come near the</p>

<p>house, I pray you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fenton.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fenton</span>  How now, good woman? How dost thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  The better that it pleases your good</p>

<p>Worship to ask.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fenton</span>  What news? How does pretty Mistress Anne?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and</p>

<p>honest, and gentle; and one that is your friend, I</p>

<p>can tell you that by the way, I praise heaven for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fenton</span>  Shall I do any good, think’st thou? Shall I not</p>

<p>lose my suit?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Troth, sir, all is in His hands above.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I’ll be sworn</p>

<p>on a book she loves you. Have not your Worship a</p>

<p>wart above your eye?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fenton</span>  Yes, marry, have I. What of that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Well, thereby hangs a tale. Good</p>

<p>faith, it is such another Nan! But, I detest, an honest</p>

<p>maid as ever broke bread. We had an hour’s</p>

<p>talk of that wart. I shall never laugh but in that</p>

<p>maid’s company. But, indeed, she is given too</p>

<p>much to allicholy and musing. But, for you,–well,</p>

<p>go to.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fenton</span>  Well, I shall see her today. Hold, there’s</p>

<p>money for thee. <i>[(He hands her money.)]</i> Let me</p>

<p>have thy voice in my behalf. If thou see’st her before</p>

<p>me, commend me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Will I? I’ faith, that we will. And I</p>

<p>will tell your Worship more of the wart the next</p>

<p>time we have confidence, and of other wooers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fenton</span>  Well, farewell. I am in great haste now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Farewell to your Worship.</p>

<p><center><i>[Fenton exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Truly an honest gentleman–but Anne loves him</p>

<p>not, for I know Anne’s mind as well as another</p>

<p>does. Out upon ’t! What have I forgot?</p>
