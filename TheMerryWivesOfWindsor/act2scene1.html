<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Page reading a letter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  What, have I ’scaped love letters in</p>

<p>the holiday time of my beauty, and am I now a</p>

<p>subject for them? Let me see.</p>

<p><center><i>[She reads.]</i></center></p>

<p>Ask me no reason why I love you, for though Love</p>

<p>use Reason for his precisian, he admits him not for</p>

<p>his counselor. You are not young; no more am I. Go</p>

<p>to, then, there’s sympathy. You are merry; so am I.</p>

<p>Ha, ha, then, there’s more sympathy. You love sack,</p>

<p>and so do I. Would you desire better sympathy? Let</p>

<p>it suffice thee, Mistress Page–at the least, if the love</p>

<p>of soldier can suffice–that I love thee. I will not say</p>

<p>pity me–’tis not a soldier-like phrase–but I say love</p>

<p>me. By me,</p>

<p>     <i>Thine own true knight,</i></p>

<p>     <i>By day or night,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Or any kind of light,</i></p>

<p>     <i>With all his might</i></p>

<p>     <i>For thee to fight,</i></p>

<p>John Falstaff.</p>

<p>What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked</p>

<p>world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with</p>

<p>age, to show himself a young gallant! What an</p>

<p>unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard</p>

<p>picked–with the devil’s name!–out of my conversation,</p>

<p>that he dares in this manner assay me?</p>

<p>Why, he hath not been thrice in my company!</p>

<p>What should I say to him? I was then frugal of my</p>

<p>mirth. Heaven forgive me! Why, I’ll exhibit a bill</p>

<p>in the Parliament for the putting down of men.</p>

<p>How shall I be revenged on him? For revenged I</p>

<p>will be, as sure as his guts are made of puddings.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Ford.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Mistress Page! Trust me, I was going to</p>

<p>your house.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  And, trust me, I was coming to you.</p>

<p>You look very ill.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Nay, I’ll ne’er believe that. I have to</p>

<p>show to the contrary.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Faith, but you do, in my mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Well, I do, then. Yet I say I could show</p>

<p>you to the contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some</p>

<p>counsel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  What’s the matter, woman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  O woman, if it were not for one trifling</p>

<p>respect, I could come to such honor!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Hang the trifle, woman; take the honor.</p>

<p>What is it? Dispense with trifles. What is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  If I would but go to hell for an eternal</p>

<p>moment or so, I could be knighted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  What, thou liest! Sir Alice Ford? These</p>

<p>knights will hack, and so thou shouldst not alter</p>

<p>the article of thy gentry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  We burn daylight. Here, read, read. Perceive</p>

<p>how I might be knighted. <i>[(She gives a paper</p>

<p>to Mistress Page, who reads it.)]</i> I shall think the</p>

<p>worse of fat men as long as I have an eye to make</p>

<p>difference of men’s liking. And yet he would not</p>

<p>swear; praised women’s modesty; and gave such</p>

<p>orderly and well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness</p>

<p>that I would have sworn his disposition</p>

<p>would have gone to the truth of his words. But</p>

<p>they do no more adhere and keep place together</p>

<p>than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of</p>

<p>“Greensleeves.” What tempest, I trow, threw this</p>

<p>whale, with so many tuns of oil in his belly, ashore</p>

<p>at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on him? I</p>

<p>think the best way were to entertain him with hope</p>

<p>till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his</p>

<p>own grease. Did you ever hear the like?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Letter for letter, but that the name of</p>

<p>Page and Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this</p>

<p>mystery of ill opinions, here’s the twin brother of</p>

<p>thy letter. <i>[(She gives a paper to Mistress Ford, who</p>

<p>reads it.)]</i> But let thine inherit first, for I protest</p>

<p>mine never shall. I warrant he hath a thousand of</p>

<p>these letters writ with blank space for different</p>

<p>names–sure, more–and these are of the second</p>

<p>edition. He will print them, out of doubt; for he</p>

<p>cares not what he puts into the press, when he</p>

<p>would put us two. I had rather be a giantess and lie</p>

<p>under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you twenty</p>

<p>lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Why, this is the very same–the very</p>

<p>hand, the very words. What doth he think of us?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Nay, I know not. It makes me almost</p>

<p>ready to wrangle with mine own honesty. I’ll entertain</p>

<p>myself like one that I am not acquainted</p>

<p>withal; for, sure, unless he know some strain in</p>

<p>me that I know not myself, he would never have</p>

<p>boarded me in this fury.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  “Boarding” call you it? I’ll be sure to</p>

<p>keep him above deck.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  So will I. If he come under my hatches,</p>

<p>I’ll never to sea again. Let’s be revenged on him.</p>

<p>Let’s appoint him a meeting, give him a show of</p>

<p>comfort in his suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited</p>

<p>delay till he hath pawned his horses to mine</p>

<p>Host of the Garter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Nay, I will consent to act any villainy</p>

<p>against him that may not sully the chariness of our</p>

<p>honesty. O, that my husband saw this letter! It</p>

<p>would give eternal food to his jealousy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Why, look where he comes, and my</p>

<p>good man too. He’s as far from jealousy as I am</p>

<p>from giving him cause, and that, I hope, is an</p>

<p>unmeasurable distance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  You are the happier woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Let’s consult together against this greasy</p>

<p>knight. Come hither.     <i><i>[They talk aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ford with Pistol, and Page with Nym.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Well, I hope it be not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span></p>

<p>Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs.</p>

<p>Sir John affects thy wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Why, sir, my wife is not young.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span></p>

<p>He woos both high and low, both rich and poor,</p>

<p>Both young and old, one with another, Ford.</p>

<p>He loves the gallimaufry. Ford, perpend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Love my wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span></p>

<p>With liver burning hot. Prevent,</p>

<p>Or go thou like Sir Acteon, he,</p>

<p>With Ringwood at thy heels.</p>

<p>O, odious is the name!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  What name, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  The horn, I say. Farewell.</p>

<p>Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by</p>

<p>night.</p>

<p>Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo birds do</p>

<p>sing.–</p>

<p>Away, Sir Corporal Nym.–Believe it, Page. He</p>

<p>speaks sense.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[aside]</i>  I will be patient. I will find out this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span> <i>[to Page]</i>  And this is true. I like not the humor of</p>

<p>lying. He hath wronged me in some humors. I</p>

<p>should have borne the humored letter to her; but I</p>

<p>have a sword, and it shall bite upon my necessity.</p>

<p>He loves your wife; there’s the short and the long.</p>

<p>My name is Corporal Nym. I speak and I avouch.</p>

<p>’Tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your</p>

<p>wife. Adieu. I love not the humor of bread and</p>

<p>cheese. Adieu.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span> <i>[aside]</i>  “The humor of it,” quoth he? Here’s a fellow</p>

<p>frights English out of his wits.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[aside]</i>  I will seek out Falstaff.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span> <i>[aside]</i>  I never heard such a drawling, affecting</p>

<p>rogue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[aside]</i>  If I do find it–well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span> <i>[aside]</i>  I will not believe such a Cataian, though</p>

<p>the priest o’ th’ town commended him for a true</p>

<p>man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[aside]</i>  ’Twas a good sensible fellow–well.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Mistress Page and Mistress Ford come forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span> <i>[to Mistress Page]</i>  How now, Meg?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Whither go you, George? Hark you.</p>

<p><center><i>[They talk aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[to Ford]</i>  How now, sweet Frank? Why</p>

<p>art thou melancholy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  I melancholy? I am not melancholy. Get you</p>

<p>home. Go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Faith, thou hast some crochets in thy</p>

<p>head now.–Will you go, Mistress Page?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Have with you.–You’ll come to dinner,</p>

<p>George? <i>[(Aside to Mistress Ford.)]</i> Look who</p>

<p>comes yonder.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Quickly.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>She shall be our messenger to this paltry knight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Trust me, I thought on her. She’ll fit it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span> <i>[to Mistress Quickly]</i>  You are come to</p>

<p>see my daughter Anne?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Ay, forsooth. And, I pray, how does</p>

<p>good Mistress Anne?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Go in with us and see. We have an</p>

<p>hour’s talk with you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Mistress Page, Mistress Ford, and</p>

<p>Mistress Quickly exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  How now, Master Ford?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  You heard what this knave told me, did you not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  Yes, and you heard what the other told me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Do you think there is truth in them?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  Hang ’em, slaves! I do not think the knight</p>

<p>would offer it. But these that accuse him in his intent</p>

<p>towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded</p>

<p>men, very rogues, now they be out of service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Were they his men?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  Marry, were they.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at</p>

<p>the Garter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage</p>

<p>toward my wife, I would turn her loose to him;</p>

<p>and what he gets more of her than sharp words, let</p>

<p>it lie on my head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  I do not misdoubt my wife, but I would be loath</p>

<p>to turn them together. A man may be too confident.</p>

<p>I would have nothing lie on my head. I cannot</p>

<p>be thus satisfied.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Host.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  Look where my ranting Host of the Garter</p>

<p>comes. There is either liquor in his pate or money</p>

<p>in his purse when he looks so merrily.–How now,</p>

<p>mine Host?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Host</span>  How now, bullyrook? Thou ’rt a gentleman.–</p>

<p>Cavaleiro Justice, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Shallow.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  I follow, mine Host, I follow.–Good even</p>

<p>and twenty, good Master Page. Master Page, will</p>

<p>you go with us? We have sport in hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Host</span>  Tell him, Cavaleiro Justice; tell him, bullyrook.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  Sir, there is a fray to be fought between</p>

<p>Sir Hugh the Welsh priest and Caius the French</p>

<p>doctor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Good mine Host o’ th’ Garter, a word with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Host</span>  What say’st thou, my bullyrook?</p>

<p><center><i>[The Host and Ford talk aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span> <i>[to Page]</i>  Will you go with us to behold it?</p>

<p>My merry Host hath had the measuring of their</p>

<p>weapons and, I think, hath appointed them contrary</p>

<p>places; for, believe me, I hear the parson is no</p>

<p>jester. Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.</p>

<p><center><i>[Shallow and Page talk aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Host</span> <i>[to Ford]</i>  Hast thou no suit against my knight,</p>

<p>my guest cavalier?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  None, I protest. But I’ll give you a pottle of</p>

<p>burnt sack to give me recourse to him, and tell him</p>

<p>my name is Brook–only for a jest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Host</span>  My hand, bully. Thou shalt have egress and</p>

<p>regress–said I well?–and thy name shall be</p>

<p>Brook. It is a merry knight. <i>[(To Shallow and</p>

<p>Page.)]</i> Will you go, ameers?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  Have with you, mine Host.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill</p>

<p>in his rapier.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these</p>

<p>times you stand on distance–your passes, stoccados,</p>

<p>and I know not what. ’Tis the heart, Master</p>

<p>Page; ’tis here, ’tis here. I have seen the time, with</p>

<p>my long sword I would have made you four tall</p>

<p>fellows skip like rats.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Host</span>  Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  Have with you. I had rather hear them scold</p>

<p>than fight.     <i><i>[Page, Host, and Shallow exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Though Page be a secure fool and stands so</p>

<p>firmly on his wife’s frailty, yet I cannot put off my</p>

<p>opinion so easily. She was in his company at Page’s</p>

<p>house, and what they made there I know not. Well,</p>

<p>I will look further into ’t, and I have a disguise to</p>

<p>sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not my</p>

<p>labor. If she be otherwise, ’tis labor well bestowed.</p>
