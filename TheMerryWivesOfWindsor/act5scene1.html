<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff and Mistress Quickly.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Prithee, no more prattling. Go. I’ll hold. This</p>

<p>is the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd numbers.</p>

<p>Away, go. They say there is divinity in odd</p>

<p>numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death.</p>

<p>Away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  I’ll provide you a chain, and I’ll do</p>

<p>what I can to get you a pair of horns.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Away, I say! Time wears. Hold up your head,</p>

<p>and mince.     <i><i>[Mistress Quickly exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ford disguised as Brook.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the</p>

<p>matter will be known tonight or never. Be you in</p>

<p>the park about midnight, at Herne’s oak, and you</p>

<p>shall see wonders.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as</p>

<p>you told me you had appointed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  I went to her, Master Brook, as you see,</p>

<p>like a poor old man, but I came from her, Master</p>

<p>Brook, like a poor old woman. That same knave</p>

<p>Ford, her husband, hath the finest mad devil of</p>

<p>jealousy in him, Master Brook, that ever governed</p>

<p>frenzy. I will tell you, he beat me grievously,</p>

<p>in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of man,</p>

<p>Master Brook, I fear not Goliath with a weaver’s</p>

<p>beam, because I know also life is a shuttle. I am in</p>

<p>haste. Go along with me; I’ll tell you all, Master</p>

<p>Brook. Since I plucked geese, played truant, and</p>

<p>whipped top, I knew not what ’twas to be beaten</p>

<p>till lately. Follow me. I’ll tell you strange things of</p>

<p>this knave Ford, on whom tonight I will be revenged,</p>

<p>and I will deliver his wife into your hand.</p>

<p>Follow. Strange things in hand, Master Brook!</p>

<p>Follow.</p>
