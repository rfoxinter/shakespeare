<p><center><i>[Enter Justice Shallow, Slender, and Sir Hugh Evans.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Sir Hugh, persuade me not. I will make a</p>

<p>Star-Chamber matter of it. If he were twenty Sir</p>

<p>John Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow,</p>

<p>Esquire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  In the county of Gloucester, Justice of Peace</p>

<p>and Coram.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Ay, Cousin Slender, and Custalorum.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Ay, and Ratolorum too; and a gentleman born,</p>

<p>Master Parson, who writes himself “Armigero”</p>

<p>in any bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation–</p>

<p>“Armigero!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Ay, that I do, and have done any time these</p>

<p>three hundred years.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  All his successors gone before him hath</p>

<p>done ’t, and all his ancestors that come after him</p>

<p>may. They may give the dozen white luces in their</p>

<p>coat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  It is an old coat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  The dozen white louses do become an old</p>

<p>coat well. It agrees well, passant. It is a familiar</p>

<p>beast to man and signifies love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  The luce is the fresh fish. The salt fish is an</p>

<p>old coat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  I may quarter, coz.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  You may, by marrying.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Not a whit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Yes, py ’r Lady. If he has a quarter of your</p>

<p>coat, there is but three skirts for yourself, in my</p>

<p>simple conjectures. But that is all one. If Sir John</p>

<p>Falstaff have committed disparagements unto you,</p>

<p>I am of the Church, and will be glad to do my</p>

<p>benevolence to make atonements and compromises</p>

<p>between you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  The Council shall hear it; it is a riot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  It is not meet the Council hear a riot. There</p>

<p>is no fear of Got in a riot. The Council, look you,</p>

<p>shall desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear</p>

<p>a riot. Take your visaments in that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Ha! O’ my life, if I were young again, the</p>

<p>sword should end it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  It is petter that friends is the sword, and end</p>

<p>it. And there is also another device in my prain,</p>

<p>which peradventure prings goot discretions with</p>

<p>it. There is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master</p>

<p>Thomas Page, which is pretty virginity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair</p>

<p>and speaks small like a woman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  It is that fery person for all the ’orld, as just</p>

<p>as you will desire. And seven hundred pounds of</p>

<p>moneys, and gold, and silver, is her grandsire upon</p>

<p>his death’s-bed (Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!)</p>

<p>give, when she is able to overtake seventeen</p>

<p>years old. It were a goot motion if we leave our</p>

<p>pribbles and prabbles, and desire a marriage between</p>

<p>Master Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred</p>

<p>pound?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Ay, and her father is make her a petter</p>

<p>penny.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  I know the young gentlewoman. She has</p>

<p>good gifts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is</p>

<p>goot gifts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff</p>

<p>there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I</p>

<p>do despise one that is false, or as I despise one that</p>

<p>is not true. The knight Sir John is there, and I beseech</p>

<p>you be ruled by your well-willers. I will peat</p>

<p>the door for Master Page. <i>[He knocks.]</i> What ho?</p>

<p>Got pless your house here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Here is Got’s plessing, and your friend, and</p>

<p>Justice Shallow, and here young Master Slender,</p>

<p>that peradventures shall tell you another tale, if</p>

<p>matters grow to your likings.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Master Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  I am glad to see your Worships well. I thank you</p>

<p>for my venison, Master Shallow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Master Page, I am glad to see you. Much</p>

<p>good do it your good heart! I wished your venison</p>

<p>better; it was ill killed. How doth good Mistress</p>

<p>Page? And I thank you always with my heart, la,</p>

<p>with my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Sir, I thank you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I</p>

<p>heard say he was outrun on Cotsall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  It could not be judged, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  You’ll not confess, you’ll not confess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  That he will not. ’Tis your fault, ’tis your</p>

<p>fault. ’Tis a good dog.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  A cur, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Sir, he’s a good dog and a fair dog. Can there</p>

<p>be more said? He is good and fair. Is Sir John Falstaff</p>

<p>here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Sir, he is within, and I would I could do a good</p>

<p>office between you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  He hath wronged me, Master Page.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  If it be confessed, it is not redressed. Is not</p>

<p>that so, Master Page? He hath wronged me, indeed</p>

<p>he hath; at a word, he hath. Believe me. Robert</p>

<p>Shallow, Esquire, saith he is wronged.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff, Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Here comes Sir John.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Now, Master Shallow, you’ll complain of me</p>

<p>to the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my</p>

<p>deer, and broke open my lodge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  But not kissed your keeper’s daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Tut, a pin. This shall be answered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I will answer it straight: I have done all this.</p>

<p>That is now answered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  The Council shall know this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  ’Twere better for you if it were known in</p>

<p>counsel. You’ll be laughed at.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Pauca verba, Sir John, good worts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Good worts? Good cabbage!–Slender, I</p>

<p>broke your head. What matter have you against</p>

<p>me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against</p>

<p>you and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,</p>

<p>Nym, and Pistol.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  You Banbury cheese!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Ay, it is no matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  How now, Mephostophilus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Ay, it is no matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc>  Slice, I say! Pauca, pauca. Slice, that’s my humor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc> <i>[to Shallow]</i>  Where’s Simple, my man?</p>

<p>Can you tell, cousin?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand;</p>

<p>there is three umpires in this matter, as I understand:</p>

<p>that is, Master Page (fidelicet Master Page);</p>

<p>and there is myself (fidelicet myself); and the three</p>

<p>party is, lastly and finally, mine Host of the Garter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  We three to hear it and end it between them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Fery goot. I will make a prief of it in my</p>

<p>notebook, and we will afterwards ’ork upon the</p>

<p>cause with as great discreetly as we can.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Pistol.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  He hears with ears.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  The tevil and his tam! What phrase is this,</p>

<p>“He hears with ear”? Why, it is affectations.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Pistol, did you pick Master Slender’s purse?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Ay, by these gloves, did he–or I would I</p>

<p>might never come in mine own great chamber</p>

<p>again else–of seven groats in mill-sixpences,</p>

<p>and two Edward shovel-boards that cost me two</p>

<p>shilling and twopence apiece of Yed Miller, by</p>

<p>these gloves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Is this true, Pistol?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  No, it is false, if it is a pickpurse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Ha, thou mountain foreigner!–Sir John and</p>

<p>master mine, I combat challenge of this latten</p>

<p>bilbo.–Word of denial in thy labras here! Word of</p>

<p>denial! Froth and scum, thou liest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc> <i>[indicating Nym]</i>  By these gloves, then ’twas</p>

<p>he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc>  Be avised, sir, and pass good humors. I will say</p>

<p>“marry trap with you” if you run the nuthook’s</p>

<p>humor on me. That is the very note of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  By this hat, then, he in the red face had it.</p>

<p>For, though I cannot remember what I did when</p>

<p>you made me drunk, yet I am not altogether an</p>

<p>ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What say you, Scarlet and John?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman</p>

<p>had drunk himself out of his five sentences.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  It is “his five senses.” Fie, what the ignorance</p>

<p>is!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc> <i>[to Falstaff]</i>  And being fap, sir, was, as</p>

<p>they say, cashiered. And so conclusions passed the</p>

<p>careers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Ay, you spake in Latin then too. But ’tis no</p>

<p>matter. I’ll ne’er be drunk whilst I live again but in</p>

<p>honest, civil, godly company, for this trick. If I be</p>

<p>drunk, I’ll be drunk with those that have the fear of</p>

<p>God, and not with drunken knaves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  So Got ’udge me, that is a virtuous mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen.</p>

<p>You hear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Anne Page with wine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Nay, daughter, carry the wine in. We’ll drink</p>

<p>within.     <i><i>[Anne Page exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  O heaven, this is Mistress Anne Page.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Ford and Mistress Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  How now, Mistress Ford?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well</p>

<p>met. By your leave, good mistress.     <i><i>[He kisses her.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome.–Come, we</p>

<p>have a hot venison pasty to dinner. Come, gentlemen,</p>

<p>I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Slender, Shallow, and Sir Hugh exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  I had rather than forty shillings I had my</p>

<p>book of Songs and Sonnets here!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Simple.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Simple? Where have you been? I must</p>

<p>wait on myself, must I? You have not the Book of</p>

<p>Riddles about you, have you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simple</sc>  Book of Riddles? Why, did you not lend it to</p>

<p>Alice Shortcake upon Allhallowmas last, a fortnight</p>

<p>afore Michaelmas?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc> <i>[to Slender]</i>  Come, coz; come, coz. We stay</p>

<p>for you. A word with you, coz. Marry, this, coz:</p>

<p>there is, as ’twere, a tender, a kind of tender, made</p>

<p>afar off by Sir Hugh here. Do you understand me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable. If it be</p>

<p>so, I shall do that that is reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Nay, but understand me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  So I do, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Give ear to his motions, Master Slender. I</p>

<p>will description the matter to you, if you be capacity</p>

<p>of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says. I</p>

<p>pray you, pardon me. He’s a Justice of Peace in his</p>

<p>country, simple though I stand here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  But that is not the question. The question is</p>

<p>concerning your marriage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Ay, there’s the point, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Marry, is it, the very point of it–to Mistress</p>

<p>Anne Page.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any</p>

<p>reasonable demands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  But can you affection the ’oman? Let us command</p>

<p>to know that of your mouth, or of your lips;</p>

<p>for divers philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of</p>

<p>the mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your</p>

<p>good will to the maid?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one</p>

<p>that would do reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Nay, Got’s lords and His ladies! You must</p>

<p>speak positable, if you can carry her your desires</p>

<p>towards her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  That you must. Will you, upon good dowry,</p>

<p>marry her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  I will do a greater thing than that, upon your</p>

<p>request, cousin, in any reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz.</p>

<p>What I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the</p>

<p>maid?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  I will marry her, sir, at your request. But if</p>

<p>there be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven</p>

<p>may decrease it upon better acquaintance, when</p>

<p>we are married and have more occasion to know</p>

<p>one another. I hope upon familiarity will grow</p>

<p>more content. But if you say “Marry her,” I will</p>

<p>marry her. That I am freely dissolved, and</p>

<p>dissolutely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  It is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is</p>

<p>in the ’ord “dissolutely.” The ’ort is, according to</p>

<p>our meaning, “resolutely.” His meaning is good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Ay, I think my cousin meant well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!</p>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised</p>

<p>dagger with a master of fence–three veneys for a</p>

<p>dish of stewed prunes–and, by my troth, I cannot</p>

<p>abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc>  Ay, indeed, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  That’s meat and drink to me, now. I have</p>

<p>seen Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken</p>

<p>him by the chain. But, I warrant you, the women</p>
