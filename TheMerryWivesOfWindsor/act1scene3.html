<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff, Host, Bardolph, Nym, Pistol,</p>

<p>and Robin, Falstaff’s Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Mine Host of the Garter!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  What says my bullyrook? Speak scholarly and</p>

<p>wisely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Truly, mine Host, I must turn away some of</p>

<p>my followers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Discard, bully Hercules, cashier. Let them wag;</p>

<p>trot, trot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I sit at ten pounds a week.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Thou ’rt an emperor–Caesar, Keiser, and</p>

<p>Pheazar. I will entertain Bardolph. He shall draw,</p>

<p>he shall tap. Said I well, bully Hector?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Do so, good mine Host.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  I have spoke. Let him follow.–Let me see thee</p>

<p>froth and lime. I am at a word. Follow.</p>

<p><center><i>[Host exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good</p>

<p>trade. An old cloak makes a new jerkin, a withered</p>

<p>servingman a fresh tapster. Go. Adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  It is a life that I have desired. I will thrive.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  O base Hungarian wight, wilt thou the spigot</p>

<p>wield?     <i><i>[Bardolph exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc>  He was gotten in drink. Is not the humor</p>

<p>conceited?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox.</p>

<p>His thefts were too open. His filching was like an</p>

<p>unskillful singer; he kept not time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc>  The good humor is to steal at a minute’s rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  “Convey,” the wise it call. “Steal”? Foh, a fico</p>

<p>for the phrase!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Why, then, let kibes ensue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  There is no remedy. I must cony-catch, I</p>

<p>must shift.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Young ravens must have food.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Which of you know Ford of this town?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  I ken the wight. He is of substance good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  My honest lads, I will tell you what I am</p>

<p>about.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Two yards and more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  No quips now, Pistol. Indeed, I am in the</p>

<p>waist two yards about, but I am now about no</p>

<p>waste; I am about thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make</p>

<p>love to Ford’s wife. I spy entertainment in her. She</p>

<p>discourses; she carves; she gives the leer of invitation.</p>

<p>I can construe the action of her familiar style;</p>

<p>and the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished</p>

<p>rightly, is “I am Sir John Falstaff’s.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc> <i>[aside to Nym]</i>  He hath studied her will and</p>

<p>translated her will–out of honesty into English.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc> <i>[aside to Pistol]</i>  The anchor is deep. Will that</p>

<p>humor pass?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Now, the report goes, she has all the rule of</p>

<p>her husband’s purse. He hath a legion of angels.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc> <i>[aside to Nym]</i>  As many devils entertain, and</p>

<p>“To her, boy,” say I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc> <i>[aside to Pistol]</i>  The humor rises; it is good.</p>

<p>Humor me the angels.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[showing two papers]</i>  I have writ me here a</p>

<p>letter to her; and here another to Page’s wife, who</p>

<p>even now gave me good eyes too, examined my</p>

<p>parts with most judicious oeillades. Sometimes</p>

<p>the beam of her view gilded my foot, sometimes</p>

<p>my portly belly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc> <i>[aside to Nym]</i>  Then did the sun on dunghill</p>

<p>shine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc> <i>[aside to Pistol]</i>  I thank thee for that humor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  O, she did so course o’er my exteriors with</p>

<p>such a greedy intention that the appetite of her</p>

<p>eye did seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass.</p>

<p>Here’s another letter to her. She bears the purse</p>

<p>too; she is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty.</p>

<p>I will be cheaters to them both, and they shall be</p>

<p>exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West</p>

<p>Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou</p>

<p>this letter to Mistress Page–and thou this to Mistress</p>

<p>Ford. We will thrive, lads, we will thrive.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc></p>

<p>Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,</p>

<p>And by my side wear steel? Then Lucifer take all!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc> <i>[to Falstaff]</i>  I will run no base humor. Here, take</p>

<p>the humor-letter. I will keep the havior of</p>

<p>reputation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[giving papers to Robin]</i></p>

<p>Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;</p>

<p>Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.–</p>

<p>Rogues, hence, avaunt, vanish like hailstones, go,</p>

<p>Trudge, plod away i’ th’ hoof, seek shelter, pack!</p>

<p>Falstaff will learn the humor of the age:</p>

<p>French thrift, you rogues–myself and skirted page.</p>

<p><center><i>[Falstaff and Robin exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc></p>

<p>Let vultures gripe thy guts! For gourd and fullam</p>

<p>holds,</p>

<p>And high and low beguiles the rich and poor.</p>

<p>Tester I’ll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,</p>

<p>Base Phrygian Turk!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc>  I have operations which be humors of revenge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Wilt thou revenge?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc>  By welkin and her star!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  With wit or steel?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc>  With both the humors, I. I will discuss the</p>

<p>humor of this love to Ford.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc></p>

<p>And I to Page shall eke unfold</p>

<p>   <i>How Falstaff, varlet vile,</i></p>

<p>His dove will prove, his gold will hold,</p>

<p>   <i>And his soft couch defile.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc>  My humor shall not cool. I will incense Ford to</p>

<p>deal with poison. I will possess him with yellowness,</p>

<p>for the revolt of mine is dangerous. That is</p>

<p>my true humor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Thou art the Mars of malcontents. I second</p>

<p>thee. Troop on.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
