<p><center><i>[Enter Robin followed by Mistress Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Nay, keep your way, little gallant. You</p>

<p>were wont to be a follower, but now you are a</p>

<p>leader. Whether had you rather–lead mine eyes,</p>

<p>or eye your master’s heels?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc>  I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man</p>

<p>than follow him like a dwarf.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  O, you are a flattering boy! Now I see</p>

<p>you’ll be a courtier.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ford.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at</p>

<p>home?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Ay, and as idle as she may hang together, for</p>

<p>want of company. I think if your husbands were</p>

<p>dead, you two would marry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Be sure of that–two other husbands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Where had you this pretty weathercock?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  I cannot tell what the dickens his name</p>

<p>is my husband had him of.–What do you call your</p>

<p>knight’s name, sirrah?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc>  Sir John Falstaff.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Sir John Falstaff!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  He, he. I can never hit on ’s name.</p>

<p>There is such a league between my goodman and</p>

<p>he. Is your wife at home indeed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Indeed, she is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  By your leave, sir. I am sick till I see</p>

<p>her.     <i><i>[Mistress Page and Robin exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Has Page any brains? Hath he any eyes? Hath</p>

<p>he any thinking? Sure they sleep; he hath no use</p>

<p>of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty</p>

<p>mile as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank</p>

<p>twelve score. He pieces out his wife’s inclination.</p>

<p>He gives her folly motion and advantage. And now</p>

<p>she’s going to my wife, and Falstaff’s boy with her.</p>

<p>A man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And</p>

<p>Falstaff’s boy with her! Good plots they are laid,</p>

<p>and our revolted wives share damnation together.</p>

<p>Well, I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck</p>

<p>the borrowed veil of modesty from the so-seeming</p>

<p>Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure</p>

<p>and willful Acteon, and to these violent proceedings</p>

<p>all my neighbors shall cry aim. <i>[A clock</p>

<p>strikes.]</i> The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance</p>

<p>bids me search. There I shall find Falstaff. I</p>

<p>shall be rather praised for this than mocked, for it</p>

<p>is as positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is</p>

<p>there. I will go.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Page, Shallow, Slender, Host, Sir Hugh</p>

<p>Evans, Doctor Caius, and Rugby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc> <sc>Page</sc> <sc>Etc</sc>.  Well met, Master Ford.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Trust me, a good knot. I have good cheer at</p>

<p>home, and I pray you all go with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  I must excuse myself, Master Ford.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  And so must I, sir. We have appointed to dine</p>

<p>with Mistress Anne, and I would not break with</p>

<p>her for more money than I’ll speak of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  We have lingered about a match between</p>

<p>Anne Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we</p>

<p>shall have our answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  I hope I have your good will, Father Page.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  You have, Master Slender. I stand wholly for</p>

<p>you.–But my wife, Master Doctor, is for you</p>

<p>altogether.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc> <sc>Caius</sc>  Ay, be-gar, and de maid is love-a me! My</p>

<p>nursh-a Quickly tell me so mush.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc> <i>[to Page]</i>  What say you to young Master Fenton?</p>

<p>He capers, he dances, he has eyes of youth, he</p>

<p>writes verses, he speaks holiday, he smells April</p>

<p>and May. He will carry ’t, he will carry ’t. ’Tis in his</p>

<p>buttons he will carry ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman</p>

<p>is of no having. He kept company with the</p>

<p>wild Prince and Poins. He is of too high a region;</p>

<p>he knows too much. No, he shall not knit a knot in</p>

<p>his fortunes with the finger of my substance. If he</p>

<p>take her, let him take her simply. The wealth I have</p>

<p>waits on my consent, and my consent goes not that</p>

<p>way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  I beseech you heartily, some of you go home</p>

<p>with me to dinner. Besides your cheer, you shall</p>

<p>have sport: I will show you a monster. Master Doctor,</p>

<p>you shall go.–So shall you, Master Page.–</p>

<p>And you, Sir Hugh.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Well, fare you well. We shall have the freer</p>

<p>wooing at Master Page’s.</p>

<p><center><i>[Shallow and Slender exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc> <sc>Caius</sc>  Go home, John Rugby. I come anon.</p>

<p><center><i>[Rugby exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Farewell, my hearts. I will to my honest knight</p>

<p>Falstaff, and drink canary with him.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  I think I shall drink in pipe-wine first</p>

<p>with him; I’ll make him dance.–Will you go,</p>

<p>gentles?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc> <sc>Doctor</sc> <sc>Caius</sc> and <sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Have with you to</p>

<p>see this monster.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
