<p><center><i>[Enter Fenton and Anne Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc></p>

<p>I see I cannot get thy father’s love;</p>

<p>Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc></p>

<p>Alas, how then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc>  Why, thou must be thyself.</p>

<p>He doth object I am too great of birth,</p>

<p>And that, my state being galled with my expense,</p>

<p>I seek to heal it only by his wealth.</p>

<p>Besides these, other bars he lays before me–</p>

<p>My riots past, my wild societies–</p>

<p>And tells me ’tis a thing impossible</p>

<p>I should love thee but as a property.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc>  Maybe he tells you true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc></p>

<p>No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!</p>

<p>Albeit I will confess thy father’s wealth</p>

<p>Was the first motive that I wooed thee, Anne,</p>

<p>Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value</p>

<p>Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags.</p>

<p>And ’tis the very riches of thyself</p>

<p>That now I aim at.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc>  Gentle Master Fenton,</p>

<p>Yet seek my father’s love, still seek it, sir.</p>

<p>If opportunity and humblest suit</p>

<p>Cannot attain it, why then–hark you hither.</p>

<p><center><i>[They talk aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Shallow, Slender, and Mistress Quickly.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Break their talk, Mistress Quickly. My kinsman</p>

<p>shall speak for himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  I’ll make a shaft or a bolt on ’t. ’Slid, ’tis but</p>

<p>venturing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Be not dismayed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  No, she shall not dismay me. I care not for</p>

<p>that, but that I am afeard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc> <i>[to Anne]</i>  Hark ye, Master Slender</p>

<p>would speak a word with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc></p>

<p>I come to him. <i>[(Aside.)]</i> This is my father’s choice.</p>

<p>O, what a world of vile ill-favored faults</p>

<p>Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  And how does good Master Fenton?</p>

<p>Pray you, a word with you.     <i><i>[They talk aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc> <i>[to Slender]</i>  She’s coming. To her, coz! O</p>

<p>boy, thou hadst a father!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can</p>

<p>tell you good jests of him.–Pray you, uncle, tell</p>

<p>Mistress Anne the jest how my father stole two</p>

<p>geese out of a pen, good uncle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Ay, that I do, as well as I love any woman in</p>

<p>Gloucestershire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Ay, that I will, come cut and longtail, under</p>

<p>the degree of a squire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  He will make you a hundred and fifty</p>

<p>pounds jointure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc>  Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shallow</sc>  Marry, I thank you for it. I thank you for that</p>

<p>good comfort.–She calls you, coz. I’ll leave you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He steps aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc>  Now, Master Slender.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Now, good Mistress Anne.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc>  What is your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  My will? ’Od’s heartlings, that’s a pretty jest</p>

<p>indeed! I ne’er made my will yet, I thank heaven. I</p>

<p>am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc>  I mean, Master Slender, what would you with</p>

<p>me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Truly, for mine own part, I would little or</p>

<p>nothing with you. Your father and my uncle hath</p>

<p>made motions. If it be my luck, so; if not, happy</p>

<p>man be his dole. They can tell you how things go</p>

<p>better than I can. You may ask your father.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Page and Mistress Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here he comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>Now, Master Slender.–Love him, daughter Anne.–</p>

<p>Why, how now? What does Master Fenton here?</p>

<p>You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house.</p>

<p>I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc></p>

<p>Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  She is no match for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc>  Sir, will you hear me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  No, good Master Fenton.–</p>

<p>Come Master Shallow.–Come, son Slender, in.–</p>

<p>Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.</p>

<p><center><i>[Page, Shallow, and Slender exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc> <i>[to Fenton]</i>  Speak to Mistress Page.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc></p>

<p>Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter</p>

<p>In such a righteous fashion as I do,</p>

<p>Perforce, against all checks, rebukes, and manners,</p>

<p>I must advance the colors of my love</p>

<p>And not retire. Let me have your good will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc></p>

<p>Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  That’s my master, Master Doctor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc></p>

<p>Alas, I had rather be set quick i’ th’ earth</p>

<p>And bowled to death with turnips!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>Come, trouble not yourself.–Good Master Fenton,</p>

<p>I will not be your friend nor enemy.</p>

<p>My daughter will I question how she loves you,</p>

<p>And as I find her, so am I affected.</p>

<p>Till then, farewell, sir. She must needs go in;</p>

<p>Her father will be angry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, gentle mistress.–Farewell, Nan.</p>

<p><center><i>[Mistress Page and Anne Page exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  This is my doing now. “Nay,” said I,</p>

<p>“will you cast away your child on a fool and a</p>

<p>physician? Look on Master Fenton.” This is my</p>

<p>doing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc></p>

<p>I thank thee; and I pray thee, once tonight</p>

<p>Give my sweet Nan this ring. There’s for thy pains.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives her money and a ring.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  Now heaven send thee good fortune.</p>

<p><center><i>[Fenton exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>A kind heart he hath. A woman would run through</p>

<p>fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I</p>

<p>would my master had Mistress Anne, or I would</p>

<p>Master Slender had her, or, in sooth, I would Master</p>

<p>Fenton had her. I will do what I can for them all</p>

<p>three; for so I have promised and I’ll be as good as</p>

<p>my word–but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,</p>

<p>I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from</p>

<p>my two mistresses. What a beast am I to slack it!</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>
