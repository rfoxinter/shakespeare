<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff and Mistress Ford.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up</p>

<p>my sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your</p>

<p>love, and I profess requital to a hair’s breadth, not</p>

<p>only, Mistress Ford, in the simple office of love,</p>

<p>but in all the accoutrement, compliment, and ceremony</p>

<p>of it. But are you sure of your husband now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  He’s a-birding, sweet Sir John.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span> <i>[within]</i>  What ho, gossip Ford! What</p>

<p>ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Step into th’ chamber, Sir John.</p>

<p><center><i>[Falstaff exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  How now, sweetheart, who’s at home</p>

<p>besides yourself?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Why, none but mine own people.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Indeed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  No, certainly. <i>[Aside to her.]</i> Speak</p>

<p>louder.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Truly, I am so glad you have nobody</p>

<p>here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Why?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Why, woman, your husband is in his</p>

<p>old lunes again. He so takes on yonder with my</p>

<p>husband, so rails against all married mankind, so</p>

<p>curses all Eve’s daughters of what complexion soever,</p>

<p>and so buffets himself on the forehead, crying</p>

<p>“Peer out, peer out!” that any madness I ever yet</p>

<p>beheld seemed but tameness, civility, and patience</p>

<p>to this his distemper he is in now. I am glad the fat</p>

<p>knight is not here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Why, does he talk of him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Of none but him, and swears he was</p>

<p>carried out, the last time he searched for him, in a</p>

<p>basket; protests to my husband he is now here;</p>

<p>and hath drawn him and the rest of their company</p>

<p>from their sport to make another experiment of</p>

<p>his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is not here.</p>

<p>Now he shall see his own foolery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  How near is he, Mistress Page?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Hard by, at street end. He will be here</p>

<p>anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  I am undone! The knight is here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Why then, you are utterly shamed, and</p>

<p>he’s but a dead man. What a woman are you! Away</p>

<p>with him, away with him! Better shame than</p>

<p>murder.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Which way should he go? How should</p>

<p>I bestow him? Shall I put him into the basket</p>

<p>again?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  No, I’ll come no more i’ th’ basket. May I not</p>

<p>go out ere he come?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Alas, three of Master Ford’s brothers</p>

<p>watch the door with pistols, that none shall issue</p>

<p>out. Otherwise you might slip away ere he came.</p>

<p>But what make you here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  What shall I do? I’ll creep up into the</p>

<p>chimney.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  There they always use to discharge</p>

<p>their birding pieces.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Creep into the kiln-hole.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Where is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  He will seek there, on my word. Neither</p>

<p>press, coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he</p>

<p>hath an abstract for the remembrance of such</p>

<p>places, and goes to them by his note. There is no</p>

<p>hiding you in the house.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  I’ll go out, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  If you go out in your own semblance,</p>

<p>you die, Sir John–unless you go out disguised.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  How might we disguise him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Alas the day, I know not. There is no</p>

<p>woman’s gown big enough for him; otherwise he</p>

<p>might put on a hat, a muffler, and a kerchief, and</p>

<p>so escape.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Good hearts, devise something. Any extremity</p>

<p>rather than a mischief.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  My maid’s aunt, the fat woman of</p>

<p>Brentford, has a gown above.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  On my word, it will serve him. She’s as</p>

<p>big as he is. And there’s her thrummed hat and her</p>

<p>muffler too.–Run up, Sir John.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Go, go, sweet Sir John. Mistress Page</p>

<p>and I will look some linen for your head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Quick, quick! We’ll come dress you</p>

<p>straight. Put on the gown the while.</p>

<p><center><i>[Falstaff exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  I would my husband would meet him</p>

<p>in this shape. He cannot abide the old woman of</p>

<p>Brentford. He swears she’s a witch, forbade her my</p>

<p>house, and hath threatened to beat her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Heaven guide him to thy husband’s</p>

<p>cudgel, and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  But is my husband coming?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Ay, in good sadness is he, and talks of</p>

<p>the basket too, howsoever he hath had</p>

<p>intelligence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  We’ll try that; for I’ll appoint my men</p>

<p>to carry the basket again, to meet him at the door</p>

<p>with it as they did last time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Nay, but he’ll be here presently. Let’s go</p>

<p>dress him like the witch of Brentford.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  I’ll first direct my men what they shall</p>

<p>do with the basket. Go up. I’ll bring linen for him</p>

<p>straight.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Hang him, dishonest varlet! We cannot</p>

<p>misuse him enough.</p>

<p>We’ll leave a proof, by that which we will do,</p>

<p>Wives may be merry and yet honest too.</p>

<p>We do not act that often jest and laugh;</p>

<p>’Tis old but true: “Still swine eats all the draff.”</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Ford with Robert and John,</p>

<p>who bring the buck-basket.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Go, sirs, take the basket again on your</p>

<p>shoulders. Your master is hard at door. If he bid</p>

<p>you set it down, obey him. Quickly, dispatch.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Robert</span>  Come, come, take it up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>John</span>  Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Robert</span>  I hope not. I had lief as bear so much lead.</p>

<p><center><i>[They pick up the basket.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ford, Page, Doctor Caius, Sir Hugh</p>

<p>Evans, and Shallow.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you</p>

<p>any way then to unfool me again?–Set down the</p>

<p>basket, villain. <i>[They put the basket down.]</i> Somebody</p>

<p>call my wife. Youth in a basket! O, you panderly</p>

<p>rascals! There’s a knot, a gang, a pack, a</p>

<p>conspiracy against me. Now shall the devil be</p>

<p>shamed.–What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!</p>

<p>Behold what honest clothes you send forth to</p>

<p>bleaching!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  Why, this passes, Master Ford! You are not to go</p>

<p>loose any longer; you must be pinioned.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sir</span> <span class='sc'>Hugh</span>  Why, this is lunatics. This is mad as a mad</p>

<p>dog.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  So say I too, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Ford.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Come hither, Mistress Ford.–Mistress Ford, the</p>

<p>honest woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature,</p>

<p>that hath the jealous fool to her husband!–I</p>

<p>suspect without cause, mistress, do I?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Heaven be my witness you do, if you</p>

<p>suspect me in any dishonesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Well said, brazen-face. Hold it out.–Come</p>

<p>forth, sirrah.     <i><i>[He pulls clothes out of the basket.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  This passes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Are you not ashamed? Let the clothes</p>

<p>alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  I shall find you anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sir</span> <span class='sc'>Hugh</span>  ’Tis unreasonable. Will you take up your</p>

<p>wife’s clothes? Come, away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[to the Servants]</i>  Empty the basket, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Why, man, why?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed</p>

<p>out of my house yesterday in this basket.</p>

<p>Why may not he be there again? In my house I am</p>

<p>sure he is. My intelligence is true, my jealousy is</p>

<p>reasonable.–Pluck me out all the linen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  If you find a man there, he shall die a</p>

<p>flea’s death.     <i><i>[Robert and John empty the basket.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  Here’s no man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford.</p>

<p>This wrongs you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sir</span> <span class='sc'>Hugh</span>  Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow</p>

<p>the imaginations of your own heart. This is</p>

<p>jealousies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Well, he’s not here I seek for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Help to search my house this one time. If I find</p>

<p>not what I seek, show no color for my extremity.</p>

<p>Let me forever be your table-sport. Let them say of</p>

<p>me “As jealous as Ford, that searched a hollow</p>

<p>walnut for his wife’s leman.” Satisfy me once</p>

<p>more. Once more search with me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Robert and John refill the basket and carry it off.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[calling offstage]</i>  What ho, Mistress</p>

<p>Page! Come you and the old woman down. My</p>

<p>husband will come into the chamber.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  “Old woman”? What old woman’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Why, it is my maid’s aunt of Brentford.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have</p>

<p>I not forbid her my house? She comes of errands,</p>

<p>does she? We are simple men; we do not know</p>

<p>what’s brought to pass under the profession of</p>

<p>fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells, by</p>

<p>th’ figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond our</p>

<p>element. We know nothing.– Come down, you</p>

<p>witch, you hag, you! Come down, I say!</p>

<p><center><i>[Ford seizes a cudgel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Nay, good sweet husband!–Good gentlemen,</p>

<p>let him not strike the old woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Page and Sir John Falstaff disguised</p>

<p>as an old woman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Come, Mother Pratt; come, give me</p>

<p>your hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  I’ll pratt her. <i>[(He beats Falstaff.)]</i> Out of my</p>

<p>door, you witch, you rag, you baggage, you polecat,</p>

<p>you runnion! Out, out! I’ll conjure you, I’ll</p>

<p>fortune-tell you!     <i><i>[Falstaff exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Are you not ashamed? I think you have</p>

<p>killed the poor woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Nay, he will do it.–’Tis a goodly credit</p>

<p>for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Hang her, witch!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sir</span> <span class='sc'>Hugh</span>  By yea and no, I think the ’oman is a witch</p>

<p>indeed. I like not when a ’oman has a great peard.</p>

<p>I spy a great peard under her muffler.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow.</p>

<p>See but the issue of my jealousy. If I cry out</p>

<p>thus upon no trail, never trust me when I open</p>

<p>again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  Let’s obey his humor a little further. Come,</p>

<p>gentlemen.</p>

<p><center><i>[Ford, Page, Caius, Sir Hugh, and Shallow exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Nay, by th’ Mass, that he did not; he</p>

<p>beat him most unpitifully, methought.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  I’ll have the cudgel hallowed and hung</p>

<p>o’er the altar. It hath done meritorious service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  What think you? May we, with the</p>

<p>warrant of womanhood and the witness of a good</p>

<p>conscience, pursue him with any further revenge?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  The spirit of wantonness is, sure,</p>

<p>scared out of him. If the devil have him not in fee</p>

<p>simple, with fine and recovery, he will never, I</p>

<p>think, in the way of waste, attempt us again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  Shall we tell our husbands how we</p>

<p>have served him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Yes, by all means–if it be but to scrape</p>

<p>the figures out of your husband’s brains. If they</p>

<p>can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat</p>

<p>knight shall be any further afflicted, we two will</p>

<p>still be the ministers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Ford</span>  I’ll warrant they’ll have him publicly</p>

<p>shamed, and methinks there would be no period to</p>

<p>the jest should he not be publicly shamed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Page</span>  Come, to the forge with it, then shape</p>

<p>it. I would not have things cool.</p>
