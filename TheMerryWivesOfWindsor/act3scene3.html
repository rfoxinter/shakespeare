<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  What, John! What, Robert!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Quickly, quickly! Is the buck-basket–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  I warrant.–What, Robert, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter John and Robert with a large buck-basket.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Come, come, come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Here, set it down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Give your men the charge. We must be</p>

<p>brief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Marry, as I told you before, John and</p>

<p>Robert, be ready here hard by in the brewhouse,</p>

<p>and when I suddenly call you, come forth, and</p>

<p>without any pause or staggering take this basket</p>

<p>on your shoulders. That done, trudge with it in all</p>

<p>haste, and carry it among the whitsters in Datchet</p>

<p>Mead, and there empty it in the muddy ditch close</p>

<p>by the Thames side.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  You will do it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  I ha’ told them over and over. They lack</p>

<p>no direction.–Be gone, and come when you are</p>

<p>called.     <i><i>[John and Robert exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Here comes little Robin.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robin.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  How now, my eyas-musket? What news</p>

<p>with you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc>  My master, Sir John, is come in at your back</p>

<p>door, Mistress Ford, and requests your company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been</p>

<p>true to us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc>  Ay, I’ll be sworn. My master knows not of your</p>

<p>being here and hath threatened to put me into</p>

<p>everlasting liberty if I tell you of it, for he swears</p>

<p>he’ll turn me away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Thou ’rt a good boy. This secrecy of</p>

<p>thine shall be a tailor to thee and shall make thee a</p>

<p>new doublet and hose.–I’ll go hide me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Do so.–Go tell thy master I am alone.</p>

<p><i>[(Robin exits.)]</i> Mistress Page, remember you your</p>

<p>cue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  I warrant thee. If I do not act it, hiss</p>

<p>me.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Go to, then. We’ll use this unwholesome</p>

<p>humidity, this gross-wat’ry pumpion. We’ll</p>

<p>teach him to know turtles from jays.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  “Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel?”</p>

<p>Why, now let me die, for I have lived long enough.</p>

<p>This is the period of my ambition. O, this blessed</p>

<p>hour!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  O, sweet Sir John!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Mistress Ford, I cannot cog. I cannot prate,</p>

<p>Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would</p>

<p>thy husband were dead. I’ll speak it before the best</p>

<p>lord: I would make thee my lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  I your lady, Sir John? Alas, I should be</p>

<p>a pitiful lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Let the court of France show me such</p>

<p>another. I see how thine eye would emulate the</p>

<p>diamond. Thou hast the right arched beauty of the</p>

<p>brow that becomes the ship-tire, the tire-valiant,</p>

<p>or any tire of Venetian admittance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  A plain kerchief, Sir John. My brows</p>

<p>become nothing else, nor that well neither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Thou art a tyrant to say so. Thou wouldst</p>

<p>make an absolute courtier, and the firm fixture of</p>

<p>thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait</p>

<p>in a semicircled farthingale. I see what thou wert,</p>

<p>if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature thy friend.</p>

<p>Come, thou canst not hide it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Believe me, there’s no such thing in</p>

<p>me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What made me love thee? Let that persuade</p>

<p>thee. There’s something extraordinary in thee.</p>

<p>Come, I cannot cog and say thou art this and that</p>

<p>like a many of these lisping hawthorn buds that</p>

<p>come like women in men’s apparel and smell like</p>

<p>Bucklersbury in simple time. I cannot. But I love</p>

<p>thee, none but thee; and thou deserv’st it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love</p>

<p>Mistress Page.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by</p>

<p>the Counter gate, which is as hateful to me as the</p>

<p>reek of a lime-kiln.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Well, heaven knows how I love you,</p>

<p>and you shall one day find it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Keep in that mind. I’ll deserve it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Nay, I must tell you, so you do, or else</p>

<p>I could not be in that mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robin.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc>  Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! Here’s Mistress</p>

<p>Page at the door, sweating and blowing and looking</p>

<p>wildly, and would needs speak with you</p>

<p>presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  She shall not see me. I will ensconce me behind</p>

<p>the arras.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Pray you, do so. She’s a very tattling</p>

<p>woman.     <i><i>[Falstaff stands behind the arras.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What’s the matter? How now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  O Mistress Ford, what have you done?</p>

<p>You’re shamed, you’re overthrown, you’re undone</p>

<p>forever!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  What’s the matter, good Mistress Page?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  O well-a-day, Mistress Ford, having an</p>

<p>honest man to your husband, to give him such</p>

<p>cause of suspicion!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  What cause of suspicion?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  What cause of suspicion? Out upon you!</p>

<p>How am I mistook in you!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Why, alas, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Your husband’s coming hither, woman,</p>

<p>with all the officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman</p>

<p>that he says is here now in the house, by</p>

<p>your consent, to take an ill advantage of his absence.</p>

<p>You are undone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  ’Tis not so, I hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Pray heaven it be not so, that you have</p>

<p>such a man here! But ’tis most certain your husband’s</p>

<p>coming, with half Windsor at his heels, to</p>

<p>search for such a one. I come before to tell you. If</p>

<p>you know yourself clear, why, I am glad of it. But if</p>

<p>you have a friend here, convey, convey him out. Be</p>

<p>not amazed! Call all your senses to you; defend</p>

<p>your reputation, or bid farewell to your good life</p>

<p>forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  What shall I do? There is a gentleman,</p>

<p>my dear friend; and I fear not mine own shame so</p>

<p>much as his peril. I had rather than a thousand</p>

<p>pound he were out of the house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  For shame! Never stand “you had</p>

<p>rather” and “you had rather.” Your husband’s here</p>

<p>at hand. Bethink you of some conveyance. In the</p>

<p>house you cannot hide him. O, how have you deceived</p>

<p>me! Look, here is a basket. If he be of any</p>

<p>reasonable stature, he may creep in here; and</p>

<p>throw foul linen upon him, as if it were going to</p>

<p>bucking. Or–it is whiting time–send him by your</p>

<p>two men to Datchet Mead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  He’s too big to go in there. What shall I</p>

<p>do?     <i><i>[Falstaff comes forward.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Let me see ’t, let me see ’t! O, let me see ’t! I’ll</p>

<p>in, I’ll in. Follow your friend’s counsel. I’ll in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  What, Sir John Falstaff? <i>[(Aside to</p>

<p>him.)]</i> Are these your letters, knight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[aside to Mistress Page]</i>  I love thee. Help me</p>

<p>away. Let me creep in here. I’ll never–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Falstaff goes into the basket; they cover</p>

<p>him with dirty clothes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc> <i>[to Robin]</i>  Help to cover your master,</p>

<p>boy.–Call your men, Mistress Ford.–You dissembling</p>

<p>knight!     <i><i>[Robin exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  What, John! Robert! John!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robert and John.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Go, take up these clothes here quickly. Where’s the</p>

<p>cowlstaff? Look how you drumble! Carry them to</p>

<p>the laundress in Datchet Mead. Quickly! Come.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ford, Page, Doctor Caius,</p>

<p>and Sir Hugh Evans.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Pray you, come near. If I suspect without cause,</p>

<p>why then make sport at me. Then let me be your</p>

<p>jest; I deserve it.–How now? Whither bear you</p>

<p>this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robert</sc> and <sc>John</sc>  To the laundress, forsooth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Why, what have you to do whither they</p>

<p>bear it? You were best meddle with buck-washing!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Buck? I would I could wash myself of the buck.</p>

<p>Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck! I warrant you, buck,</p>

<p>and of the season too, it shall appear.</p>

<p><center><i>[Robert and John exit with the buck-basket.]</i></center></p>

<p>Gentlemen, I have dreamed tonight; I’ll tell you my</p>

<p>dream. Here, here, here be my keys. Ascend my</p>

<p>chambers. Search, seek, find out. I’ll warrant we’ll</p>

<p>unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first. <i>[(He</p>

<p>locks the door.)]</i> So, now uncape.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Good Master Ford, be contented. You wrong</p>

<p>yourself too much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  True, Master Page.–Up, gentlemen. You shall</p>

<p>see sport anon. Follow me, gentlemen.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  This is fery fantastical humors and</p>

<p>jealousies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc> <sc>Caius</sc>  By gar, ’tis no the fashion of France. It is</p>

<p>not jealous in France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Nay, follow him, gentlemen. See the issue of his</p>

<p>search.     <i><i>[Page, Sir Hugh, and Caius exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Is there not a double excellency in this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  I know not which pleases me better–</p>

<p>that my husband is deceived, or Sir John.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  What a taking was he in when your</p>

<p>husband asked who was in the basket!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  I am half afraid he will have need of</p>

<p>washing, so throwing him into the water will do</p>

<p>him a benefit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all</p>

<p>of the same strain were in the same distress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  I think my husband hath some special</p>

<p>suspicion of Falstaff’s being here, for I never saw</p>

<p>him so gross in his jealousy till now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  I will lay a plot to try that, and we will</p>

<p>yet have more tricks with Falstaff. His dissolute</p>

<p>disease will scarce obey this medicine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Shall we send that foolish carrion Mistress</p>

<p>Quickly to him, and excuse his throwing into</p>

<p>the water, and give him another hope, to betray</p>

<p>him to another punishment?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  We will do it. Let him be sent for tomorrow</p>

<p>eight o’clock to have amends.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ford, Page, Doctor Caius, and Sir Hugh.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  I cannot find him. Maybe the knave bragged of</p>

<p>that he could not compass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc> <i>[aside to Mistress Ford]</i>  Heard you</p>

<p>that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  You use me well, Master Ford, do you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Ay, I do so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Heaven make you better than your</p>

<p>thoughts!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Amen!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  You do yourself mighty wrong, Master</p>

<p>Ford.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Ay, ay. I must bear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  If there be anypody in the house, and in the</p>

<p>chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses,</p>

<p>heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc> <sc>Caius</sc>  Be gar, nor I too. There is nobodies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Fie, fie, Master Ford, are you not ashamed?</p>

<p>What spirit, what devil suggests this imagination?</p>

<p>I would not ha’ your distemper in this kind for the</p>

<p>wealth of Windsor Castle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  ’Tis my fault, Master Page. I suffer for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  You suffer for a pad conscience. Your wife is</p>

<p>as honest a ’omans as I will desires among five</p>

<p>thousand, and five hundred too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc> <sc>Caius</sc>  By gar, I see ’tis an honest woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come,</p>

<p>walk in the park. I pray you, pardon me. I will</p>

<p>hereafter make known to you why I have done</p>
