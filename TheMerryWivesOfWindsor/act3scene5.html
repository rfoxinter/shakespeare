<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Bardolph, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bardolph.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Here, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in ’t.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bardolph exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Have I lived to be carried in a basket like a barrow</p>

<p>of butcher’s offal, and to be thrown in the Thames?</p>

<p>Well, if I be served such another trick, I’ll have my</p>

<p>brains ta’en out and buttered, and give them to a</p>

<p>dog for a New Year’s gift. ’Sblood, the rogues</p>

<p>slighted me into the river with as little remorse as</p>

<p>they would have drowned a blind bitch’s puppies,</p>

<p>fifteen i’ th’ litter! And you may know by my size</p>

<p>that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the bottom</p>

<p>were as deep as hell, I should down. I had</p>

<p>been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and</p>

<p>shallow–a death that I abhor, for the water swells</p>

<p>a man, and what a thing should I have been when</p>

<p>I had been swelled! By the Lord, I should have</p>

<p>been a mountain of mummy.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bardolph with cups of sack.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Here’s Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Come, let me pour in some sack to the</p>

<p>Thames water, for my belly’s as cold as if I had</p>

<p>swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the reins. <i>[He</p>

<p>drinks.]</i> Call her in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Come in, woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Quickly.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  By your leave, I cry you mercy. Give</p>

<p>your Worship good morrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[to Bardolph]</i>  Take away these chalices. Go</p>

<p>brew me a pottle of sack finely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  With eggs, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Simple of itself. I’ll no pullet sperm in my</p>

<p>brewage.     <i><i>[Bardolph exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>How now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  Marry, sir, I come to your Worship</p>

<p>from Mistress Ford.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Mistress Ford? I have had ford enough. I</p>

<p>was thrown into the ford, I have my belly full of</p>

<p>ford.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  Alas the day, good heart, that was</p>

<p>not her fault. She does so take on with her men;</p>

<p>they mistook their erection.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  So did I mine, to build upon a foolish</p>

<p>woman’s promise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it</p>

<p>would yearn your heart to see it. Her husband goes</p>

<p>this morning a-birding; she desires you once more</p>

<p>to come to her, between eight and nine. I must</p>

<p>carry her word quickly. She’ll make you amends, I</p>

<p>warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Well, I will visit her. Tell her so. And bid her</p>

<p>think what a man is. Let her consider his frailty,</p>

<p>and then judge of my merit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  I will tell her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Do so. Between nine and ten, say’st thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  Eight and nine, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Well, be gone. I will not miss her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  Peace be with you, sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[Mistress Quickly exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I marvel I hear not of Master Brook. He</p>

<p>sent me word to stay within. I like his money well.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ford disguised as Brook.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O, here he comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[as Brook]</i>  God bless you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Now, Master Brook, you come to know</p>

<p>what hath passed between me and Ford’s wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[as Brook]</i>  That indeed, Sir John, is my</p>

<p>business.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Master Brook, I will not lie to you. I was at</p>

<p>her house the hour she appointed me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[as Brook]</i>  And sped you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[as Brook]</i>  How so, sir? Did she change her</p>

<p>determination?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  No, Master Brook, but the peaking cornuto</p>

<p>her husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual</p>

<p>’larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of</p>

<p>our encounter, after we had embraced, kissed,</p>

<p>protested, and, as it were, spoke the prologue of</p>

<p>our comedy, and, at his heels, a rabble of his companions,</p>

<p>thither provoked and instigated by his</p>

<p>distemper, and, forsooth, to search his house for</p>

<p>his wife’s love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[as Brook]</i>  What, while you were there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  While I was there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[as Brook]</i>  And did he search for you and could</p>

<p>not find you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  You shall hear. As good luck would have it,</p>

<p>comes in one Mistress Page, gives intelligence of</p>

<p>Ford’s approach, and, in her invention and Ford’s</p>

<p>wife’s distraction, they conveyed me into a</p>

<p>buck-basket.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[as Brook]</i>  A buck-basket!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  By the Lord, a buck-basket! Rammed me</p>

<p>in with foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings,</p>

<p>greasy napkins, that, Master Brook, there</p>

<p>was the rankest compound of villainous smell that</p>

<p>ever offended nostril.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[as Brook]</i>  And how long lay you there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I</p>

<p>have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your</p>

<p>good. Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple</p>

<p>of Ford’s knaves, his hinds, were called forth by</p>

<p>their mistress to carry me in the name of foul</p>

<p>clothes to Datchet Lane. They took me on their</p>

<p>shoulders, met the jealous knave their master in</p>

<p>the door, who asked them once or twice what they</p>

<p>had in their basket. I quaked for fear lest the lunatic</p>

<p>knave would have searched it, but fate, ordaining</p>

<p>he should be a cuckold, held his hand.</p>

<p>Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for</p>

<p>foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook.</p>

<p>I suffered the pangs of three several deaths: first,</p>

<p>an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous</p>

<p>rotten bellwether; next, to be compassed, like a</p>

<p>good bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to</p>

<p>point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in, like</p>

<p>a strong distillation, with stinking clothes that fretted</p>

<p>in their own grease. Think of that, a man of my</p>

<p>kidney–think of that–that am as subject to heat</p>

<p>as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw.</p>

<p>It was a miracle to ’scape suffocation. And in</p>

<p>the height of this bath, when I was more than half-stewed</p>

<p>in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be thrown</p>

<p>into the Thames and cooled, glowing hot, in that</p>

<p>surge, like a horseshoe! Think of that–hissing</p>

<p>hot–think of that, Master Brook.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[as Brook]</i>  In good sadness, sir, I am sorry that</p>

<p>for my sake you have suffered all this. My suit,</p>

<p>then, is desperate. You’ll undertake her no more?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna,</p>

<p>as I have been into Thames, ere I will leave her</p>

<p>thus. Her husband is this morning gone a-birding.</p>

<p>I have received from her another embassy of meeting.</p>

<p>’Twixt eight and nine is the hour, Master</p>

<p>Brook.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[as Brook]</i>  ’Tis past eight already, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.</p>

<p>Come to me at your convenient leisure,</p>

<p>and you shall know how I speed; and the conclusion</p>

<p>shall be crowned with your enjoying her.</p>

<p>Adieu. You shall have her, Master Brook. Master</p>

<p>Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.     <i><i>[Falstaff exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Hum! Ha! Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I</p>

<p>sleep? Master Ford, awake! Awake, Master Ford!</p>

<p>There’s a hole made in your best coat, Master</p>

<p>Ford. This ’tis to be married; this ’tis to have linen</p>

<p>and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself</p>

<p>what I am. I will now take the lecher. He is at my</p>

<p>house. He cannot ’scape me. ’Tis impossible he</p>

<p>should. He cannot creep into a half-penny purse,</p>

<p>nor into a pepper-box. But lest the devil that</p>

<p>guides him should aid him, I will search impossible</p>

<p>places. Though what I am I cannot avoid, yet to</p>

<p>be what I would not shall not make me tame. If I</p>

<p>have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go</p>

<p>with me: I’ll be horn-mad.</p>
