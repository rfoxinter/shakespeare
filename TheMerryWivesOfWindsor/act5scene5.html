<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff wearing a buck’s head.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  The Windsor bell hath struck twelve. The</p>

<p>minute draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist</p>

<p>me! Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy</p>

<p>Europa; love set on thy horns. O powerful love,</p>

<p>that in some respects makes a beast a man, in</p>

<p>some other a man a beast! You were also, Jupiter,</p>

<p>a swan for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love,</p>

<p>how near the god drew to the complexion of a</p>

<p>goose! A fault done first in the form of a beast; O</p>

<p>Jove, a beastly fault! And then another fault in the</p>

<p>semblance of a fowl; think on ’t, Jove, a foul fault.</p>

<p>When gods have hot backs, what shall poor men</p>

<p>do? For me, I am here a Windsor stag, and the fattest,</p>

<p>I think, i’ th’ forest. Send me a cool rut-time,</p>

<p>Jove, or who can blame me to piss my tallow?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Page and Mistress Ford.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Who comes here? My doe?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Sir John? Art thou there, my deer, my</p>

<p>male deer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain</p>

<p>potatoes, let it thunder to the tune of “Greensleeves,”</p>

<p>hail kissing-comfits, and snow eryngoes; let there</p>

<p>come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me</p>

<p>here.     <i><i>[He embraces her.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Mistress Page is come with me,</p>

<p>sweetheart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Divide me like a bribed buck, each a haunch.</p>

<p>I will keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for</p>

<p>the fellow of this walk, and my horns I bequeath</p>

<p>your husbands. Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like</p>

<p>Herne the Hunter? Why, now is Cupid a child of</p>

<p>conscience; he makes restitution. As I am a true</p>

<p>spirit, welcome.     <i><i>[A noise of horns within.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Alas, what noise?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Heaven forgive our sins!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What should this be?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc> and <sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Away, away.</p>

<p><center><i>[The two women run off.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I think the devil will not have me damned,</p>

<p>lest the oil that’s in me should set hell on fire. He</p>

<p>would never else cross me thus.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Quickly, Pistol, Sir Hugh Evans,</p>

<p>Anne Page and boys, all disguised as Fairies and</p>

<p>carrying tapers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc> <i>[as Fairy Queen]</i></p>

<p>Fairies black, gray, green, and white,</p>

<p>You moonshine revelers and shades of night,</p>

<p>You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,</p>

<p>Attend your office and your quality.</p>

<p>Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc> <i>[as Hobgoblin]</i></p>

<p>Elves, list your names. Silence, you airy toys!–</p>

<p>Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap,</p>

<p>Where fires thou find’st unraked and hearths</p>

<p>unswept.</p>

<p>There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry.</p>

<p>Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>They are fairies. He that speaks to them shall die.</p>

<p>I’ll wink and couch. No man their works must eye.</p>

<p><center><i>[He crouches down and covers his eyes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc> <i>[as a fairy]</i></p>

<p>Where’s Bead? Go you, and where you find a maid</p>

<p>That ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said,</p>

<p>Raise up the organs of her fantasy;</p>

<p>Sleep she as sound as careless infancy.</p>

<p>But those as sleep and think not on their sins,</p>

<p>Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides, and</p>

<p>shins.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc> <i>[as Fairy Queen]</i>  About, about!</p>

<p>Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out.</p>

<p>Strew good luck, aufs, on every sacred room,</p>

<p>That it may stand till the perpetual doom</p>

<p>In state as wholesome as in state ’tis fit,</p>

<p>Worthy the owner, and the owner it.</p>

<p>The several chairs of order look you scour</p>

<p>With juice of balm and every precious flower.</p>

<p>Each fair installment, coat, and sev’ral crest</p>

<p>With loyal blazon evermore be blest!</p>

<p>And nightly, meadow fairies, look you sing,</p>

<p>Like to the Garter’s compass, in a ring.</p>

<p>Th’ expressure that it bears, green let it be,</p>

<p>More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;</p>

<p>And Honi soit qui mal y pense write</p>

<p>In em’rald tufts, flowers purple, blue, and white,</p>

<p>Like sapphire, pearl, and rich embroidery,</p>

<p>Buckled below fair knighthood’s bending knee.</p>

<p>Fairies use flowers for their charactery.</p>

<p>Away, disperse! But till ’tis one o’clock,</p>

<p>Our dance of custom round about the oak</p>

<p>Of Herne the Hunter let us not forget.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc> <i>[as a fairy]</i></p>

<p>Pray you, lock hand in hand. Yourselves in order set;</p>

<p>And twenty glowworms shall our lanterns be,</p>

<p>To guide our measure round about the tree.</p>

<p>But stay! I smell a man of Middle Earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Heavens defend me from that Welsh</p>

<p>fairy, lest he transform me to a piece of cheese.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc> <i>[as Hobgoblin, to Falstaff]</i></p>

<p>Vile worm, thou wast o’erlooked even in thy birth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc> <i>[as Fairy Queen, to Sir Hugh]</i></p>

<p>With trial-fire touch me his finger-end.</p>

<p>If he be chaste, the flame will back descend</p>

<p>And turn him to no pain. But if he start,</p>

<p>It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc> <i>[as Hobgoblin]</i></p>

<p>A trial, come!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc> <i>[as a fairy]</i>  Come, will this wood take fire?</p>

<p><center><i>[Sir Hugh puts a taper to Falstaff’s finger, and he starts.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  O, O, O!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc> <i>[as Fairy Queen]</i></p>

<p>Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!</p>

<p>About him, fairies. Sing a scornful rhyme,</p>

<p>And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Here they pinch him and sing about him, and Doctor</p>

<p>Caius comes one way and steals away a boy in white.</p>

<p>And Slender comes another way; he takes a boy in</p>

<p>green. And Fenton steals Mistress Anne Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fairies</sc> <i>[sing]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fie on sinful fantasy!</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fie on lust and luxury!</i></p>

<p>     <i>Lust is but a bloody fire</i></p>

<p>     <i>Kindled with unchaste desire,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fed in heart whose flames aspire</i></p>

<p>     <i>As thoughts do blow them higher and higher.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Pinch him, fairies, mutually;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Pinch him for his villainy.</i></p>

<p>Pinch him and burn him and turn him about,</p>

<p>Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[A noise of hunting is made within, and all the fairies</p>

<p>run away from Falstaff, who pulls off his buck’s head</p>

<p>and rises up. Enter Page, Mistress Page,</p>

<p>Mistress Ford and Ford.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc> <i>[to Falstaff]</i></p>

<p>Nay, do not fly. I think we have watched you now.</p>

<p>Will none but Herne the Hunter serve your turn?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher.–</p>

<p>Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?</p>

<p><center><i>[She points to the horns.]</i></center></p>

<p>See you these, husband? Do not these fair yokes</p>

<p>Become the forest better than the town?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[to Falstaff]</i>  Now, sir, who’s a cuckold now?</p>

<p>Master Brook, Falstaff’s a knave, a cuckoldly</p>

<p>knave. Here are his horns, Master Brook. And,</p>

<p>Master Brook, he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford’s</p>

<p>but his buck-basket, his cudgel, and twenty</p>

<p>pounds of money, which must be paid to Master</p>

<p>Brook. His horses are arrested for it, Master</p>

<p>Brook.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Sir John, we have had ill luck. We</p>

<p>could never meet. I will never take you for my love</p>

<p>again, but I will always count you my deer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Ay, and an ox too. Both the proofs are extant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  And these are not fairies. I was three or four</p>

<p>times in the thought they were not fairies; and yet</p>

<p>the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of</p>

<p>my powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into</p>

<p>a received belief, in despite of the teeth of all</p>

<p>rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now</p>

<p>how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent when ’tis upon</p>

<p>ill employment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Sir John Falstaff, serve Got and leave your</p>

<p>desires, and fairies will not pinse you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Well said, Fairy Hugh.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  And leave you your jealousies too, I pray</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art</p>

<p>able to woo her in good English.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it,</p>

<p>that it wants matter to prevent so gross o’erreaching</p>

<p>as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too?</p>

<p>Shall I have a coxcomb of frieze? ’Tis time I were</p>

<p>choked with a piece of toasted cheese.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Seese is not good to give putter. Your belly is</p>

<p>all putter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  “Seese” and “putter”? Have I lived to stand at</p>

<p>the taunt of one that makes fritters of English?</p>

<p>This is enough to be the decay of lust and late</p>

<p>walking through the realm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Why, Sir John, do you think though we</p>

<p>would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the</p>

<p>head and shoulders, and have given ourselves</p>

<p>without scruple to hell, that ever the devil could</p>

<p>have made you our delight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  What, a hodge-pudding? A bag of flax?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  A puffed man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Old, cold, withered, and of intolerable entrails?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  And one that is as slanderous as Satan?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  And as poor as Job?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  And as wicked as his wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  And given to fornications, and to taverns,</p>

<p>and sack, and wine, and metheglins, and to drinkings</p>

<p>and swearings and starings, pribbles and</p>

<p>prabbles?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Well, I am your theme. You have the start of</p>

<p>me. I am dejected. I am not able to answer the</p>

<p>Welsh flannel. Ignorance itself is a plummet o’er</p>

<p>me. Use me as you will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Marry, sir, we’ll bring you to Windsor to one</p>

<p>Master Brook, that you have cozened of money,</p>

<p>to whom you should have been a pander. Over and</p>

<p>above that you have suffered, I think to repay that</p>

<p>money will be a biting affliction.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Yet be cheerful, knight. Thou shalt eat a posset</p>

<p>tonight at my house, where I will desire thee to</p>

<p>laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her</p>

<p>Master Slender hath married her daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Doctors doubt that. If Anne</p>

<p>Page be my daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius’</p>

<p>wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Slender.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  Whoa, ho, ho, Father Page!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Son, how now! How now, son! Have you</p>

<p>dispatched?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  “Dispatched”? I’ll make the best in Gloucestershire</p>

<p>know on ’t. Would I were hanged, la, else!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Of what, son?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress</p>

<p>Anne Page, and she’s a great lubberly boy. If it had</p>

<p>not been i’ th’ church, I would have swinged him,</p>

<p>or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it</p>

<p>had been Anne Page, would I might never stir! And</p>

<p>’tis a post-master’s boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Upon my life, then, you took the wrong–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  What need you tell me that? I think so, when</p>

<p>I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him,</p>

<p>for all he was in woman’s apparel, I would not</p>

<p>have had him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you</p>

<p>how you should know my daughter by her</p>

<p>garments?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Slender</sc>  I went to her in white, and cried “mum,”</p>

<p>and she cried “budget,” as Anne and I had appointed,</p>

<p>and yet it was not Anne, but a post-master’s</p>

<p>boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Good George, be not angry. I knew of</p>

<p>your purpose, turned my daughter into green,</p>

<p>and indeed she is now with the doctor at the deanery,</p>

<p>and there married.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Doctor Caius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc> <sc>Caius</sc>  Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened!</p>

<p>I ha’ married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by</p>

<p>gar, a boy. It is not Anne Page. By gar, I am</p>

<p>cozened.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Why? Did you take her in green?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc> <sc>Caius</sc>  Ay, be gar, and ’tis a boy. Be gar, I’ll raise</p>

<p>all Windsor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fenton and Anne Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  My heart misgives me. Here comes Master Fenton.–</p>

<p>How now, Master Fenton!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc>  Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Now, mistress, how chance you went not with</p>

<p>Master Slender?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc></p>

<p>You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it.</p>

<p>You would have married her most shamefully,</p>

<p>Where there was no proportion held in love.</p>

<p>The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,</p>

<p>Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.</p>

<p>Th’ offense is holy that she hath committed,</p>

<p>And this deceit loses the name of craft,</p>

<p>Of disobedience, or unduteous title,</p>

<p>Since therein she doth evitate and shun</p>

<p>A thousand irreligious cursed hours</p>

<p>Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc> <i>[to Page and Mistress Page]</i></p>

<p>Stand not amazed. Here is no remedy.</p>

<p>In love the heavens themselves do guide the state.</p>

<p>Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I am glad, though you have ta’en a special</p>

<p>stand to strike at me, that your arrow hath</p>

<p>glanced.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy.</p>

<p>What cannot be eschewed must be embraced.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc></p>

<p>When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>Well, I will muse no further.–Master Fenton,</p>

<p>Heaven give you many, many merry days.–</p>

<p>Good husband, let us every one go home</p>

<p>And laugh this sport o’er by a country fire–</p>

<p>Sir John and all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  Let it be so, Sir John.</p>

<p>To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word,</p>

<p>For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.</p>
