<p><center><i>[Enter Page, Ford, Mistress Page, Mistress Ford, and</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Evans.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  ’Tis one of the best discretions of a ’oman as</p>

<p>ever I did look upon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  And did he send you both these letters at an</p>

<p>instant?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Within a quarter of an hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc></p>

<p>Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt.</p>

<p>I rather will suspect the sun with cold</p>

<p>Than thee with wantonness. Now doth thy honor</p>

<p>stand,</p>

<p>In him that was of late an heretic,</p>

<p>As firm as faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  ’Tis well, ’tis well. No more.</p>

<p>Be not as extreme in submission as in offense.</p>

<p>But let our plot go forward. Let our wives</p>

<p>Yet once again, to make us public sport,</p>

<p>Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,</p>

<p>Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc></p>

<p>There is no better way than that they spoke of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  How, to send him word they’ll meet him in the</p>

<p>park at midnight? Fie, fie, he’ll never come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  You say he has been thrown in the rivers</p>

<p>and has been grievously peaten as an old ’oman.</p>

<p>Methinks there should be terrors in him, that he</p>

<p>should not come. Methinks his flesh is punished;</p>

<p>he shall have no desires.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  So think I too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc></p>

<p>Devise but how you’ll use him when he comes,</p>

<p>And let us two devise to bring him thither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>There is an old tale goes that Herne the Hunter,</p>

<p>Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest,</p>

<p>Doth all the wintertime, at still midnight,</p>

<p>Walk round about an oak, with great ragged horns,</p>

<p>And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,</p>

<p>And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a</p>

<p>chain</p>

<p>In a most hideous and dreadful manner.</p>

<p>You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know</p>

<p>The superstitious idle-headed eld</p>

<p>Received and did deliver to our age</p>

<p>This tale of Herne the Hunter for a truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>Why, yet there want not many that do fear</p>

<p>In deep of night to walk by this Herne’s oak.</p>

<p>But what of this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Ford</sc>  Marry, this is our device,</p>

<p>That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>Well, let it not be doubted but he’ll come.</p>

<p>And in this shape when you have brought him</p>

<p>thither,</p>

<p>What shall be done with him? What is your plot?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:</p>

<p>Nan Page my daughter, and my little son,</p>

<p>And three or four more of their growth we’ll dress</p>

<p>Like urchins, aufs, and fairies, green and white,</p>

<p>With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads</p>

<p>And rattles in their hands. Upon a sudden,</p>

<p>As Falstaff, she, and I are newly met,</p>

<p>Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once</p>

<p>With some diffused song. Upon their sight,</p>

<p>We two in great amazedness will fly.</p>

<p>Then let them all encircle him about,</p>

<p>And, fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight,</p>

<p>And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,</p>

<p>In their so sacred paths he dares to tread</p>

<p>In shape profane.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  And till he tell the truth,</p>

<p>Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound</p>

<p>And burn him with their tapers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  The truth being known,</p>

<p>We’ll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,</p>

<p>And mock him home to Windsor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  The children must</p>

<p>Be practiced well to this, or they’ll ne’er do ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  I will teach the children their behaviors, and</p>

<p>I will be like a jackanapes also, to burn the knight</p>

<p>with my taber.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc>  That will be excellent. I’ll go buy them vizards.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,</p>

<p>Finely attired in a robe of white.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>That silk will I go buy. <i>[(Aside.)]</i> And in that time</p>

<p>Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away</p>

<p>And marry her at Eton.–Go, send to Falstaff</p>

<p>straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ford</sc></p>

<p>Nay, I’ll to him again in name of Brook.</p>

<p>He’ll tell me all his purpose. Sure he’ll come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>Fear not you that. Go get us properties</p>

<p>And tricking for our fairies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Let us about it. It is admirable pleasures and</p>

<p>fery honest knaveries.</p>

<p><center><i>[Page, Ford, and Sir Hugh exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Page</sc>  Go, Mistress Ford,</p>

<p>Send quickly to Sir John to know his mind.</p>

<p><center><i>[Mistress Ford exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>I’ll to the doctor. He hath my good will,</p>

<p>And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.</p>

<p>That Slender, though well-landed, is an idiot,</p>

<p>And he my husband best of all affects.</p>

<p>The doctor is well-moneyed, and his friends</p>

<p>Potent at court. He, none but he, shall have her,</p>

<p>Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>
