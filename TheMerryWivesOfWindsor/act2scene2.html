<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff and Pistol.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  I will not lend thee a penny.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Why then, the world’s mine oyster, which I</p>

<p>with sword will open.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you</p>

<p>should lay my countenance to pawn. I have grated</p>

<p>upon my good friends for three reprieves for you</p>

<p>and your coach-fellow Nym, or else you had</p>

<p>looked through the grate like a gemini of baboons.</p>

<p>I am damned in hell for swearing to gentlemen my</p>

<p>friends you were good soldiers and tall fellows.</p>

<p>And when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her</p>

<p>fan, I took ’t upon mine honor thou hadst it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Didst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifteen</p>

<p>pence?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Reason, you rogue, reason. Think’st thou I’ll</p>

<p>endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more</p>

<p>about me. I am no gibbet for you. Go–a short</p>

<p>knife and a throng–to your manor of Pickt-hatch,</p>

<p>go. You’ll not bear a letter for me, you rogue? You</p>

<p>stand upon your honor? Why, thou unconfinable</p>

<p>baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the</p>

<p>terms of my honor precise. Ay, ay, I myself sometimes,</p>

<p>leaving the fear of God on the left hand</p>

<p>and hiding mine honor in my necessity, am fain to</p>

<p>shuffle, to hedge, and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,</p>

<p>will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain</p>

<p>looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your bold beating</p>

<p>oaths under the shelter of your honor! You will</p>

<p>not do it? You?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  I do relent. What would thou more of man?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robin.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Robin</span>  Sir, here’s a woman would speak with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Let her approach.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Quickly.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Give your Worship good morrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Good morrow, goodwife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Not so, an ’t please your Worship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Good maid, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  I’ll be sworn–as my mother was,</p>

<p>the first hour I was born.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  I do believe the swearer. What with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Shall I vouchsafe your Worship a</p>

<p>word or two?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Two thousand, fair woman, and I’ll vouchsafe</p>

<p>thee the hearing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  There is one Mistress Ford, sir–I</p>

<p>pray, come a little nearer this ways. I myself dwell</p>

<p>with Master Doctor Caius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Well, on. “Mistress Ford,” you say–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Your Worship says very true. I pray</p>

<p>your Worship, come a little nearer this ways.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  I warrant thee, nobody hears. Mine own</p>

<p>people, mine own people.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Are they so? God bless them and</p>

<p>make them His servants!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Well, “Mistress Ford”–what of her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Why, sir, she’s a good creature.</p>

<p>Lord, Lord, your Worship’s a wanton! Well, heaven</p>

<p>forgive you and all of us, I pray!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  “Mistress Ford”–come, “Mistress Ford”–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Marry, this is the short and the long</p>

<p>of it: you have brought her into such a canaries as</p>

<p>’tis wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when</p>

<p>the court lay at Windsor, could never have brought</p>

<p>her to such a canary. Yet there has been knights,</p>

<p>and lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I</p>

<p>warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter,</p>

<p>gift after gift, smelling so sweetly–all musk–and</p>

<p>so rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold, and in</p>

<p>such alligant terms, and in such wine and sugar of</p>

<p>the best and the fairest, that would have won any</p>

<p>woman’s heart; and, I warrant you, they could</p>

<p>never get an eye-wink of her. I had myself twenty</p>

<p>angels given me this morning, but I defy all angels</p>

<p>in any such sort, as they say, but in the way of</p>

<p>honesty. And, I warrant you, they could never get</p>

<p>her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of</p>

<p>them all. And yet there has been earls–nay, which</p>

<p>is more, pensioners–but, I warrant you, all is one</p>

<p>with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  But what says she to me? Be brief, my good</p>

<p>she-Mercury.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Marry, she hath received your letter,</p>

<p>for the which she thanks you a thousand times,</p>

<p>and she gives you to notify that her husband will</p>

<p>be absence from his house between ten and eleven.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Ten and eleven?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Ay, forsooth; and then you may come</p>

<p>and see the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master</p>

<p>Ford, her husband, will be from home. Alas, the</p>

<p>sweet woman leads an ill life with him. He’s a very</p>

<p>jealousy man. She leads a very frampold life with</p>

<p>him, good heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to</p>

<p>her. I will not fail her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Why, you say well. But I have another</p>

<p>messenger to your Worship. Mistress Page</p>

<p>hath her hearty commendations to you too; and,</p>

<p>let me tell you in your ear, she’s as fartuous a civil</p>

<p>modest wife, and one, I tell you, that will not miss</p>

<p>you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in Windsor,</p>

<p>whoe’er be the other. And she bade me tell</p>

<p>your Worship that her husband is seldom from</p>

<p>home, but she hopes there will come a time. I</p>

<p>never knew a woman so dote upon a man. Surely, I</p>

<p>think you have charms, la! Yes, in truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Not I, I assure thee. Setting the attraction of</p>

<p>my good parts aside, I have no other charms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Blessing on your heart for ’t!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  But I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford’s wife</p>

<p>and Page’s wife acquainted each other how they</p>

<p>love me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  That were a jest indeed! They have</p>

<p>not so little grace, I hope. That were a trick indeed!</p>

<p>But Mistress Page would desire you to send her</p>

<p>your little page, of all loves. Her husband has a</p>

<p>marvelous infection to the little page; and, truly,</p>

<p>Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in</p>

<p>Windsor leads a better life than she does. Do what</p>

<p>she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to</p>

<p>bed when she list, rise when she list–all is as she</p>

<p>will. And, truly, she deserves it, for if there be a</p>

<p>kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send</p>

<p>her your page, no remedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Why, I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mistress</span> <span class='sc'>Quickly</span>  Nay, but do so then, and, look you,</p>

<p>he may come and go between you both. And in any</p>

<p>case have a nayword, that you may know one another’s</p>

<p>mind, and the boy never need to understand</p>

<p>anything; for ’tis not good that children</p>

<p>should know any wickedness. Old folks, you know,</p>

<p>have discretion, as they say, and know the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Fare thee well. Commend me to them both.</p>

<p>There’s my purse. <i>[(He gives her money.)]</i> I am yet</p>

<p>thy debtor.–Boy, go along with this woman. <i>[(Mistress</p>

<p>Quickly and Robin exit.)]</i> This news distracts</p>

<p>me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>This punk is one of Cupid’s carriers.</p>

<p>Clap on more sails, pursue; up with your fights;</p>

<p>Give fire! She is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Sayst thou so, old Jack? Go thy ways. I’ll</p>

<p>make more of thy old body than I have done. Will</p>

<p>they yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense</p>

<p>of so much money, be now a gainer? Good</p>

<p>body, I thank thee. Let them say ’tis grossly done;</p>

<p>so it be fairly done, no matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bardolph with wine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Sir John, there’s one Master Brook below</p>

<p>would fain speak with you and be acquainted with</p>

<p>you, and hath sent your Worship a morning’s</p>

<p>draught of sack.     <i><i>[(He hands Falstaff the wine.)]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Brook is his name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Ay, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Call him in. Such Brooks are welcome to</p>

<p>me that o’erflows such liquor.     <i><i>[(Bardolph exits.)]</i></i></p>

<p>Ah ha, Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, have I encompassed</p>

<p>you? Go to. Via!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bardolph with Ford disguised as Brook.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  God bless you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  And you, sir. Would you speak with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  I make bold to press with so little</p>

<p>preparation upon you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  You’re welcome. What’s your will?–Give us</p>

<p>leave, drawer.     <i><i>[Bardolph exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent</p>

<p>much. My name is Brook.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance</p>

<p>of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  Good Sir John, I sue for yours–not</p>

<p>to charge you, for I must let you understand I</p>

<p>think myself in better plight for a lender than you</p>

<p>are, the which hath something emboldened me to</p>

<p>this unseasoned intrusion; for they say, if money</p>

<p>go before, all ways do lie open.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  Troth, and I have a bag of money</p>

<p>here troubles me. <i>[He sets it down.]</i> If you will help</p>

<p>to bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing me</p>

<p>of the carriage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your</p>

<p>porter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  I will tell you, sir, if you will give me</p>

<p>the hearing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Speak, good Master Brook. I shall be glad</p>

<p>to be your servant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  Sir, I hear you are a scholar–I will</p>

<p>be brief with you–and you have been a man long</p>

<p>known to me, though I had never so good means</p>

<p>as desire to make myself acquainted with you. I</p>

<p>shall discover a thing to you wherein I must very</p>

<p>much lay open mine own imperfection. But, good</p>

<p>Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as</p>

<p>you hear them unfolded, turn another into the register</p>

<p>of your own, that I may pass with a reproof</p>

<p>the easier, sith you yourself know how easy it is to</p>

<p>be such an offender.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Very well, sir. Proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  There is a gentlewoman in this</p>

<p>town–her husband’s name is Ford.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Well, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  I have long loved her and, I protest</p>

<p>to you, bestowed much on her, followed her with</p>

<p>a doting observance, engrossed opportunities to</p>

<p>meet her, fee’d every slight occasion that could but</p>

<p>niggardly give me sight of her, not only bought</p>

<p>many presents to give her, but have given largely to</p>

<p>many to know what she would have given. Briefly,</p>

<p>I have pursued her as love hath pursued me, which</p>

<p>hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever</p>

<p>I have merited, either in my mind or in my</p>

<p>means, meed I am sure I have received none, unless</p>

<p>experience be a jewel. That I have purchased</p>

<p>at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say</p>

<p>this:</p>

<p>“Love like a shadow flies when substance love</p>

<p>pursues,</p>

<p>Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Have you received no promise of satisfaction</p>

<p>at her hands?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  Never.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Have you importuned her to such a</p>

<p>purpose?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  Never.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Of what quality was your love, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  Like a fair house built on another</p>

<p>man’s ground, so that I have lost my edifice by</p>

<p>mistaking the place where I erected it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  To what purpose have you unfolded this to</p>

<p>me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  When I have told you that, I have</p>

<p>told you all. Some say that though she appear honest</p>

<p>to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her</p>

<p>mirth so far that there is shrewd construction</p>

<p>made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my</p>

<p>purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding,</p>

<p>admirable discourse, of great admittance,</p>

<p>authentic in your place and person, generally</p>

<p>allowed for your many warlike, courtlike, and</p>

<p>learned preparations.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  O, sir!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  Believe it, for you know it. There is</p>

<p>money. <i>[(He points to the bag.)]</i> Spend it, spend</p>

<p>it, spend more; spend all I have. Only give me so</p>

<p>much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an</p>

<p>amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford’s wife.</p>

<p>Use your art of wooing; win her to consent to you.</p>

<p>If any man may, you may as soon as any.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Would it apply well to the vehemency of</p>

<p>your affection that I should win what you would</p>

<p>enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very</p>

<p>preposterously.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  O, understand my drift. She dwells</p>

<p>so securely on the excellency of her honor that the</p>

<p>folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too</p>

<p>bright to be looked against. Now, could I come to</p>

<p>her with any detection in my hand, my desires had</p>

<p>instance and argument to commend themselves. I</p>

<p>could drive her then from the ward of her purity,</p>

<p>her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand</p>

<p>other her defenses, which now are too too strongly</p>

<p>embattled against me. What say you to ’t, Sir</p>

<p>John?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span> <i>[taking the bag]</i>  Master Brook, I will first</p>

<p>make bold with your money; next, give me your</p>

<p>hand; and, last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if</p>

<p>you will, enjoy Ford’s wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  O, good sir!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  I say you shall.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  Want no money, Sir John; you shall</p>

<p>want none.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you</p>

<p>shall want none. I shall be with her, I may tell you,</p>

<p>by her own appointment. Even as you came in to</p>

<p>me, her assistant or go-between parted from me. I</p>

<p>say I shall be with her between ten and eleven, for</p>

<p>at that time the jealous, rascally knave her husband</p>

<p>will be forth. Come you to me at night. You</p>

<p>shall know how I speed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  I am blessed in your acquaintance.</p>

<p>Do you know Ford, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know</p>

<p>him not. Yet I wrong him to call him poor. They</p>

<p>say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of</p>

<p>money, for the which his wife seems to me well-favored.</p>

<p>I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly</p>

<p>rogue’s coffer, and there’s my harvest home.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span> <i>[as Brook]</i>  I would you knew Ford, sir, that you</p>

<p>might avoid him if you saw him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I</p>

<p>will stare him out of his wits. I will awe him with</p>

<p>my cudgel; it shall hang like a meteor o’er the</p>

<p>cuckold’s horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I</p>

<p>will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt</p>

<p>lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night. Ford’s</p>

<p>a knave, and I will aggravate his style. Thou, Master</p>

<p>Brook, shalt know him for knave and cuckold.</p>

<p>Come to me soon at night.     <i><i>[Falstaff exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ford</span>  What a damned epicurean rascal is this! My</p>

<p>heart is ready to crack with impatience. Who says</p>

<p>this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath sent</p>

<p>to him, the hour is fixed, the match is made.</p>

<p>Would any man have thought this? See the hell of</p>

<p>having a false woman: my bed shall be abused, my</p>

<p>coffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn at. And</p>

<p>I shall not only receive this villainous wrong but</p>

<p>stand under the adoption of abominable terms,</p>

<p>and by him that does me this wrong. Terms,</p>

<p>names! “Amaimon” sounds well, “Lucifer” well,</p>

<p>“Barbason” well; yet they are devils’ additions, the</p>

<p>names of fiends. But “Cuckold,” “Wittoll,” “Cuckold”!</p>

<p>The devil himself hath not such a name. Page</p>

<p>is an ass, a secure ass. He will trust his wife, he will</p>

<p>not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with</p>

<p>my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my</p>

<p>cheese, an Irishman with my aquavitae bottle, or</p>

<p>a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife</p>

<p>with herself. Then she plots, then she ruminates,</p>

<p>then she devises; and what they think in their</p>

<p>hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts</p>

<p>but they will effect. God be praised for my jealousy!</p>

<p>Eleven o’clock the hour. I will prevent this,</p>

<p>detect my wife, be revenged on Falstaff, and laugh</p>

<p>at Page. I will about it. Better three hours too soon</p>

<p>than a minute too late. Fie, fie, fie! Cuckold, cuckold,</p>

<p>cuckold!</p>
