<p><center><i>[Enter Fenton and Host.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Master Fenton, talk not to me. My mind is</p>

<p>heavy. I will give over all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc></p>

<p>Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,</p>

<p>And, as I am a gentleman, I’ll give thee</p>

<p>A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  I will hear you, Master Fenton, and I will, at the</p>

<p>least, keep your counsel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc></p>

<p>From time to time I have acquainted you</p>

<p>With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page,</p>

<p>Who mutually hath answered my affection,</p>

<p>So far forth as herself might be her chooser,</p>

<p>Even to my wish. I have a letter from her</p>

<p>Of such contents as you will wonder at,</p>

<p>The mirth whereof so larded with my matter</p>

<p>That neither singly can be manifested</p>

<p>Without the show of both. Fat Falstaff</p>

<p>Hath a great scene; the image of the jest</p>

<p>I’ll show you here at large. <i>[He shows the Host a</p>

<p>paper.]</i> Hark, good mine Host:</p>

<p>Tonight at Herne’s oak, just ’twixt twelve and one,</p>

<p>Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen–</p>

<p>The purpose why is here–in which disguise,</p>

<p>While other jests are something rank on foot,</p>

<p>Her father hath commanded her to slip</p>

<p>Away with Slender, and with him at Eton</p>

<p>Immediately to marry. She hath consented. Now, sir,</p>

<p>Her mother, ever strong against that match</p>

<p>And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed</p>

<p>That he shall likewise shuffle her away,</p>

<p>While other sports are tasking of their minds,</p>

<p>And at the dean’ry, where a priest attends,</p>

<p>Straight marry her. To this her mother’s plot</p>

<p>She, seemingly obedient, likewise hath</p>

<p>Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:</p>

<p>Her father means she shall be all in white,</p>

<p>And in that habit, when Slender sees his time</p>

<p>To take her by the hand and bid her go,</p>

<p>She shall go with him. Her mother hath intended</p>

<p>The better to denote her to the doctor–</p>

<p>For they must all be masked and vizarded–</p>

<p>That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,</p>

<p>With ribbons pendent flaring ’bout her head;</p>

<p>And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,</p>

<p>To pinch her by the hand, and on that token</p>

<p>The maid hath given consent to go with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc></p>

<p>Which means she to deceive, father or mother?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc></p>

<p>Both, my good Host, to go along with me.</p>

<p>And here it rests, that you’ll procure the vicar</p>

<p>To stay for me at church ’twixt twelve and one,</p>

<p>And, in the lawful name of marrying,</p>

<p>To give our hearts united ceremony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc></p>

<p>Well, husband your device. I’ll to the vicar.</p>

<p>Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fenton</sc></p>

<p>So shall I evermore be bound to thee;</p>

<p>Besides, I’ll make a present recompense.</p>
