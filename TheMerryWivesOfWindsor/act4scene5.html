<p><center><i>[Enter Host and Simple.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  What wouldst thou have, boor? What, thickskin?</p>

<p>Speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick,</p>

<p>snap.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simple</sc>  Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff</p>

<p>from Master Slender.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  There’s his chamber, his house, his castle, his</p>

<p>standing-bed and truckle-bed. ’Tis painted about</p>

<p>with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go,</p>

<p>knock and call. He’ll speak like an Anthropophaginian</p>

<p>unto thee. Knock, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simple</sc>  There’s an old woman, a fat woman, gone up</p>

<p>into his chamber. I’ll be so bold as stay, sir, till she</p>

<p>come down. I come to speak with her, indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Ha? A fat woman? The knight may be robbed.</p>

<p>I’ll call.–Bully knight! Bully Sir John! Speak from</p>

<p>thy lungs military. Art thou there? It is thine Host,</p>

<p>thine Ephesian, calls.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[within]</i>  How now, mine Host?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Here’s a Bohemian Tartar tarries the coming</p>

<p>down of thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let</p>

<p>her descend. My chambers are honorable. Fie! Privacy?</p>

<p>Fie!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  There was, mine Host, an old fat woman</p>

<p>even now with me, but she’s gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simple</sc>  Pray you, sir, was ’t not the wise woman of</p>

<p>Brentford?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell. What would</p>

<p>you with her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simple</sc>  My master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her,</p>

<p>seeing her go through the streets, to know, sir,</p>

<p>whether one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain,</p>

<p>had the chain or no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I spake with the old woman about it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simple</sc>  And what says she, I pray, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Marry, she says that the very same man that</p>

<p>beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him</p>

<p>of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simple</sc>  I would I could have spoken with the woman</p>

<p>herself. I had other things to have spoken with her</p>

<p>too from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What are they? Let us know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Ay, come. Quick!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simple</sc>  I may not conceal them, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Conceal them, or thou diest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simple</sc>  Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress</p>

<p>Anne Page, to know if it were my master’s fortune</p>

<p>to have her or no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  ’Tis; ’tis his fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simple</sc>  What, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  To have her or no. Go. Say the woman told</p>

<p>me so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simple</sc>  May I be bold to say so, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Ay, sir; like who more bold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simple</sc>  I thank your Worship. I shall make my master</p>

<p>glad with these tidings.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was</p>

<p>there a wise woman with thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Ay, that there was, mine Host, one that hath</p>

<p>taught me more wit than ever I learned before in</p>

<p>my life. And I paid nothing for it neither, but was</p>

<p>paid for my learning.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bardolph.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc> <i>[to Host]</i>  Out, alas, sir, cozenage, mere</p>

<p>cozenage!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Where be my horses? Speak well of them,</p>

<p>varletto.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Run away with the cozeners. For so soon as</p>

<p>I came beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind</p>

<p>one of them in a slough of mire, and set</p>

<p>spurs, and away, like three German devils, three</p>

<p>Doctor Faustuses.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  They are gone but to meet the Duke, villain. Do</p>

<p>not say they be fled. Germans are honest men.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Hugh Evans.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Where is mine Host?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  What is the matter, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sir</sc> <sc>Hugh</sc>  Have a care of your entertainments. There is</p>

<p>a friend of mine come to town tells me there is</p>

<p>three cozen-Germans that has cozened all the</p>

<p>hosts of Readings, of Maidenhead, of Colnbrook,</p>

<p>of horses and money. I tell you for good will, look</p>

<p>you. You are wise, and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks,</p>

<p>and ’tis not convenient you should be cozened.</p>

<p>Fare you well.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Doctor Caius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc> <sc>Caius</sc>  Vere is mine Host de Jarteer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Here, Master Doctor, in perplexity and doubtful</p>

<p>dilemma.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc> <sc>Caius</sc>  I cannot tell vat is dat. But it is tell-a me</p>

<p>dat you make grand preparation for a duke de</p>

<p>Jamanie. By my trot, dere is no duke that the court</p>

<p>is know to come. I tell you for good will. Adieu.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc> <i>[to Bardolph]</i>  Hue and cry, villain, go!–Assist</p>

<p>me, knight. I am undone.–Fly, run; hue and cry,</p>

<p>villain! I am undone.     <i><i>[Host and Bardolph exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I would all the world might be cozened, for I</p>

<p>have been cozened and beaten too. If it should</p>

<p>come to the ear of the court how I have been transformed,</p>

<p>and how my transformation hath been</p>

<p>washed and cudgeled, they would melt me out of</p>

<p>my fat drop by drop, and liquor fishermen’s boots</p>

<p>with me. I warrant they would whip me with their</p>

<p>fine wits till I were as crestfallen as a dried pear. I</p>

<p>never prospered since I forswore myself at</p>

<p>primero. Well, if my wind were but long enough, I</p>

<p>would repent.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Quickly.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now, whence come you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  From the two parties, forsooth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  The devil take one party, and his dam the</p>

<p>other, and so they shall be both bestowed. I have</p>

<p>suffered more for their sakes, more than the villainous</p>

<p>inconstancy of man’s disposition is able to</p>

<p>bear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  And have not they suffered? Yes, I</p>

<p>warrant, speciously one of them. Mistress Ford,</p>

<p>good heart, is beaten black and blue that you cannot</p>

<p>see a white spot about her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What tell’st thou me of black and blue? I was</p>

<p>beaten myself into all the colors of the rainbow,</p>

<p>and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of</p>

<p>Brentford. But that my admirable dexterity of wit,</p>

<p>my counterfeiting the action of an old woman, delivered</p>

<p>me, the knave constable had set me i’ th’</p>

<p>stocks, i’ th’ common stocks, for a witch.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mistress</sc> <sc>Quickly</sc>  Sir, let me speak with you in your</p>

<p>chamber. You shall hear how things go, and, I warrant,</p>

<p>to your content. Here is a letter will say</p>

<p>somewhat. <i>[She gives him a paper.]</i> Good hearts,</p>

<p>what ado here is to bring you together! Sure, one</p>

<p>of you does not serve heaven well, that you are so</p>

<p>crossed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Come up into my chamber.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
