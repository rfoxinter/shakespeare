<p><center><i>[Alarum. Enter Richard, Duke of York, wearing the</p>

<p>white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>The army of the Queen hath got the field.</p>

<p>My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;</p>

<p>And all my followers to the eager foe</p>

<p>Turn back and fly like ships before the wind,</p>

<p>Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.</p>

<p>My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them;</p>

<p>But this I know: they have demeaned themselves</p>

<p>Like men borne to renown by life or death.</p>

<p>Three times did Richard make a lane to me</p>

<p>And thrice cried “Courage, father, fight it out!”</p>

<p>And full as oft came Edward to my side,</p>

<p>With purple falchion painted to the hilt</p>

<p>In blood of those that had encountered him;</p>

<p>And when the hardiest warriors did retire,</p>

<p>Richard cried “Charge, and give no foot of ground!”</p>

<p>And cried “A crown or else a glorious tomb;</p>

<p>A scepter or an earthly sepulcher!”</p>

<p>With this we charged again; but, out alas,</p>

<p>We budged again, as I have seen a swan</p>

<p>With bootless labor swim against the tide</p>

<p>And spend her strength with over-matching waves.</p>

<p><center><i>[A short alarum within.]</i></center></p>

<p>Ah, hark, the fatal followers do pursue,</p>

<p>And I am faint and cannot fly their fury;</p>

<p>And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.</p>

<p>The sands are numbered that makes up my life.</p>

<p>Here must I stay, and here my life must end.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Queen Margaret, Clifford, Northumberland,</p>

<p>the young Prince Edward, and Soldiers,</p>

<p>all wearing the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,</p>

<p>I dare your quenchless fury to more rage.</p>

<p>I am your butt, and I abide your shot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clifford</sc></p>

<p>Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm</p>

<p>With downright payment showed unto my father.</p>

<p>Now Phaeton hath tumbled from his car</p>

<p>And made an evening at the noontide prick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>My ashes, as the Phoenix’, may bring forth</p>

<p>A bird that will revenge upon you all;</p>

<p>And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,</p>

<p>Scorning whate’er you can afflict me with.</p>

<p>Why come you not? What, multitudes, and fear?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clifford</sc></p>

<p>So cowards fight when they can fly no further;</p>

<p>So doves do peck the falcon’s piercing talons;</p>

<p>So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,</p>

<p>Breathe out invectives ’gainst the officers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>O Clifford, but bethink thee once again</p>

<p>And in thy thought o’errun my former time;</p>

<p>And, if thou canst for blushing, view this face</p>

<p>And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice</p>

<p>Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clifford</sc></p>

<p>I will not bandy with thee word for word,</p>

<p>But buckler with thee blows twice two for one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Hold, valiant Clifford, for a thousand causes</p>

<p>I would prolong a while the traitor’s life.–</p>

<p>Wrath makes him deaf; speak thou, Northumberland.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Hold, Clifford, do not honor him so much</p>

<p>To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart.</p>

<p>What valor were it when a cur doth grin</p>

<p>For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,</p>

<p>When he might spurn him with his foot away?</p>

<p>It is war’s prize to take all vantages,</p>

<p>And ten to one is no impeach of valor.</p>

<p><center><i>[They attack York.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clifford</sc></p>

<p>Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>So doth the coney struggle in the net.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>So triumph thieves upon their conquered booty;</p>

<p>So true men yield with robbers, so o’ermatched.</p>

<p><center><i>[York is overcome.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc> <i>[to Queen Margaret]</i></p>

<p>What would your Grace have done unto him now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,</p>

<p>Come, make him stand upon this molehill here</p>

<p>That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,</p>

<p>Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.</p>

<p><center><i>[They place York on a small prominence.]</i></center></p>

<p>What, was it you that would be England’s king?</p>

<p>Was ’t you that reveled in our parliament</p>

<p>And made a preachment of your high descent?</p>

<p>Where are your mess of sons to back you now,</p>

<p>The wanton Edward and the lusty George?</p>

<p>And where’s that valiant crookback prodigy,</p>

<p>Dickie, your boy, that with his grumbling voice</p>

<p>Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?</p>

<p>Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?</p>

<p>Look, York, I stained this napkin with the blood</p>

<p>That valiant Clifford with his rapier’s point</p>

<p>Made issue from the bosom of the boy;</p>

<p>And if thine eyes can water for his death,</p>

<p>I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.</p>

<p><center><i>[She gives him a bloody cloth.]</i></center></p>

<p>Alas, poor York, but that I hate thee deadly</p>

<p>I should lament thy miserable state.</p>

<p>I prithee grieve to make me merry, York.</p>

<p>What, hath thy fiery heart so parched thine entrails</p>

<p>That not a tear can fall for Rutland’s death?</p>

<p>Why art thou patient, man? Thou shouldst be mad;</p>

<p>And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.</p>

<p>Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.</p>

<p>Thou would’st be fee’d, I see, to make me sport.–</p>

<p>York cannot speak unless he wear a crown.</p>

<p>A crown for York!     <i><i>[She is handed a paper crown.]</i></i></p>

<p>And, lords, bow low to him.</p>

<p>Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on.</p>

<p><center><i>[She puts the crown on York’s head.]</i></center></p>

<p>Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king.</p>

<p>Ay, this is he that took King Henry’s chair,</p>

<p>And this is he was his adopted heir.</p>

<p>But how is it that great Plantagenet</p>

<p>Is crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath?–</p>

<p>As I bethink me, you should not be king</p>

<p>Till our King Henry had shook hands with Death.</p>

<p>And will you pale your head in Henry’s glory</p>

<p>And rob his temples of the diadem</p>

<p>Now, in his life, against your holy oath?</p>

<p>O, ’tis a fault too too unpardonable.</p>

<p>Off with the crown and, with the crown, his head;</p>

<p>And whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clifford</sc></p>

<p>That is my office, for my father’s sake.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Nay, stay, let’s hear the orisons he makes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of</p>

<p>France,</p>

<p>Whose tongue more poisons than the adder’s tooth:</p>

<p>How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex</p>

<p>To triumph like an Amazonian trull</p>

<p>Upon their woes whom Fortune captivates.</p>

<p>But that thy face is vizard-like, unchanging,</p>

<p>Made impudent with use of evil deeds,</p>

<p>I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.</p>

<p>To tell thee whence thou cam’st, of whom derived,</p>

<p>Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not</p>

<p>shameless.</p>

<p>Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,</p>

<p>Of both the Sicils, and Jerusalem,</p>

<p>Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.</p>

<p>Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?</p>

<p>It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,</p>

<p>Unless the adage must be verified</p>

<p>That beggars mounted run their horse to death.</p>

<p>’Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud,</p>

<p>But God He knows thy share thereof is small.</p>

<p>’Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;</p>

<p>The contrary doth make thee wondered at.</p>

<p>’Tis government that makes them seem divine;</p>

<p>The want thereof makes thee abominable.</p>

<p>Thou art as opposite to every good</p>

<p>As the Antipodes are unto us</p>

<p>Or as the south to the Septentrion.</p>

<p>O, tiger’s heart wrapped in a woman’s hide,</p>

<p>How couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child</p>

<p>To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,</p>

<p>And yet be seen to bear a woman’s face?</p>

<p>Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible;</p>

<p>Thou, stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.</p>

<p>Bidd’st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish.</p>

<p>Wouldst have me weep? Why, now thou hast thy will;</p>

<p>For raging wind blows up incessant showers,</p>

<p>And when the rage allays, the rain begins.</p>

<p>These tears are my sweet Rutland’s obsequies,</p>

<p>And every drop cries vengeance for his death</p>

<p>’Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false</p>

<p>Frenchwoman!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Beshrew me, but his passions moves me so</p>

<p>That hardly can I check my eyes from tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>That face of his the hungry cannibals</p>

<p>Would not have touched, would not have stained</p>

<p>with blood;</p>

<p>But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,</p>

<p>O, ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania.</p>

<p>See, ruthless queen, a hapless father’s tears.</p>

<p>This cloth thou dipped’st in blood of my sweet boy,</p>

<p>And I with tears do wash the blood away.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands her the cloth.]</i></center></p>

<p>Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this;</p>

<p>And if thou tell’st the heavy story right,</p>

<p>Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears.</p>

<p>Yea, even my foes will shed fast-falling tears</p>

<p>And say “Alas, it was a piteous deed.”</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands her the paper crown.]</i></center></p>

<p>There, take the crown and, with the crown, my</p>

<p>curse,</p>

<p>And in thy need such comfort come to thee</p>

<p>As now I reap at thy too cruel hand.–</p>

<p>Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world,</p>

<p>My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Had he been slaughterman to all my kin,</p>

<p>I should not for my life but weep with him</p>

<p>To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>What, weeping ripe, my Lord Northumberland?</p>

<p>Think but upon the wrong he did us all,</p>

<p>And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clifford</sc> <i>[stabbing York twice]</i></p>

<p>Here’s for my oath; here’s for my father’s death!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[stabbing York]</i></p>

<p>And here’s to right our gentle-hearted king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Open thy gate of mercy, gracious God.</p>

<p>My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[He dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Off with his head, and set it on York gates,</p>

<p>So York may overlook the town of York.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. They exit, Soldiers carrying York’s body.]</i></center></p>
