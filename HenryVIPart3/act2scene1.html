<p><center><i>[A march. Enter Edward, Richard, and their power,</p>

<p>all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>I wonder how our princely father scaped,</p>

<p>Or whether he be scaped away or no</p>

<p>From Clifford’s and Northumberland’s pursuit.</p>

<p>Had he been ta’en, we should have heard the news;</p>

<p>Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;</p>

<p>Or had he scaped, methinks we should have heard</p>

<p>The happy tidings of his good escape.</p>

<p>How fares my brother? Why is he so sad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I cannot joy until I be resolved</p>

<p>Where our right valiant father is become.</p>

<p>I saw him in the battle range about</p>

<p>And watched him how he singled Clifford forth.</p>

<p>Methought he bore him in the thickest troop</p>

<p>As doth a lion in a herd of neat,</p>

<p>Or as a bear encompassed round with dogs,</p>

<p>Who having pinched a few and made them cry,</p>

<p>The rest stand all aloof and bark at him;</p>

<p>So fared our father with his enemies;</p>

<p>So fled his enemies my warlike father.</p>

<p>Methinks ’tis prize enough to be his son.</p>

<p>See how the morning opes her golden gates</p>

<p>And takes her farewell of the glorious sun.</p>

<p>How well resembles it the prime of youth,</p>

<p>Trimmed like a younker, prancing to his love!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun,</p>

<p>Not separated with the racking clouds</p>

<p>But severed in a pale clear-shining sky.</p>

<p>See, see, they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,</p>

<p>As if they vowed some league inviolable.</p>

<p>Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun;</p>

<p>In this, the heaven figures some event.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>’Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.</p>

<p>I think it cites us, brother, to the field,</p>

<p>That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,</p>

<p>Each one already blazing by our meeds,</p>

<p>Should notwithstanding join our lights together</p>

<p>And overshine the earth, as this the world.</p>

<p>Whate’er it bodes, henceforward will I bear</p>

<p>Upon my target three fair shining suns.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,</p>

<p>You love the breeder better than the male.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger, blowing.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell</p>

<p>Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on</p>

<p>Whenas the noble Duke of York was slain,</p>

<p>Your princely father and my loving lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>O, speak no more, for I have heard too much!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Say how he died, for I will hear it all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Environed he was with many foes,</p>

<p>And stood against them, as the hope of Troy</p>

<p>Against the Greeks that would have entered Troy.</p>

<p>But Hercules himself must yield to odds;</p>

<p>And many strokes, though with a little axe,</p>

<p>Hews down and fells the hardest-timbered oak.</p>

<p>By many hands your father was subdued,</p>

<p>But only slaughtered by the ireful arm</p>

<p>Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen,</p>

<p>Who crowned the gracious duke in high despite,</p>

<p>Laughed in his face; and when with grief he wept,</p>

<p>The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks</p>

<p>A napkin steeped in the harmless blood</p>

<p>Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain.</p>

<p>And after many scorns, many foul taunts,</p>

<p>They took his head and on the gates of York</p>

<p>They set the same, and there it doth remain,</p>

<p>The saddest spectacle that e’er I viewed.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,</p>

<p>Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.</p>

<p>O Clifford, boist’rous Clifford, thou hast slain</p>

<p>The flower of Europe for his chivalry;</p>

<p>And treacherously hast thou vanquished him,</p>

<p>For hand to hand he would have vanquished thee.</p>

<p>Now my soul’s palace is become a prison;</p>

<p>Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body</p>

<p>Might in the ground be closed up in rest,</p>

<p>For never henceforth shall I joy again.</p>

<p>Never, O never, shall I see more joy!     <i><i>[He weeps.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I cannot weep, for all my body’s moisture</p>

<p>Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart;</p>

<p>Nor can my tongue unload my heart’s great burden,</p>

<p>For selfsame wind that I should speak withal</p>

<p>Is kindling coals that fires all my breast</p>

<p>And burns me up with flames that tears would</p>

<p>quench.</p>

<p>To weep is to make less the depth of grief:</p>

<p>Tears, then, for babes; blows and revenge for me.</p>

<p>Richard, I bear thy name. I’ll venge thy death</p>

<p>Or die renowned by attempting it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;</p>

<p>His dukedom and his chair with me is left.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Nay, if thou be that princely eagle’s bird,</p>

<p>Show thy descent by gazing ’gainst the sun;</p>

<p>For “chair” and “dukedom,” “throne” and</p>

<p>“kingdom” say;</p>

<p>Either that is thine or else thou wert not his.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[March. Enter Warwick, Marquess Montague, and their</p>

<p>army, all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>How now, fair lords? What fare, what news abroad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Great lord of Warwick, if we should recount</p>

<p>Our baleful news, and at each word’s deliverance</p>

<p>Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,</p>

<p>The words would add more anguish than the wounds.</p>

<p>O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>O Warwick, Warwick, that Plantagenet</p>

<p>Which held thee dearly as his soul’s redemption</p>

<p>Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Ten days ago I drowned these news in tears.</p>

<p>And now to add more measure to your woes,</p>

<p>I come to tell you things sith then befall’n.</p>

<p>After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</p>

<p>Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,</p>

<p>Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</p>

<p>Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</p>

<p>I, then in London, keeper of the King,</p>

<p>Mustered my soldiers, gathered flocks of friends,</p>

<p>Marched toward Saint Albans to intercept the</p>

<p>Queen,</p>

<p>Bearing the King in my behalf along;</p>

<p>For by my scouts I was advertised</p>

<p>That she was coming with a full intent</p>

<p>To dash our late decree in Parliament</p>

<p>Touching King Henry’s oath and your succession.</p>

<p>Short tale to make, we at Saint Albans met,</p>

<p>Our battles joined, and both sides fiercely fought.</p>

<p>But whether ’twas the coldness of the King,</p>

<p>Who looked full gently on his warlike queen,</p>

<p>That robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen,</p>

<p>Or whether ’twas report of her success</p>

<p>Or more than common fear of Clifford’s rigor,</p>

<p>Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</p>

<p>I cannot judge; but to conclude with truth,</p>

<p>Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</p>

<p>Our soldiers’, like the night owl’s lazy flight</p>

<p>Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</p>

<p>Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</p>

<p>I cheered them up with justice of our cause,</p>

<p>With promise of high pay and great rewards,</p>

<p>But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,</p>

<p>And we, in them, no hope to win the day,</p>

<p>So that we fled: the King unto the Queen;</p>

<p>Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself</p>

<p>In haste, posthaste, are come to join with you;</p>

<p>For in the Marches here we heard you were,</p>

<p>Making another head to fight again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?</p>

<p>And when came George from Burgundy to England?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers,</p>

<p>And, for your brother, he was lately sent</p>

<p>From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,</p>

<p>With aid of soldiers to this needful war.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>’Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.</p>

<p>Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,</p>

<p>But ne’er till now his scandal of retire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear?</p>

<p>For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine</p>

<p>Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry’s head</p>

<p>And wring the awful scepter from his fist,</p>

<p>Were he as famous and as bold in war</p>

<p>As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.</p>

<p>’Tis love I bear thy glories make me speak.</p>

<p>But in this troublous time, what’s to be done?</p>

<p>Shall we go throw away our coats of steel</p>

<p>And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,</p>

<p>Numb’ring our Ave Marys with our beads?</p>

<p>Or shall we on the helmets of our foes</p>

<p>Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?</p>

<p>If for the last, say “Ay,” and to it, lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out,</p>

<p>And therefore comes my brother Montague.</p>

<p>Attend me, lords: the proud insulting queen,</p>

<p>With Clifford and the haught Northumberland</p>

<p>And of their feather many more proud birds,</p>

<p>Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.</p>

<p>He swore consent to your succession,</p>

<p>His oath enrolled in the Parliament.</p>

<p>And now to London all the crew are gone</p>

<p>To frustrate both his oath and what beside</p>

<p>May make against the house of Lancaster.</p>

<p>Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.</p>

<p>Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,</p>

<p>With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,</p>

<p>Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,</p>

<p>Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,</p>

<p>Why, via, to London will we march,</p>

<p>And once again bestride our foaming steeds,</p>

<p>And once again cry “Charge!” upon our foes,</p>

<p>But never once again turn back and fly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.</p>

<p>Ne’er may he live to see a sunshine day</p>

<p>That cries “Retire!” if Warwick bid him stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,</p>

<p>And when thou fail’st–as God forbid the hour!–</p>

<p>Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;</p>

<p>The next degree is England’s royal throne:</p>

<p>For King of England shalt thou be proclaimed</p>

<p>In every borough as we pass along,</p>

<p>And he that throws not up his cap for joy</p>

<p>Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.</p>

<p>King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,</p>

<p>Stay we no longer dreaming of renown,</p>

<p>But sound the trumpets and about our task.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,</p>

<p>As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,</p>

<p>I come to pierce it or to give thee mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Then strike up drums! God and Saint George for us!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc>  How now, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,</p>

<p>The Queen is coming with a puissant host,</p>

<p>And craves your company for speedy counsel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Why, then it sorts. Brave warriors, let’s away!</p>
