<p><center><i>[Enter three Watchmen to guard King Edward’s tent,</p>

<p>all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>Come on, my masters, each man take his stand.</p>

<p>The King by this is set him down to sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  What, will he not to bed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>Why, no, for he hath made a solemn vow</p>

<p>Never to lie and take his natural rest</p>

<p>Till Warwick or himself be quite suppressed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>Tomorrow, then, belike shall be the day,</p>

<p>If Warwick be so near as men report.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>But say, I pray, what nobleman is that</p>

<p>That with the King here resteth in his tent?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>’Tis the Lord Hastings, the King’s chiefest friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>O, is it so? But why commands the King</p>

<p>That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,</p>

<p>While he himself keeps in the cold field?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>’Tis the more honor, because more dangerous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>Ay, but give me worship and quietness;</p>

<p>I like it better than a dangerous honor.</p>

<p>If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,</p>

<p>’Tis to be doubted he would waken him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent</p>

<p>But to defend his person from night foes?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Warwick, Clarence, Oxford, Somerset, all wearing</p>

<p>the red rose, and French Soldiers, silent all.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>This is his tent, and see where stand his guard.</p>

<p>Courage, my masters. Honor, now or never!</p>

<p>But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  Who goes there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  Stay, or thou diest!</p>

<p><center><i>[Warwick and the rest cry all “Warwick, Warwick!”</p>

<p>and set upon the guard, who fly, crying “Arm, Arm!”</p>

<p>Warwick and the rest following them.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The drum playing and trumpet sounding,</p>

<p>enter Warwick, Somerset, and the rest, bringing</p>

<p>King Edward out in his gown, sitting in a chair.</p>

<p>Richard and Hastings flies over the stage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>What are they that fly there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span>  Richard and Hastings.</p>

<p>Let them go. Here is the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span>  The Duke?</p>

<p>Why, Warwick, when we parted, thou call’dst me king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span>  Ay, but the case is altered.</p>

<p>When you disgraced me in my embassade,</p>

<p>Then I degraded you from being king</p>

<p>And come now to create you Duke of York.</p>

<p>Alas, how should you govern any kingdom</p>

<p>That know not how to use ambassadors,</p>

<p>Nor how to be contented with one wife,</p>

<p>Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,</p>

<p>Nor how to study for the people’s welfare,</p>

<p>Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too?</p>

<p>Nay, then, I see that Edward needs must down.</p>

<p>Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,</p>

<p>Of thee thyself and all thy complices,</p>

<p>Edward will always bear himself as king.</p>

<p>Though Fortune’s malice overthrow my state,</p>

<p>My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Then for his mind be Edward England’s king,</p>

<p><center><i>[Takes off his crown.]</i></center></p>

<p>But Henry now shall wear the English crown</p>

<p>And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.–</p>

<p>My lord of Somerset, at my request,</p>

<p>See that forthwith Duke Edward be conveyed</p>

<p>Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.</p>

<p>When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,</p>

<p>I’ll follow you and tell what answer</p>

<p>Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.–</p>

<p>Now for awhile farewell, good Duke of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[They begin to lead him out forcibly.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>What Fates impose, that men must needs abide;</p>

<p>It boots not to resist both wind and tide.</p>

<p><center><i>[Somerset and Soldiers exit, guarding King Edward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oxford</span></p>

<p>What now remains, my lords, for us to do</p>

<p>But march to London with our soldiers?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Ay, that’s the first thing that we have to do,</p>

<p>To free King Henry from imprisonment</p>

<p>And see him seated in the regal throne.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
