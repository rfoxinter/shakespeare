<p><center><i>[Enter Warwick, wearing the red rose, the Mayor of</p>

<p>Coventry, two Messengers, and others, upon the walls.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?–</p>

<p>How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>How far off is our brother Montague?</p>

<p>Where is the post that came from Montague?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter, upon the walls, Somerville</p>

<p>wearing the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?</p>

<p>And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Somerville</sc></p>

<p>At Southam I did leave him with his forces</p>

<p>And do expect him here some two hours hence.</p>

<p><center><i>[Drum offstage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Then Clarence is at hand; I hear his drum.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Somerville</sc></p>

<p>It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies.</p>

<p>The drum your Honor hears marcheth from Warwick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Who should that be? Belike unlooked-for friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Somerville</sc></p>

<p>They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[March. Flourish. Enter below, King Edward,</p>

<p>Richard, and Soldiers, including a Trumpeter,</p>

<p>all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Go, Trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>See how the surly Warwick mans the wall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>O unbid spite, is sportful Edward come?</p>

<p>Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,</p>

<p>That we could hear no news of his repair?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,</p>

<p>Speak gentle words, and humbly bend thy knee?</p>

<p>Call Edward king, and at his hands beg mercy,</p>

<p>And he shall pardon thee these outrages.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Nay, rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence,</p>

<p>Confess who set thee up and plucked thee down,</p>

<p>Call Warwick patron, and be penitent,</p>

<p>And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I thought at least he would have said “the King.”</p>

<p>Or did he make the jest against his will?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give.</p>

<p>I’ll do thee service for so good a gift.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>’Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Why, then, ’tis mine, if but by Warwick’s gift.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight;</p>

<p>And, weakling, Warwick takes his gift again,</p>

<p>And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>But Warwick’s king is Edward’s prisoner.</p>

<p>And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:</p>

<p>What is the body when the head is off?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,</p>

<p>But whiles he thought to steal the single ten,</p>

<p>The King was slyly fingered from the deck.</p>

<p>You left poor Henry at the Bishop’s palace,</p>

<p>And ten to one you’ll meet him in the Tower.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>’Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel</p>

<p>down.</p>

<p>Nay, when? Strike now, or else the iron cools.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>I had rather chop this hand off at a blow</p>

<p>And with the other fling it at thy face</p>

<p>Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,</p>

<p>This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair,</p>

<p>Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,</p>

<p>Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood:</p>

<p>“Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.”</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Oxford, below, wearing the red rose,</p>

<p>with Soldiers, Drum and Colors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>O, cheerful colors, see where Oxford comes!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oxford</sc>  Oxford, Oxford for Lancaster!</p>

<p><center><i>[Oxford and his troops exit as through a city gate.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>The gates are open; let us enter too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>So other foes may set upon our backs.</p>

<p>Stand we in good array, for they no doubt</p>

<p>Will issue out again and bid us battle.</p>

<p>If not, the city being but of small defense,</p>

<p>We’ll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Oxford enters aloft.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>O welcome, Oxford, for we want thy help.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Montague, below, wearing the red rose,</p>

<p>with Soldiers, Drum and Colors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montague</sc>  Montague, Montague for Lancaster!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason</p>

<p>Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear!</p>

<p><center><i>[Montague and his troops exit as through a city gate.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>The harder matched, the greater victory.</p>

<p>My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Somerset, below, wearing the red rose,</p>

<p>with Soldiers, Drum and Colors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Somerset</sc>  Somerset, Somerset for Lancaster!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Two of thy name, both dukes of Somerset,</p>

<p>Have sold their lives unto the house of York,</p>

<p>And thou shalt be the third, if this sword hold.</p>

<p><center><i>[Somerset and his troops exit as through a city gate.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Clarence, below, wearing the red rose,</p>

<p>with Soldiers, Drum and Colors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,</p>

<p>Of force enough to bid his brother battle,</p>

<p>With whom an upright zeal to right prevails</p>

<p>More than the nature of a brother’s love.–</p>

<p>Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clarence</sc></p>

<p>Father of Warwick, know you what this means?</p>

<p><center><i>[He removes the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<p>Look, here I throw my infamy at thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[He throws the rose at Warwick.]</i></center></p>

<p>I will not ruinate my father’s house,</p>

<p>Who gave his blood to lime the stones together</p>

<p>And set up Lancaster. Why, trowest thou, Warwick,</p>

<p>That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,</p>

<p>To bend the fatal instruments of war</p>

<p>Against his brother and his lawful king?</p>

<p>Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath.</p>

<p>To keep that oath were more impiety</p>

<p>Than Jephthah when he sacrificed his daughter.</p>

<p>I am so sorry for my trespass made</p>

<p>That, to deserve well at my brother’s hands,</p>

<p>I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,</p>

<p>With resolution, wheresoe’er I meet thee–</p>

<p>As I will meet thee if thou stir abroad–</p>

<p>To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.</p>

<p>And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee</p>

<p>And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.–</p>

<p>Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends.–</p>

<p>And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,</p>

<p>For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Now, welcome more, and ten times more beloved,</p>

<p>Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Welcome, good Clarence; this is brother-like.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>O, passing traitor, perjured and unjust.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?</p>

<p>Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Alas, I am not cooped here for defense.</p>

<p>I will away towards Barnet presently</p>

<p>And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou dar’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.–</p>

<p><center><i>[Warwick exits from the walls and descends.]</i></center></p>

<p>Lords, to the field! Saint George and victory!</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit. March. Warwick and his company follows.]</i></center></p>
