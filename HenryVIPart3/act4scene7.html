<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King Edward, Richard, Hastings,</p>

<p>and Soldiers, all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest:</p>

<p>Yet thus far Fortune maketh us amends,</p>

<p>And says that once more I shall interchange</p>

<p>My waned state for Henry’s regal crown.</p>

<p>Well have we passed, and now re-passed, the seas,</p>

<p>And brought desired help from Burgundy.</p>

<p>What then remains, we being thus arrived</p>

<p>From Ravenspurgh Haven before the gates of York,</p>

<p>But that we enter as into our dukedom?</p>

<p><center><i>[Hastings knocks at the gate.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>The gates made fast? Brother, I like not this.</p>

<p>For many men that stumble at the threshold</p>

<p>Are well foretold that danger lurks within.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us.</p>

<p>By fair or foul means we must enter in,</p>

<p>For hither will our friends repair to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>My liege, I’ll knock once more to summon them.</p>

<p><center><i>[He knocks.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter on the walls the Mayor of York and his brethren,</p>

<p>the Aldermen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mayor</span></p>

<p>My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,</p>

<p>And shut the gates for safety of ourselves,</p>

<p>For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,</p>

<p>Yet Edward, at the least, is Duke of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mayor</span></p>

<p>True, my good lord, I know you for no less.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,</p>

<p>As being well content with that alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>But when the fox hath once got in his nose,</p>

<p>He’ll soon find means to make the body follow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?</p>

<p>Open the gates. We are King Henry’s friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mayor</span></p>

<p>Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be opened.</p>

<p><center><i>[He descends with the Aldermen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>The good old man would fain that all were well,</p>

<p>So ’twere not long of him; but being entered,</p>

<p>I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade</p>

<p>Both him and all his brothers unto reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>So, master mayor, these gates must not be shut</p>

<p>But in the night or in the time of war.</p>

<p>What, fear not, man, but yield me up the keys.</p>

<p><center><i>[Takes his keys.]</i></center></p>

<p>For Edward will defend the town and thee</p>

<p>And all those friends that deign to follow me.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[March. Enter Montgomery, with Drum and Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,</p>

<p>Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Welcome, Sir John. But why come you in arms?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montgomery</span></p>

<p>To help King Edward in his time of storm,</p>

<p>As every loyal subject ought to do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Thanks, good Montgomery. But we now forget</p>

<p>Our title to the crown, and only claim</p>

<p>Our dukedom, till God please to send the rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montgomery</span></p>

<p>Then fare you well, for I will hence again.</p>

<p>I came to serve a king and not a duke.–</p>

<p>Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Drum begins to march.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we’ll debate</p>

<p>By what safe means the crown may be recovered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montgomery</span></p>

<p>What talk you of debating? In few words,</p>

<p>If you’ll not here proclaim yourself our king,</p>

<p>I’ll leave you to your fortune and be gone</p>

<p>To keep them back that come to succor you.</p>

<p>Why shall we fight if you pretend no title?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>When we grow stronger, then we’ll make our claim.</p>

<p>Till then ’tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.</p>

<p>Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand;</p>

<p>The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Then be it as you will, for ’tis my right,</p>

<p>And Henry but usurps the diadem.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montgomery</span></p>

<p>Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself,</p>

<p>And now will I be Edward’s champion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Sound, trumpet! Edward shall be here proclaimed.–</p>

<p>Come, fellow soldier, make thou proclamation.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. Sound.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soldier</span> <i>[reads]</i>  Edward the Fourth, by the Grace of</p>

<p>God, King of England and France, and Lord of</p>

<p>Ireland, &c.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montgomery</span></p>

<p>And whosoe’er gainsays King Edward’s right,</p>

<p>By this I challenge him to single fight.</p>

<p><center><i>[Throws down his gauntlet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  Long live Edward the Fourth!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Thanks, brave Montgomery, and thanks unto you all.</p>

<p>If fortune serve me, I’ll requite this kindness.</p>

<p>Now, for this night let’s harbor here in York,</p>

<p>And when the morning sun shall raise his car</p>

<p>Above the border of this horizon,</p>

<p>We’ll forward towards Warwick and his mates;</p>

<p>For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.</p>

<p>Ah, froward Clarence, how evil it beseems thee</p>

<p>To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!</p>

<p>Yet, as we may, we’ll meet both thee and Warwick.</p>

<p>Come on, brave soldiers; doubt not of the day;</p>

<p>And that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
