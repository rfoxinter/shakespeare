<p><center><i>[Alarum. Enter Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York;</p>

<p>Edward; Richard; Norfolk; Montague; Warwick; and</p>

<p>Soldiers, all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>I wonder how the King escaped our hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>While we pursued the horsemen of the north,</p>

<p>He slyly stole away and left his men;</p>

<p>Whereat the great lord of Northumberland,</p>

<p>Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,</p>

<p>Cheered up the drooping army; and himself,</p>

<p>Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,</p>

<p>Charged our main battle’s front and, breaking in,</p>

<p>Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Lord Stafford’s father, Duke of Buckingham,</p>

<p>Is either slain or wounded dangerous.</p>

<p>I cleft his beaver with a downright blow.</p>

<p>That this is true, father, behold his blood.</p>

<p><center><i>[He shows his bloody sword.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montague</span> <i>[to York, showing his sword]</i></p>

<p>And, brother, here’s the Earl of Wiltshire’s blood,</p>

<p>Whom I encountered as the battles joined.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[holding up a severed head]</i></p>

<p>Speak thou for me, and tell them what I did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.</p>

<p>But is your Grace dead, my lord of Somerset?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span></p>

<p>Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Thus do I hope to shake King Henry’s head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>And so do I, victorious prince of York.</p>

<p>Before I see thee seated in that throne</p>

<p>Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,</p>

<p>I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.</p>

<p>This is the palace of the fearful king,</p>

<p>And this the regal seat. Possess it, York,</p>

<p>For this is thine and not King Henry’s heirs’.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will,</p>

<p>For hither we have broken in by force.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span></p>

<p>We’ll all assist you. He that flies shall die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords.–</p>

<p>And soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.</p>

<p><center><i>[They go up onto a dais or platform.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>And when the King comes, offer him no violence</p>

<p>Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.</p>

<p><center><i>[Soldiers exit or retire out of sight.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>The Queen this day here holds her parliament,</p>

<p>But little thinks we shall be of her council.</p>

<p>By words or blows, here let us win our right.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Armed as we are, let’s stay within this house.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>“The Bloody Parliament” shall this be called</p>

<p>Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king</p>

<p>And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice</p>

<p>Hath made us bywords to our enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute.</p>

<p>I mean to take possession of my right.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Neither the King nor he that loves him best,</p>

<p>The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,</p>

<p>Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.</p>

<p>I’ll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.</p>

<p>Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.</p>

<p><center><i>[York sits in the chair of state.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King Henry, Clifford, Northumberland,</p>

<p>Westmorland, Exeter, and the rest, all wearing</p>

<p>the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,</p>

<p>Even in the chair of state! Belike he means,</p>

<p>Backed by the power of Warwick, that false peer,</p>

<p>To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.</p>

<p>Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father,</p>

<p>And thine, Lord Clifford, and you both have vowed</p>

<p>revenge</p>

<p>On him, his sons, his favorites, and his friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmorland</span></p>

<p>What, shall we suffer this? Let’s pluck him down.</p>

<p>My heart for anger burns. I cannot brook it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmorland.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>Patience is for poltroons such as he.</p>

<p>He durst not sit there had your father lived.</p>

<p>My gracious lord, here in the Parliament</p>

<p>Let us assail the family of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Well hast thou spoken, cousin. Be it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Ah, know you not the city favors them,</p>

<p>And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>But when the Duke is slain, they’ll quickly fly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Far be the thought of this from Henry’s heart,</p>

<p>To make a shambles of the Parliament House!</p>

<p>Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats</p>

<p>Shall be the war that Henry means to use.–</p>

<p>Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne</p>

<p>And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet.</p>

<p>I am thy sovereign.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  I am thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>For shame, come down. He made thee Duke of</p>

<p>York.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>It was my inheritance, as the earldom was.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>Thy father was a traitor to the crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown</p>

<p>In following this usurping Henry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>Whom should he follow but his natural king?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>True, Clifford, that’s Richard, Duke of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[to York]</i></p>

<p>And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>It must and shall be so. Content thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span> <i>[to King Henry]</i></p>

<p>Be Duke of Lancaster. Let him be king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmorland</span></p>

<p>He is both king and Duke of Lancaster,</p>

<p>And that the lord of Westmorland shall maintain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget</p>

<p>That we are those which chased you from the field</p>

<p>And slew your fathers and, with colors spread,</p>

<p>Marched through the city to the palace gates.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;</p>

<p>And by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmorland</span></p>

<p>Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,</p>

<p>Thy kinsmen, and thy friends, I’ll have more lives</p>

<p>Than drops of blood were in my father’s veins.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>Urge it no more, lest that, instead of words,</p>

<p>I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger</p>

<p>As shall revenge his death before I stir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Will you we show our title to the crown?</p>

<p>If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?</p>

<p>Thy father was as thou art, Duke of York;</p>

<p>Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March.</p>

<p>I am the son of Henry the Fifth,</p>

<p>Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop</p>

<p>And seized upon their towns and provinces.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>The Lord Protector lost it and not I.</p>

<p>When I was crowned, I was but nine months old.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you</p>

<p>lose.–</p>

<p>Father, tear the crown from the usurper’s head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Sweet father, do so. Set it on your head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montague</span> <i>[to York]</i></p>

<p>Good brother, as thou lov’st and honorest arms,</p>

<p>Let’s fight it out and not stand caviling thus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  Sons, peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Peace thou, and give King Henry leave to speak!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords,</p>

<p>And be you silent and attentive too,</p>

<p>For he that interrupts him shall not live.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Think’st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,</p>

<p>Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?</p>

<p>No. First shall war unpeople this my realm;</p>

<p>Ay, and their colors, often borne in France,</p>

<p>And now in England to our heart’s great sorrow,</p>

<p>Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?</p>

<p>My title’s good, and better far than his.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>’Twas by rebellion against his king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I know not what to say; my title’s weak.–</p>

<p>Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  What then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>An if he may, then am I lawful king;</p>

<p>For Richard, in the view of many lords,</p>

<p>Resigned the crown to Henry the Fourth,</p>

<p>Whose heir my father was, and I am his.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>He rose against him, being his sovereign,</p>

<p>And made him to resign his crown perforce.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrained,</p>

<p>Think you ’twere prejudicial to his crown?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>No, for he could not so resign his crown</p>

<p>But that the next heir should succeed and reign.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>His is the right, and therefore pardon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>My conscience tells me he is lawful king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>All will revolt from me and turn to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span> <i>[to York]</i></p>

<p>Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay’st,</p>

<p>Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Thou art deceived. ’Tis not thy southern power</p>

<p>Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,</p>

<p>Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,</p>

<p>Can set the Duke up in despite of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,</p>

<p>Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defense.</p>

<p>May that ground gape and swallow me alive</p>

<p>Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.–</p>

<p>What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span> <i>[to King Henry]</i></p>

<p>Do right unto this princely Duke of York,</p>

<p>Or I will fill the house with armed men,</p>

<p>And over the chair of state, where now he sits,</p>

<p>Write up his title with usurping blood.</p>

<p><center><i>[He stamps with his foot,</p>

<p>and the Soldiers show themselves.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>My lord of Warwick, hear but one word:</p>

<p>Let me for this my lifetime reign as king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,</p>

<p>And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>I am content. Richard Plantagenet,</p>

<p>Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>What good is this to England and himself!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmorland</span></p>

<p>Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>How hast thou injured both thyself and us!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmorland</span></p>

<p>I cannot stay to hear these articles.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  Nor I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmorland</span></p>

<p>Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,</p>

<p>In whose cold blood no spark of honor bides.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Be thou a prey unto the house of York,</p>

<p>And die in bands for this unmanly deed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,</p>

<p>Or live in peace abandoned and despised!</p>

<p><center><i>[Westmorland, Northumberland, Clifford,</p>

<p>and their Soldiers exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Ah, Exeter!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span>  Why should you sigh, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,</p>

<p>Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.</p>

<p>But be it as it may. <i>[(To York.)]</i> I here entail</p>

<p>The crown to thee and to thine heirs forever,</p>

<p>Conditionally, that here thou take an oath</p>

<p>To cease this civil war and, whilst I live,</p>

<p>To honor me as thy king and sovereign,</p>

<p>And neither by treason nor hostility</p>

<p>To seek to put me down and reign thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>This oath I willingly take and will perform.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.</p>

<p><center><i>[York stands, and King Henry ascends the dais.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[to York]</i></p>

<p>And long live thou and these thy forward sons!</p>

<p><center><i>[They embrace.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sennet. Here they come down.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span> <i>[to King Henry]</i></p>

<p>Farewell, my gracious lord. I’ll to my castle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>And I’ll keep London with my soldiers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span></p>

<p>And I to Norfolk with my followers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montague</span></p>

<p>And I unto the sea, from whence I came.</p>

<p><center><i>[York, Edward, Richard, Warwick, Norfolk,</p>

<p>Montague, and their Soldiers exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>And I with grief and sorrow to the court.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Queen Margaret, with Prince Edward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her</p>

<p>anger.</p>

<p>I’ll steal away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  Exeter, so will I.</p>

<p><center><i>[They begin to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Nay, go not from me. I will follow thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Who can be patient in such extremes?</p>

<p>Ah, wretched man, would I had died a maid</p>

<p>And never seen thee, never borne thee son,</p>

<p>Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father.</p>

<p>Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?</p>

<p>Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,</p>

<p>Or felt that pain which I did for him once,</p>

<p>Or nourished him as I did with my blood,</p>

<p>Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood</p>

<p>there,</p>

<p>Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir</p>

<p>And disinherited thine only son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Father, you cannot disinherit me.</p>

<p>If you be king, why should not I succeed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Pardon me, Margaret.–Pardon me, sweet son.</p>

<p>The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforced me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Enforced thee? Art thou king and wilt be forced?</p>

<p>I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch,</p>

<p>Thou hast undone thyself, thy son, and me,</p>

<p>And giv’n unto the house of York such head</p>

<p>As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance!</p>

<p>To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,</p>

<p>What is it but to make thy sepulcher</p>

<p>And creep into it far before thy time?</p>

<p>Warwick is Chancellor and the lord of Callice;</p>

<p>Stern Falconbridge commands the Narrow Seas;</p>

<p>The Duke is made Protector of the realm;</p>

<p>And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safety finds</p>

<p>The trembling lamb environed with wolves.</p>

<p>Had I been there, which am a silly woman,</p>

<p>The soldiers should have tossed me on their pikes</p>

<p>Before I would have granted to that act.</p>

<p>But thou preferr’st thy life before thine honor.</p>

<p>And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself</p>

<p>Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,</p>

<p>Until that act of Parliament be repealed</p>

<p>Whereby my son is disinherited.</p>

<p>The northern lords that have forsworn thy colors</p>

<p>Will follow mine if once they see them spread;</p>

<p>And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace</p>

<p>And utter ruin of the house of York.</p>

<p>Thus do I leave thee.–Come, son, let’s away.</p>

<p>Our army is ready. Come, we’ll after them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Thou hast spoke too much already. Get thee gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Ay, to be murdered by his enemies!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>When I return with victory from the field,</p>

<p>I’ll see your Grace. Till then, I’ll follow her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Come, son, away. We may not linger thus.</p>

<p><center><i>[Queen Margaret and Prince Edward exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Poor queen! How love to me and to her son</p>

<p>Hath made her break out into terms of rage!</p>

<p>Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,</p>

<p>Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,</p>

<p>Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle</p>

<p>Tire on the flesh of me and of my son.</p>

<p>The loss of those three lords torments my heart.</p>

<p>I’ll write unto them and entreat them fair.</p>

<p>Come, cousin, you shall be the messenger.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.</p>
