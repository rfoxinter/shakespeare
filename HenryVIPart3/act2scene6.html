<p><center><i>[A loud alarum. Enter Clifford,</p>

<p>wearing the red rose, wounded.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clifford</sc></p>

<p>Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,</p>

<p>Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light.</p>

<p>O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow</p>

<p>More than my body’s parting with my soul!</p>

<p>My love and fear glued many friends to thee;</p>

<p>And now I fall, thy tough commixtures melts,</p>

<p>Impairing Henry, strength’ning misproud York;</p>

<p>And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?</p>

<p>And who shines now but Henry’s enemies?</p>

<p>O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent</p>

<p>That Phaeton should check thy fiery steeds,</p>

<p>Thy burning car never had scorched the Earth!</p>

<p>And Henry, hadst thou swayed as kings should do,</p>

<p>Or as thy father and his father did,</p>

<p>Giving no ground unto the house of York,</p>

<p>They never then had sprung like summer flies;</p>

<p>I and ten thousand in this luckless realm</p>

<p>Had left no mourning widows for our death,</p>

<p>And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.</p>

<p>For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?</p>

<p>And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?</p>

<p>Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;</p>

<p>No way to fly, no strength to hold out flight.</p>

<p>The foe is merciless and will not pity,</p>

<p>For at their hands I have deserved no pity.</p>

<p>The air hath got into my deadly wounds,</p>

<p>And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.</p>

<p>Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest.</p>

<p>I stabbed your fathers’ bosoms; split my breast.</p>

<p><center><i>[He faints.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Alarum and retreat. Enter Edward, Warwick,</p>

<p>Richard, and Soldiers, Montague, and George,</p>

<p>all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Now breathe we, lords. Good fortune bids us pause</p>

<p>And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.</p>

<p>Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen</p>

<p>That led calm Henry, though he were a king,</p>

<p>As doth a sail filled with a fretting gust</p>

<p>Command an argosy to stem the waves.</p>

<p>But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>No, ’tis impossible he should escape,</p>

<p>For, though before his face I speak the words,</p>

<p>Your brother Richard marked him for the grave,</p>

<p>And wheresoe’er he is, he’s surely dead.</p>

<p><center><i>[Clifford groans, and dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?</p>

<p>A deadly groan, like life and death’s departing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>See who it is; and, now the battle’s ended,</p>

<p>If friend or foe, let him be gently used.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Revoke that doom of mercy, for ’tis Clifford,</p>

<p>Who not contented that he lopped the branch</p>

<p>In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,</p>

<p>But set his murd’ring knife unto the root</p>

<p>From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,</p>

<p>I mean our princely father, Duke of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>From off the gates of York fetch down the head,</p>

<p>Your father’s head, which Clifford placed there;</p>

<p>Instead whereof let this supply the room.</p>

<p>Measure for measure must be answered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house</p>

<p>That nothing sung but death to us and ours;</p>

<p>Now death shall stop his dismal threat’ning sound,</p>

<p>And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>I think his understanding is bereft.–</p>

<p>Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to</p>

<p>thee?–</p>

<p>Dark cloudy death o’ershades his beams of life,</p>

<p>And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>O, would he did–and so, perhaps, he doth!</p>

<p>’Tis but his policy to counterfeit,</p>

<p>Because he would avoid such bitter taunts</p>

<p>Which in the time of death he gave our father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>George</sc></p>

<p>If so thou think’st, vex him with eager words.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>George</sc></p>

<p>While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Thou pitied’st Rutland; I will pity thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>George</sc></p>

<p>Where’s Captain Margaret to fence you now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>What, not an oath? Nay, then, the world goes hard</p>

<p>When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.</p>

<p>I know by that he’s dead; and, by my soul,</p>

<p>If this right hand would buy but two hours’ life</p>

<p>That I in all despite might rail at him,</p>

<p>This hand should chop it off, and with the issuing</p>

<p>blood</p>

<p>Stifle the villain whose unstaunched thirst</p>

<p>York and young Rutland could not satisfy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Ay, but he’s dead. Off with the traitor’s head,</p>

<p>And rear it in the place your father’s stands.</p>

<p>And now to London with triumphant march,</p>

<p>There to be crowned England’s royal king,</p>

<p>From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France</p>

<p>And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen;</p>

<p>So shalt thou sinew both these lands together,</p>

<p>And having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread</p>

<p>The scattered foe that hopes to rise again;</p>

<p>For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,</p>

<p>Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.</p>

<p>First will I see the coronation,</p>

<p>And then to Brittany I’ll cross the sea</p>

<p>To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;</p>

<p>For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,</p>

<p>And never will I undertake the thing</p>

<p>Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.–</p>

<p>Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,</p>

<p>And George, of Clarence. Warwick as ourself</p>

<p>Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester,</p>

<p>For Gloucester’s dukedom is too ominous.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Tut, that’s a foolish observation.</p>

<p>Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,</p>

<p>To see these honors in possession.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit, with Clifford’s body.]</i></center></p>
