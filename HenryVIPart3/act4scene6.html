<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King Henry the Sixth, Clarence,</p>

<p>Warwick, Somerset, young Henry Earl of Richmond,</p>

<p>Oxford, Montague, all wearing the red rose,</p>

<p>and Lieutenant of the Tower.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Master lieutenant, now that God and friends</p>

<p>Have shaken Edward from the regal seat</p>

<p>And turned my captive state to liberty,</p>

<p>My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,</p>

<p>At our enlargement what are thy due fees?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lieutenant</span></p>

<p>Subjects may challenge nothing of their sov’reigns,</p>

<p>But, if an humble prayer may prevail,</p>

<p>I then crave pardon of your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>For what, lieutenant? For well using me?</p>

<p>Nay, be thou sure I’ll well requite thy kindness,</p>

<p>For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure,</p>

<p>Ay, such a pleasure as encaged birds</p>

<p>Conceive when, after many moody thoughts,</p>

<p>At last by notes of household harmony</p>

<p>They quite forget their loss of liberty.–</p>

<p>But, Warwick, after God thou sett’st me free,</p>

<p>And chiefly, therefore, I thank God and thee.</p>

<p>He was the author, thou the instrument.</p>

<p>Therefore, that I may conquer Fortune’s spite</p>

<p>By living low where Fortune cannot hurt me,</p>

<p>And that the people of this blessed land</p>

<p>May not be punished with my thwarting stars,</p>

<p>Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,</p>

<p>I here resign my government to thee,</p>

<p>For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Your Grace hath still been famed for virtuous</p>

<p>And now may seem as wise as virtuous</p>

<p>By spying and avoiding Fortune’s malice,</p>

<p>For few men rightly temper with the stars.</p>

<p>Yet, in this one thing let me blame your Grace:</p>

<p>For choosing me when Clarence is in place.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,</p>

<p>To whom the heav’ns in thy nativity</p>

<p>Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown</p>

<p>As likely to be blest in peace and war;</p>

<p>And therefore I yield thee my free consent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>And I choose Clarence only for Protector.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands.</p>

<p>Now join your hands, and with your hands your</p>

<p>hearts,</p>

<p>That no dissension hinder government.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[He joins their hands.]</i></center></p>

<p>I make you both Protectors of this land,</p>

<p>While I myself will lead a private life</p>

<p>And in devotion spend my latter days,</p>

<p>To sin’s rebuke and my Creator’s praise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>What answers Clarence to his sovereign’s will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>That he consents, if Warwick yield consent,</p>

<p>For on thy fortune I repose myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content.</p>

<p>We’ll yoke together like a double shadow</p>

<p>To Henry’s body, and supply his place–</p>

<p>I mean, in bearing weight of government–</p>

<p>While he enjoys the honor and his ease.</p>

<p>And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful</p>

<p>Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor</p>

<p>And all his lands and goods be confiscate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>What else? And that succession be determined.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>But with the first of all your chief affairs</p>

<p>Let me entreat–for I command no more–</p>

<p>That Margaret your queen and my son Edward</p>

<p>Be sent for, to return from France with speed,</p>

<p>For till I see them here, by doubtful fear</p>

<p>My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>My lord of Somerset, what youth is that</p>

<p>Of whom you seem to have so tender care?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[to Richmond]</i></p>

<p>Come hither, England’s hope.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lays his hand on Richmond’s head.]</i></center></p>

<p>If secret powers</p>

<p>Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,</p>

<p>This pretty lad will prove our country’s bliss.</p>

<p>His looks are full of peaceful majesty,</p>

<p>His head by nature framed to wear a crown,</p>

<p>His hand to wield a scepter, and himself</p>

<p>Likely in time to bless a regal throne.</p>

<p>Make much of him, my lords, for this is he</p>

<p>Must help you more than you are hurt by me.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Post.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span>  What news, my friend?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Post</span></p>

<p>That Edward is escaped from your brother</p>

<p>And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Unsavory news! But how made he escape?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Post</span></p>

<p>He was conveyed by Richard, Duke of Gloucester,</p>

<p>And the Lord Hastings, who attended him</p>

<p>In secret ambush on the forest side</p>

<p>And from the Bishop’s huntsmen rescued him,</p>

<p>For hunting was his daily exercise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>My brother was too careless of his charge.</p>

<p>But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide</p>

<p>A salve for any sore that may betide.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Somerset, Richmond, and Oxford exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span> <i>[to Oxford]</i></p>

<p>My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward’s,</p>

<p>For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,</p>

<p>And we shall have more wars before ’t be long.</p>

<p>As Henry’s late presaging prophecy</p>

<p>Did glad my heart with hope of this young</p>

<p>Richmond,</p>

<p>So doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts</p>

<p>What may befall him, to his harm and ours.</p>

<p>Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,</p>

<p>Forthwith we’ll send him hence to Brittany</p>

<p>Till storms be past of civil enmity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oxford</span></p>

<p>Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,</p>

<p>’Tis like that Richmond, with the rest, shall down.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>It shall be so. He shall to Brittany.</p>

<p>Come, therefore, let’s about it speedily.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
