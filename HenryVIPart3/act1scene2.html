<p><center><i>[Enter Richard, Edward, and Montague,</p>

<p>all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>No, I can better play the orator.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montague</span></p>

<p>But I have reasons strong and forcible.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Duke of York.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Why, how now, sons and brother, at a strife?</p>

<p>What is your quarrel? How began it first?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>No quarrel, but a slight contention.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  About what?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>About that which concerns your Grace and us:</p>

<p>The crown of England, father, which is yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Your right depends not on his life or death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Now you are heir; therefore enjoy it now.</p>

<p>By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,</p>

<p>It will outrun you, father, in the end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>I took an oath that he should quietly reign.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>But for a kingdom any oath may be broken.</p>

<p>I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>No, God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>I shall be, if I claim by open war.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>I’ll prove the contrary, if you’ll hear me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>An oath is of no moment, being not took</p>

<p>Before a true and lawful magistrate</p>

<p>That hath authority over him that swears.</p>

<p>Henry had none, but did usurp the place.</p>

<p>Then, seeing ’twas he that made you to depose,</p>

<p>Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.</p>

<p>Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think</p>

<p>How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown,</p>

<p>Within whose circuit is Elysium</p>

<p>And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.</p>

<p>Why do we linger thus? I cannot rest</p>

<p>Until the white rose that I wear be dyed</p>

<p>Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry’s heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Richard, enough. I will be king or die.–</p>

<p>Brother, thou shalt to London presently,</p>

<p>And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.–</p>

<p>Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk</p>

<p>And tell him privily of our intent.–</p>

<p>You, Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,</p>

<p>With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise;</p>

<p>In them I trust, for they are soldiers</p>

<p>Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.</p>

<p>While you are thus employed, what resteth more</p>

<p>But that I seek occasion how to rise,</p>

<p>And yet the King not privy to my drift,</p>

<p>Nor any of the house of Lancaster.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But stay, what news? Why com’st thou in such post?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>The Queen with all the northern earls and lords</p>

<p>Intend here to besiege you in your castle.</p>

<p>She is hard by with twenty thousand men.</p>

<p>And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Ay, with my sword. What, think’st thou that we fear</p>

<p>them?–</p>

<p>Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;</p>

<p>My brother Montague shall post to London.</p>

<p>Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,</p>

<p>Whom we have left Protectors of the King,</p>

<p>With powerful policy strengthen themselves</p>

<p>And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montague</span></p>

<p>Brother, I go. I’ll win them, fear it not.</p>

<p>And thus most humbly I do take my leave.</p>

<p><center><i>[Montague exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Mortimer, and his brother,</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Mortimer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,</p>

<p>You are come to Sandal in a happy hour.</p>

<p>The army of the Queen mean to besiege us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sir</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>She shall not need; we’ll meet her in the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  What, with five thousand men?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need.</p>

<p>A woman’s general; what should we fear?</p>

<p><center><i>[A march afar off.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>I hear their drums. Let’s set our men in order,</p>

<p>And issue forth and bid them battle straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Five men to twenty: though the odds be great,</p>

<p>I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.</p>

<p>Many a battle have I won in France</p>

<p>Whenas the enemy hath been ten to one.</p>

<p>Why should I not now have the like success?</p>

<p><center><i>[Alarum. They exit.]</i></center></p>
