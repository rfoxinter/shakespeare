<p><center><i>[Enter King Henry the Sixth, wearing the red rose,</p>

<p>and Richard of Gloucester, wearing the white rose,</p>

<p>with the Lieutenant above on the Tower walls.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord–“my lord,” I should say rather.</p>

<p>’Tis sin to flatter; “good” was little better:</p>

<p>“Good Gloucester” and “good devil” were alike,</p>

<p>And both preposterous: therefore, not “good lord.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[to Lieutenant]</i></p>

<p>Sirrah, leave us to ourselves; we must confer.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lieutenant exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;</p>

<p>So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece</p>

<p>And next his throat unto the butcher’s knife.</p>

<p>What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;</p>

<p>The thief doth fear each bush an officer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>The bird that hath been limed in a bush,</p>

<p>With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;</p>

<p>And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,</p>

<p>Have now the fatal object in my eye</p>

<p>Where my poor young was limed, was caught, and</p>

<p>killed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete</p>

<p>That taught his son the office of a fowl!</p>

<p>And yet, for all his wings, the fool was drowned.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>I Daedalus, my poor boy Icarus,</p>

<p>Thy father Minos, that denied our course;</p>

<p>The sun that seared the wings of my sweet boy</p>

<p>Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea</p>

<p>Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.</p>

<p>Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!</p>

<p>My breast can better brook thy dagger’s point</p>

<p>Than can my ears that tragic history.</p>

<p>But wherefore dost thou come? Is ’t for my life?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Think’st thou I am an executioner?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>A persecutor I am sure thou art.</p>

<p>If murdering innocents be executing,</p>

<p>Why, then, thou art an executioner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Thy son I killed for his presumption.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Hadst thou been killed when first thou didst presume,</p>

<p>Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.</p>

<p>And thus I prophesy: that many a thousand</p>

<p>Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,</p>

<p>And many an old man’s sigh, and many a widow’s</p>

<p>And many an orphan’s water-standing eye,</p>

<p>Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,</p>

<p>Orphans for their parents’ timeless death,</p>

<p>Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.</p>

<p>The owl shrieked at thy birth, an evil sign;</p>

<p>The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;</p>

<p>Dogs howled, and hideous tempest shook down trees;</p>

<p>The raven rooked her on the chimney’s top;</p>

<p>And chatt’ring pies in dismal discords sung;</p>

<p>Thy mother felt more than a mother’s pain,</p>

<p>And yet brought forth less than a mother’s hope:</p>

<p>To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,</p>

<p>Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.</p>

<p>Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born</p>

<p>To signify thou cam’st to bite the world.</p>

<p>And if the rest be true which I have heard,</p>

<p>Thou cam’st–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>I’ll hear no more. Die, prophet, in thy speech;</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Stabs him.]</i></center></p>

<p>For this amongst the rest was I ordained.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.</p>

<p>O God, forgive my sins, and pardon thee.     <i><i>[Dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster</p>

<p>Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.</p>

<p>See how my sword weeps for the poor king’s death.</p>

<p>O, may such purple tears be always shed</p>

<p>From those that wish the downfall of our house.</p>

<p>If any spark of life be yet remaining,</p>

<p>Down, down to hell, and say I sent thee thither–</p>

<p><center><i>[Stabs him again.]</i></center></p>

<p>I that have neither pity, love, nor fear.</p>

<p>Indeed, ’tis true that Henry told me of,</p>

<p>For I have often heard my mother say</p>

<p>I came into the world with my legs forward.</p>

<p>Had I not reason, think you, to make haste</p>

<p>And seek their ruin that usurped our right?</p>

<p>The midwife wondered, and the women cried</p>

<p>“O Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!”</p>

<p>And so I was, which plainly signified</p>

<p>That I should snarl, and bite, and play the dog.</p>

<p>Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,</p>

<p>Let hell make crook’d my mind to answer it.</p>

<p>I have no brother, I am like no brother;</p>

<p>And this word “love,” which graybeards call divine,</p>

<p>Be resident in men like one another</p>

<p>And not in me. I am myself alone.</p>

<p>Clarence, beware; thou keep’st me from the light,</p>

<p>But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;</p>

<p>For I will buzz abroad such prophecies</p>

<p>That Edward shall be fearful of his life;</p>

<p>And then to purge his fear, I’ll be thy death.</p>

<p>King Henry and the Prince his son are gone.</p>

<p>Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,</p>

<p>Counting myself but bad till I be best.</p>

<p>I’ll throw thy body in another room,</p>

<p>And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits, carrying out the body.]</i></center></p>
