<p><center><i>[Enter King Edward, Richard, Duke of Gloucester,</p>

<p>George, Duke of Clarence, Lady Grey,</p>

<p>and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Albans field</p>

<p>This lady’s husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,</p>

<p>His land then seized on by the conqueror.</p>

<p>Her suit is now to repossess those lands,</p>

<p>Which we in justice cannot well deny,</p>

<p>Because in quarrel of the house of York</p>

<p>The worthy gentleman did lose his life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit;</p>

<p>It were dishonor to deny it her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>It were no less, but yet I’ll make a pause.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside to Clarence]</i>  Yea, is it so?</p>

<p>I see the lady hath a thing to grant</p>

<p>Before the King will grant her humble suit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span> <i>[formerly <span class='sc'>George</span> aside to Richard]</i></p>

<p>He knows the game; how true he keeps the wind!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside to Clarence]</i>  Silence!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Widow, we will consider of your suit,</p>

<p>And come some other time to know our mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay.</p>

<p>May it please your Highness to resolve me now,</p>

<p>And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside to Clarence]</i></p>

<p>Ay, widow? Then I’ll warrant you all your lands,</p>

<p>An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.</p>

<p>Fight closer, or, good faith, you’ll catch a blow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span> <i>[aside to Richard]</i></p>

<p>I fear her not, unless she chance to fall.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside to Clarence]</i></p>

<p>God forbid that, for he’ll take vantages.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>How many children hast thou, widow? Tell me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span> <i>[aside to Richard]</i></p>

<p>I think he means to beg a child of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside to Clarence]</i></p>

<p>Nay, then, whip me; he’ll rather give her two.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span>  Three, my most gracious lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside to Clarence]</i></p>

<p>You shall have four if you’ll be ruled by him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>’Twere pity they should lose their father’s lands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Lords, give us leave. I’ll try this widow’s wit.</p>

<p><center><i>[Richard and Clarence stand aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside to Clarence]</i></p>

<p>Ay, good leave have you, for you will have leave</p>

<p>Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>And would you not do much to do them good?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>To do them good I would sustain some harm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Then get your husband’s lands to do them good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>Therefore I came unto your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>I’ll tell you how these lands are to be got.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>So shall you bind me to your Highness’ service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>What service wilt thou do me if I give them?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>What you command that rests in me to do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>But you will take exceptions to my boon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>Why, then, I will do what your Grace commands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside to Clarence]</i></p>

<p>He plies her hard, and much rain wears the marble.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span> <i>[aside to Richard]</i></p>

<p>As red as fire! Nay, then, her wax must melt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>An easy task; ’tis but to love a king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>That’s soon performed because I am a subject.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Why, then, thy husband’s lands I freely give thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>I take my leave with many thousand thanks.</p>

<p><center><i>[She curtsies and begins to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside to Clarence]</i></p>

<p>The match is made; she seals it with a cursy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>But stay thee; ’tis the fruits of love I mean.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.</p>

<p>What love, think’st thou, I sue so much to get?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers,</p>

<p>That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>Why, then, you mean not as I thought you did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>But now you partly may perceive my mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>My mind will never grant what I perceive</p>

<p>Your Highness aims at, if I aim aright.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Why, then, thou shalt not have thy husband’s lands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>Why, then, mine honesty shall be my dower,</p>

<p>For by that loss I will not purchase them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Therein thou wrong’st thy children mightily.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me.</p>

<p>But, mighty lord, this merry inclination</p>

<p>Accords not with the sadness of my suit.</p>

<p>Please you dismiss me either with ay or no.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Ay, if thou wilt say “ay” to my request;</p>

<p>No, if thou dost say “no” to my demand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>Then no, my lord; my suit is at an end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside to Clarence]</i></p>

<p>The widow likes him not; she knits her brows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span> <i>[aside to Richard]</i></p>

<p>He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty;</p>

<p>Her words doth show her wit incomparable;</p>

<p>All her perfections challenge sovereignty.</p>

<p>One way or other, she is for a king,</p>

<p>And she shall be my love or else my queen.–</p>

<p>Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>’Tis better said than done, my gracious lord.</p>

<p>I am a subject fit to jest withal,</p>

<p>But far unfit to be a sovereign.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee</p>

<p>I speak no more than what my soul intends,</p>

<p>And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>And that is more than I will yield unto.</p>

<p>I know I am too mean to be your queen</p>

<p>And yet too good to be your concubine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>You cavil, widow; I did mean my queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Grey</span></p>

<p>’Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you</p>

<p>father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>No more than when my daughters call thee mother.</p>

<p>Thou art a widow and thou hast some children,</p>

<p>And, by God’s mother, I, being but a bachelor,</p>

<p>Have other some. Why, ’tis a happy thing</p>

<p>To be the father unto many sons.</p>

<p>Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside to Clarence]</i></p>

<p>The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span> <i>[aside to Richard]</i></p>

<p>When he was made a shriver, ’twas for shift.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>You’d think it strange if I should marry her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>To who, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span>  Why, Clarence, to myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>That would be ten days’ wonder at the least.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>That’s a day longer than a wonder lasts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>By so much is the wonder in extremes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Well, jest on, brothers. I can tell you both</p>

<p>Her suit is granted for her husband’s lands.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Nobleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nobleman</span></p>

<p>My gracious lord, Henry, your foe, is taken</p>

<p>And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>See that he be conveyed unto the Tower.</p>

<p><center><i>[Nobleman exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,</p>

<p>To question of his apprehension.–</p>

<p>Widow, go you along.–Lords, use her honorably.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.</p>

<p>Richard remains.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Ay, Edward will use women honorably!</p>

<p>Would he were wasted–marrow, bones, and all–</p>

<p>That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring</p>

<p>To cross me from the golden time I look for.</p>

<p>And yet, between my soul’s desire and me,</p>

<p>The lustful Edward’s title buried,</p>

<p>Is Clarence, Henry, and his son, young Edward,</p>

<p>And all the unlooked-for issue of their bodies</p>

<p>To take their rooms ere I can place myself.</p>

<p>A cold premeditation for my purpose.</p>

<p>Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty</p>

<p>Like one that stands upon a promontory</p>

<p>And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,</p>

<p>Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,</p>

<p>And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,</p>

<p>Saying he’ll lade it dry to have his way.</p>

<p>So do I wish the crown, being so far off,</p>

<p>And so I chide the means that keeps me from it,</p>

<p>And so, I say, I’ll cut the causes off,</p>

<p>Flattering me with impossibilities.</p>

<p>My eye’s too quick, my heart o’erweens too much,</p>

<p>Unless my hand and strength could equal them.</p>

<p>Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard,</p>

<p>What other pleasure can the world afford?</p>

<p>I’ll make my heaven in a lady’s lap</p>

<p>And deck my body in gay ornaments,</p>

<p>And ’witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.</p>

<p>O miserable thought, and more unlikely</p>

<p>Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!</p>

<p>Why, Love forswore me in my mother’s womb,</p>

<p>And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,</p>

<p>She did corrupt frail Nature with some bribe</p>

<p>To shrink mine arm up like a withered shrub;</p>

<p>To make an envious mountain on my back,</p>

<p>Where sits Deformity to mock my body;</p>

<p>To shape my legs of an unequal size;</p>

<p>To disproportion me in every part,</p>

<p>Like to a chaos, or an unlicked bear-whelp,</p>

<p>That carries no impression like the dam.</p>

<p>And am I then a man to be beloved?</p>

<p>O monstrous fault to harbor such a thought!</p>

<p>Then, since this Earth affords no joy to me</p>

<p>But to command, to check, to o’erbear such</p>

<p>As are of better person than myself,</p>

<p>I’ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,</p>

<p>And, whiles I live, t’ account this world but hell</p>

<p>Until my misshaped trunk that bears this head</p>

<p>Be round impaled with a glorious crown.</p>

<p>And yet I know not how to get the crown,</p>

<p>For many lives stand between me and home;</p>

<p>And I, like one lost in a thorny wood,</p>

<p>That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns,</p>

<p>Seeking a way and straying from the way,</p>

<p>Not knowing how to find the open air,</p>

<p>But toiling desperately to find it out,</p>

<p>Torment myself to catch the English crown.</p>

<p>And from that torment I will free myself</p>

<p>Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.</p>

<p>Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,</p>

<p>And cry “Content” to that which grieves my heart,</p>

<p>And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,</p>

<p>And frame my face to all occasions.</p>

<p>I’ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;</p>

<p>I’ll slay more gazers than the basilisk;</p>

<p>I’ll play the orator as well as Nestor,</p>

<p>Deceive more slyly than Ulysses could,</p>

<p>And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.</p>

<p>I can add colors to the chameleon,</p>

<p>Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,</p>

<p>And set the murderous Machiavel to school.</p>

<p>Can I do this and cannot get a crown?</p>

<p>Tut, were it farther off, I’ll pluck it down.</p>
