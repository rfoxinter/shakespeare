<p><center><i>[Enter Richard of Gloucester, Clarence, Somerset,</p>

<p>and Montague, all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you</p>

<p>Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?</p>

<p>Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Alas, you know ’tis far from hence to France.</p>

<p>How could he stay till Warwick made return?</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>My lords, forbear this talk. Here comes the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  And his well-chosen bride.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>I mind to tell him plainly what I think.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King Edward, with Attendants,</p>

<p>Lady Grey, now Queen Elizabeth, Pembroke, Stafford,</p>

<p>Hastings, and others, all wearing the white rose.</p>

<p>Four stand on one side, and four on the other.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,</p>

<p>That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,</p>

<p>Which are so weak of courage and in judgment</p>

<p>That they’ll take no offense at our abuse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Suppose they take offense without a cause,</p>

<p>They are but Lewis and Warwick; I am Edward,</p>

<p>Your king and Warwick’s, and must have my will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>And shall have your will because our king.</p>

<p>Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Not I.</p>

<p>No, God forbid that I should wish them severed</p>

<p>Whom God hath joined together. Ay, and ’twere pity</p>

<p>To sunder them that yoke so well together.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,</p>

<p>Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey</p>

<p>Should not become my wife and England’s queen?</p>

<p>And you too, Somerset and Montague,</p>

<p>Speak freely what you think.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis</p>

<p>Becomes your enemy for mocking him</p>

<p>About the marriage of the Lady Bona.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,</p>

<p>Is now dishonored by this new marriage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased</p>

<p>By such invention as I can devise?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montague</span></p>

<p>Yet to have joined with France in such alliance</p>

<p>Would more have strengthened this our</p>

<p>commonwealth</p>

<p>’Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Why, knows not Montague that of itself</p>

<p>England is safe, if true within itself?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montague</span></p>

<p>But the safer when ’tis backed with France.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>’Tis better using France than trusting France.</p>

<p>Let us be backed with God and with the seas</p>

<p>Which He hath giv’n for fence impregnable,</p>

<p>And with their helps only defend ourselves.</p>

<p>In them and in ourselves our safety lies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>For this one speech, Lord Hastings well deserves</p>

<p>To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Ay, what of that? It was my will and grant,</p>

<p>And for this once my will shall stand for law.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well</p>

<p>To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales</p>

<p>Unto the brother of your loving bride.</p>

<p>She better would have fitted me or Clarence;</p>

<p>But in your bride you bury brotherhood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Or else you would not have bestowed the heir</p>

<p>Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife’s son,</p>

<p>And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Alas, poor Clarence, is it for a wife</p>

<p>That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>In choosing for yourself you showed your judgment,</p>

<p>Which, being shallow, you shall give me leave</p>

<p>To play the broker in mine own behalf.</p>

<p>And to that end, I shortly mind to leave you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Leave me or tarry, Edward will be king</p>

<p>And not be tied unto his brother’s will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span></p>

<p>My lords, before it pleased his Majesty</p>

<p>To raise my state to title of a queen,</p>

<p>Do me but right and you must all confess</p>

<p>That I was not ignoble of descent,</p>

<p>And meaner than myself have had like fortune.</p>

<p>But as this title honors me and mine,</p>

<p>So your dislikes, to whom I would be pleasing,</p>

<p>Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.</p>

<p>What danger or what sorrow can befall thee</p>

<p>So long as Edward is thy constant friend</p>

<p>And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?</p>

<p>Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,</p>

<p>Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;</p>

<p>Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,</p>

<p>And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Post.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Now, messenger, what letters or what news from</p>

<p>France?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Post</span></p>

<p>My sovereign liege, no letters and few words</p>

<p>But such as I without your special pardon</p>

<p>Dare not relate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Go to, we pardon thee. Therefore, in brief,</p>

<p>Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.</p>

<p>What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Post</span></p>

<p>At my depart, these were his very words:</p>

<p>“Go tell false Edward, the supposed king,</p>

<p>That Lewis of France is sending over maskers</p>

<p>To revel it with him and his new bride.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Is Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry.</p>

<p>But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Post</span></p>

<p>These were her words, uttered with mild disdain:</p>

<p>“Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly,</p>

<p>I’ll wear the willow garland for his sake.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>I blame not her; she could say little less;</p>

<p>She had the wrong. But what said Henry’s queen?</p>

<p>For I have heard that she was there in place.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Post</span></p>

<p>“Tell him,” quoth she, “my mourning weeds are</p>

<p>done,</p>

<p>And I am ready to put armor on.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Belike she minds to play the Amazon.</p>

<p>But what said Warwick to these injuries?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Post</span></p>

<p>He, more incensed against your Majesty</p>

<p>Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:</p>

<p>“Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</p>

<p>And therefore I’ll uncrown him ere ’t be long.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Ha! Durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?</p>

<p>Well, I will arm me, being thus forewarned.</p>

<p>They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.</p>

<p>But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Post</span></p>

<p>Ay, gracious sovereign, they are so linked in</p>

<p>friendship</p>

<p>That young Prince Edward marries Warwick’s</p>

<p>daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.–</p>

<p>Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,</p>

<p>For I will hence to Warwick’s other daughter,</p>

<p>That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage</p>

<p>I may not prove inferior to yourself.</p>

<p>You that love me and Warwick, follow me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Clarence exits, and Somerset follows.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Not I. My thoughts aim at a further matter:</p>

<p>I stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick?</p>

<p>Yet am I armed against the worst can happen,</p>

<p>And haste is needful in this desp’rate case.</p>

<p>Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf</p>

<p>Go levy men and make prepare for war.</p>

<p>They are already, or quickly will be, landed.</p>

<p>Myself in person will straight follow you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Pembroke and Stafford exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>But ere I go, Hastings and Montague,</p>

<p>Resolve my doubt: you twain, of all the rest,</p>

<p>Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance.</p>

<p>Tell me if you love Warwick more than me.</p>

<p>If it be so, then both depart to him.</p>

<p>I rather wish you foes than hollow friends.</p>

<p>But if you mind to hold your true obedience,</p>

<p>Give me assurance with some friendly vow,</p>

<p>That I may never have you in suspect.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montague</span></p>

<p>So God help Montague as he proves true!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>And Hastings as he favors Edward’s cause!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Why, so. Then am I sure of victory.</p>

<p>Now therefore let us hence and lose no hour</p>

<p>Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.</p>
