<p><center><i>[Alarum. Enter King Henry alone, wearing the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>This battle fares like to the morning’s war,</p>

<p>When dying clouds contend with growing light,</p>

<p>What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,</p>

<p>Can neither call it perfect day nor night.</p>

<p>Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea</p>

<p>Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;</p>

<p>Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea</p>

<p>Forced to retire by fury of the wind.</p>

<p>Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;</p>

<p>Now one the better, then another best,</p>

<p>Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,</p>

<p>Yet neither conqueror nor conquered.</p>

<p>So is the equal poise of this fell war.</p>

<p>Here on this molehill will I sit me down.</p>

<p><center><i>[He sits on a small prominence.]</i></center></p>

<p>To whom God will, there be the victory;</p>

<p>For Margaret my queen and Clifford too</p>

<p>Have chid me from the battle, swearing both</p>

<p>They prosper best of all when I am thence.</p>

<p>Would I were dead, if God’s good will were so,</p>

<p>For what is in this world but grief and woe?</p>

<p>O God! Methinks it were a happy life</p>

<p>To be no better than a homely swain,</p>

<p>To sit upon a hill as I do now,</p>

<p>To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,</p>

<p>Thereby to see the minutes how they run:</p>

<p>How many makes the hour full complete,</p>

<p>How many hours brings about the day,</p>

<p>How many days will finish up the year,</p>

<p>How many years a mortal man may live.</p>

<p>When this is known, then to divide the times:</p>

<p>So many hours must I tend my flock,</p>

<p>So many hours must I take my rest,</p>

<p>So many hours must I contemplate,</p>

<p>So many hours must I sport myself,</p>

<p>So many days my ewes have been with young,</p>

<p>So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean,</p>

<p>So many years ere I shall shear the fleece;</p>

<p>So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,</p>

<p>Passed over to the end they were created,</p>

<p>Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.</p>

<p>Ah, what a life were this! How sweet, how lovely!</p>

<p>Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade</p>

<p>To shepherds looking on their silly sheep</p>

<p>Than doth a rich embroidered canopy</p>

<p>To kings that fear their subjects’ treachery?</p>

<p>O yes, it doth, a thousandfold it doth.</p>

<p>And to conclude, the shepherd’s homely curds,</p>

<p>His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,</p>

<p>His wonted sleep under a fresh tree’s shade,</p>

<p>All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,</p>

<p>Is far beyond a prince’s delicates–</p>

<p>His viands sparkling in a golden cup,</p>

<p>His body couched in a curious bed–</p>

<p>When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Alarum. Enter at one door a Son that hath killed his</p>

<p>Father, carrying the body.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Son</span></p>

<p>Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.</p>

<p>This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,</p>

<p>May be possessed with some store of crowns,</p>

<p>And I, that haply take them from him now,</p>

<p>May yet ere night yield both my life and them</p>

<p>To some man else, as this dead man doth me.</p>

<p>Who’s this? O God! It is my father’s face,</p>

<p>Whom in this conflict I unwares have killed.</p>

<p>O heavy times, begetting such events!</p>

<p>From London by the King was I pressed forth.</p>

<p>My father, being the Earl of Warwick’s man,</p>

<p>Came on the part of York, pressed by his master.</p>

<p>And I, who at his hands received my life,</p>

<p>Have by my hands of life bereaved him.</p>

<p>Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did;</p>

<p>And pardon, father, for I knew not thee.</p>

<p>My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks,</p>

<p>And no more words till they have flowed their fill.</p>

<p><center><i>[He weeps.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!</p>

<p>Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,</p>

<p>Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.</p>

<p>Weep, wretched man. I’ll aid thee tear for tear,</p>

<p>And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,</p>

<p>Be blind with tears and break, o’ercharged with grief.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter at another door a Father that hath killed his Son,</p>

<p>bearing of his Son’s body.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Father</span></p>

<p>Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me,</p>

<p>Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold,</p>

<p>For I have bought it with an hundred blows.</p>

<p>But let me see: is this our foeman’s face?</p>

<p>Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!</p>

<p>Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,</p>

<p>Throw up thine eye! See, see, what showers arise,</p>

<p>Blown with the windy tempest of my heart</p>

<p>Upon thy wounds, that kills mine eye and heart!</p>

<p>O, pity God this miserable age!</p>

<p>What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,</p>

<p>Erroneous, mutinous, and unnatural</p>

<p>This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!</p>

<p>O, boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,</p>

<p>And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Woe above woe, grief more than common grief!</p>

<p>O, that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!</p>

<p>O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!</p>

<p>The red rose and the white are on his face,</p>

<p>The fatal colors of our striving houses;</p>

<p>The one his purple blood right well resembles,</p>

<p>The other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth.</p>

<p>Wither one rose and let the other flourish;</p>

<p>If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Son</span></p>

<p>How will my mother for a father’s death</p>

<p>Take on with me and ne’er be satisfied!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Father</span></p>

<p>How will my wife for slaughter of my son</p>

<p>Shed seas of tears and ne’er be satisfied!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>How will the country for these woeful chances</p>

<p>Misthink the King and not be satisfied!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Son</span></p>

<p>Was ever son so rued a father’s death?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Father</span></p>

<p>Was ever father so bemoaned his son?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Was ever king so grieved for subjects’ woe?</p>

<p>Much is your sorrow, mine ten times so much.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Son</span></p>

<p>I’ll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits, bearing the body.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Father</span></p>

<p>These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;</p>

<p>My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulcher,</p>

<p>For from my heart thine image ne’er shall go.</p>

<p>My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;</p>

<p>And so obsequious will thy father be</p>

<p>E’en for the loss of thee, having no more,</p>

<p>As Priam was for all his valiant sons.</p>

<p>I’ll bear thee hence, and let them fight that will,</p>

<p>For I have murdered where I should not kill.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits, bearing the body.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,</p>

<p>Here sits a king more woeful than you are.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Alarums. Excursions. Enter Queen Margaret, Prince</p>

<p>Edward, and Exeter, all wearing the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Fly, father, fly, for all your friends are fled,</p>

<p>And Warwick rages like a chafed bull.</p>

<p>Away, for Death doth hold us in pursuit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain.</p>

<p>Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds</p>

<p>Having the fearful flying hare in sight,</p>

<p>With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath</p>

<p>And bloody steel grasped in their ireful hands,</p>

<p>Are at our backs, and therefore hence amain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>Away, for Vengeance comes along with them.</p>

<p>Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;</p>

<p>Or else come after; I’ll away before.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter;</p>

<p>Not that I fear to stay, but love to go</p>

<p>Whither the Queen intends. Forward, away!</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
