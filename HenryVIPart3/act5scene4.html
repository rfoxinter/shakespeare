<p><center><i>[Flourish. March. Enter Queen Margaret,</p>

<p>young Prince Edward, Somerset, Oxford,</p>

<p>and Soldiers, all wearing the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Great lords, wise men ne’er sit and wail their loss</p>

<p>But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.</p>

<p>What though the mast be now blown overboard,</p>

<p>The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,</p>

<p>And half our sailors swallowed in the flood?</p>

<p>Yet lives our pilot still. Is ’t meet that he</p>

<p>Should leave the helm and, like a fearful lad,</p>

<p>With tearful eyes add water to the sea</p>

<p>And give more strength to that which hath too much,</p>

<p>Whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock,</p>

<p>Which industry and courage might have saved?</p>

<p>Ah, what a shame, ah, what a fault were this!</p>

<p>Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?</p>

<p>And Montague our topmast; what of him?</p>

<p>Our slaughtered friends the tackles; what of these?</p>

<p>Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?</p>

<p>And Somerset another goodly mast?</p>

<p>The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?</p>

<p>And, though unskillful, why not Ned and I</p>

<p>For once allowed the skillful pilot’s charge?</p>

<p>We will not from the helm to sit and weep,</p>

<p>But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,</p>

<p>From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wrack.</p>

<p>As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.</p>

<p>And what is Edward but a ruthless sea?</p>

<p>What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?</p>

<p>And Richard but a ragged fatal rock–</p>

<p>All these the enemies to our poor bark?</p>

<p>Say you can swim: alas, ’tis but awhile;</p>

<p>Tread on the sand: why, there you quickly sink;</p>

<p>Bestride the rock: the tide will wash you off</p>

<p>Or else you famish; that’s a threefold death.</p>

<p>This speak I, lords, to let you understand,</p>

<p>If case some one of you would fly from us,</p>

<p>That there’s no hoped-for mercy with the brothers</p>

<p>More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.</p>

<p>Why, courage then! What cannot be avoided</p>

<p>’Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit</p>

<p>Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,</p>

<p>Infuse his breast with magnanimity</p>

<p>And make him, naked, foil a man-at-arms.</p>

<p>I speak not this as doubting any here,</p>

<p>For did I but suspect a fearful man,</p>

<p>He should have leave to go away betimes,</p>

<p>Lest in our need he might infect another</p>

<p>And make him of like spirit to himself.</p>

<p>If any such be here, as God forbid,</p>

<p>Let him depart before we need his help.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oxford</span></p>

<p>Women and children of so high a courage,</p>

<p>And warriors faint? Why, ’twere perpetual shame!</p>

<p>O, brave young prince, thy famous grandfather</p>

<p>Doth live again in thee. Long mayst thou live</p>

<p>To bear his image and renew his glories!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>And he that will not fight for such a hope,</p>

<p>Go home to bed and, like the owl by day,</p>

<p>If he arise, be mocked and wondered at.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Thanks, gentle Somerset.–Sweet Oxford, thanks.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand,</p>

<p>Ready to fight. Therefore be resolute.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oxford</span></p>

<p>I thought no less. It is his policy</p>

<p>To haste thus fast to find us unprovided.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>But he’s deceived. We are in readiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>This cheers my heart to see your forwardness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oxford</span></p>

<p>Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Flourish, and march. Enter King Edward, Richard,</p>

<p>Clarence, and Soldiers, all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span> <i>[to his army]</i></p>

<p>Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood</p>

<p>Which by the heavens’ assistance and your strength</p>

<p>Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.</p>

<p>I need not add more fuel to your fire,</p>

<p>For, well I wot, you blaze to burn them out.</p>

<p>Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[to her army]</i></p>

<p>Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say</p>

<p>My tears gainsay, for every word I speak</p>

<p>You see I drink the water of my eye.</p>

<p>Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,</p>

<p>Is prisoner to the foe, his state usurped,</p>

<p>His realm a slaughterhouse, his subjects slain,</p>

<p>His statutes cancelled and his treasure spent,</p>

<p>And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.</p>

<p>You fight in justice. Then, in God’s name, lords,</p>

<p>Be valiant, and give signal to the fight!</p>

<p><center><i>[Alarum, retreat, excursions. They exit.]</i></center></p>
