<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter Lewis the French king, his sister</p>

<p>the Lady Bona, his Admiral called Bourbon,</p>

<p>Prince Edward, Queen Margaret, and the Earl of Oxford,</p>

<p>the last three wearing the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Lewis sits, and riseth up again.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,</p>

<p>Sit down with us. It ill befits thy state</p>

<p>And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis</p>

<p>doth sit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret</p>

<p>Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve</p>

<p>Where kings command. I was, I must confess,</p>

<p>Great Albion’s queen in former golden days,</p>

<p>But now mischance hath trod my title down</p>

<p>And with dishonor laid me on the ground,</p>

<p>Where I must take like seat unto my fortune</p>

<p>And to my humble seat conform myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep</p>

<p>despair?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears</p>

<p>And stops my tongue, while heart is drowned in cares.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Whate’er it be, be thou still like thyself,</p>

<p>And sit thee by our side.     <i><i>[Seats her by him.]</i></i></p>

<p>Yield not thy neck</p>

<p>To Fortune’s yoke, but let thy dauntless mind</p>

<p>Still ride in triumph over all mischance.</p>

<p>Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief.</p>

<p>It shall be eased if France can yield relief.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts</p>

<p>And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.</p>

<p>Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis</p>

<p>That Henry, sole possessor of my love,</p>

<p>Is, of a king, become a banished man</p>

<p>And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;</p>

<p>While proud ambitious Edward, Duke of York,</p>

<p>Usurps the regal title and the seat</p>

<p>Of England’s true-anointed lawful king.</p>

<p>This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,</p>

<p>With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry’s heir,</p>

<p>Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;</p>

<p>And if thou fail us, all our hope is done.</p>

<p>Scotland hath will to help but cannot help;</p>

<p>Our people and our peers are both misled,</p>

<p>Our treasure seized, our soldiers put to flight,</p>

<p>And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm</p>

<p>While we bethink a means to break it off.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>The more I stay, the more I’ll succor thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Warwick, wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>What’s he approacheth boldly to our presence?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Our Earl of Warwick, Edward’s greatest friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span> <i>[standing]</i></p>

<p>Welcome, brave Warwick. What brings thee to France?</p>

<p><center><i>[He descends. She ariseth.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,</p>

<p>For this is he that moves both wind and tide.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>From worthy Edward, King of Albion,</p>

<p>My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend,</p>

<p>I come in kindness and unfeigned love,</p>

<p>First, to do greetings to thy royal person,</p>

<p>And then to crave a league of amity,</p>

<p>And, lastly, to confirm that amity</p>

<p>With nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant</p>

<p>That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,</p>

<p>To England’s king in lawful marriage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>If that go forward, Henry’s hope is done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span> <i>[speaking to Lady Bona]</i></p>

<p>And, gracious madam, in our king’s behalf,</p>

<p>I am commanded, with your leave and favor,</p>

<p>Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue</p>

<p>To tell the passion of my sovereign’s heart,</p>

<p>Where fame, late ent’ring at his heedful ears,</p>

<p>Hath placed thy beauty’s image and thy virtue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak</p>

<p>Before you answer Warwick. His demand</p>

<p>Springs not from Edward’s well-meant honest love,</p>

<p>But from deceit, bred by necessity;</p>

<p>For how can tyrants safely govern home</p>

<p>Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?</p>

<p>To prove him tyrant, this reason may suffice:</p>

<p>That Henry liveth still; but were he dead,</p>

<p>Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry’s son.</p>

<p>Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and</p>

<p>marriage</p>

<p>Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonor;</p>

<p>For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,</p>

<p>Yet heav’ns are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Injurious Margaret!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span>  And why not “Queen”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Because thy father Henry did usurp,</p>

<p>And thou no more art prince than she is queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oxford</span></p>

<p>Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,</p>

<p>Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;</p>

<p>And after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,</p>

<p>Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;</p>

<p>And after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,</p>

<p>Who by his prowess conquered all France.</p>

<p>From these our Henry lineally descends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse</p>

<p>You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost</p>

<p>All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten.</p>

<p>Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.</p>

<p>But, for the rest: you tell a pedigree</p>

<p>Of threescore and two years, a silly time</p>

<p>To make prescription for a kingdom’s worth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oxford</span></p>

<p>Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,</p>

<p>Whom thou obeyed’st thirty and six years,</p>

<p>And not bewray thy treason with a blush?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,</p>

<p>Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?</p>

<p>For shame, leave Henry, and call Edward king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oxford</span></p>

<p>Call him my king, by whose injurious doom</p>

<p>My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,</p>

<p>Was done to death? And more than so, my father,</p>

<p>Even in the downfall of his mellowed years,</p>

<p>When nature brought him to the door of death?</p>

<p>No, Warwick, no. While life upholds this arm,</p>

<p>This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span>  And I the house of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,</p>

<p>Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside</p>

<p>While I use further conference with Warwick.</p>

<p><center><i>[They stand aloof.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Heavens grant that Warwick’s words bewitch him</p>

<p>not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,</p>

<p>Is Edward your true king? For I were loath</p>

<p>To link with him that were not lawful chosen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>But is he gracious in the people’s eye?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>The more that Henry was unfortunate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Then further, all dissembling set aside,</p>

<p>Tell me for truth the measure of his love</p>

<p>Unto our sister Bona.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span>  Such it seems</p>

<p>As may beseem a monarch like himself.</p>

<p>Myself have often heard him say and swear</p>

<p>That this his love was an eternal plant,</p>

<p>Whereof the root was fixed in virtue’s ground,</p>

<p>The leaves and fruit maintained with beauty’s sun,</p>

<p>Exempt from envy but not from disdain,</p>

<p>Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Bona</span></p>

<p>Your grant or your denial shall be mine.</p>

<p><i>[(Speaks to Warwick.)]</i> Yet I confess that often ere this</p>

<p>day,</p>

<p>When I have heard your king’s desert recounted,</p>

<p>Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward’s.</p>

<p>And now forthwith shall articles be drawn</p>

<p>Touching the jointure that your king must make,</p>

<p>Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.–</p>

<p>Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness</p>

<p>That Bona shall be wife to the English king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>To Edward, but not to the English king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device</p>

<p>By this alliance to make void my suit.</p>

<p>Before thy coming, Lewis was Henry’s friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>And still is friend to him and Margaret.</p>

<p>But if your title to the crown be weak,</p>

<p>As may appear by Edward’s good success,</p>

<p>Then ’tis but reason that I be released</p>

<p>From giving aid which late I promised.</p>

<p>Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand</p>

<p>That your estate requires and mine can yield.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,</p>

<p>Where, having nothing, nothing can he lose.–</p>

<p>And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,</p>

<p>You have a father able to maintain you,</p>

<p>And better ’twere you troubled him than France.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,</p>

<p>Proud setter-up and puller-down of kings!</p>

<p>I will not hence till with my talk and tears,</p>

<p>Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold</p>

<p>Thy sly conveyance and thy lord’s false love,</p>

<p>For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.</p>

<p><center><i>[Post blowing a horn within.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Post.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Post</span> <i>[speaks to Warwick.]</i></p>

<p>My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,</p>

<p>Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague.</p>

<p><i>[(To Lewis.)]</i> These from our king unto your Majesty.</p>

<p><i>[(To Margaret.)]</i> And, madam, these for you–from</p>

<p>whom, I know not.     <i><i>[They all read their letters.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oxford</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I like it well that our fair queen and mistress</p>

<p>Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled.</p>

<p>I hope all’s for the best.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair queen?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Mine, full of sorrow and heart’s discontent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>What, has your king married the Lady Grey,</p>

<p>And now, to soothe your forgery and his,</p>

<p>Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?</p>

<p>Is this th’ alliance that he seeks with France?</p>

<p>Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>I told your Majesty as much before.</p>

<p>This proveth Edward’s love and Warwick’s honesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven</p>

<p>And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,</p>

<p>That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward’s–</p>

<p>No more my king, for he dishonors me,</p>

<p>But most himself, if he could see his shame.</p>

<p>Did I forget that by the house of York</p>

<p>My father came untimely to his death?</p>

<p>Did I let pass th’ abuse done to my niece?</p>

<p>Did I impale him with the regal crown?</p>

<p>Did I put Henry from his native right?</p>

<p>And am I guerdoned at the last with shame?</p>

<p>Shame on himself, for my desert is honor!</p>

<p>And to repair my honor lost for him,</p>

<p>I here renounce him and return to Henry.</p>

<p><center><i>[He removes the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<p>My noble queen, let former grudges pass,</p>

<p>And henceforth I am thy true servitor.</p>

<p>I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona</p>

<p>And replant Henry in his former state.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Warwick, these words have turned my hate to love,</p>

<p>And I forgive and quite forget old faults,</p>

<p>And joy that thou becom’st King Henry’s friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,</p>

<p>That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us</p>

<p>With some few bands of chosen soldiers,</p>

<p>I’ll undertake to land them on our coast</p>

<p>And force the tyrant from his seat by war.</p>

<p>’Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him.</p>

<p>And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,</p>

<p>He’s very likely now to fall from him</p>

<p>For matching more for wanton lust than honor,</p>

<p>Or than for strength and safety of our country.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Bona</span></p>

<p>Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged</p>

<p>But by thy help to this distressed queen?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live</p>

<p>Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Bona</span></p>

<p>My quarrel and this English queen’s are one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>And mine with hers and thine and Margaret’s.</p>

<p>Therefore at last I firmly am resolved</p>

<p>You shall have aid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Let me give humble thanks for all, at once.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Then, England’s messenger, return in post,</p>

<p>And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,</p>

<p>That Lewis of France is sending over maskers</p>

<p>To revel it with him and his new bride.</p>

<p>Thou seest what’s passed; go fear thy king withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Bona</span></p>

<p>Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly,</p>

<p>I wear the willow garland for his sake.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside</p>

<p>And I am ready to put armor on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</p>

<p>And therefore I’ll uncrown him ere ’t be long.</p>

<p>There’s thy reward.     <i><i>[Gives money.]</i></i></p>

<p>Be gone.     <i><i>[Post exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span>  But, Warwick,</p>

<p>Thou and Oxford with five thousand men</p>

<p>Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle;</p>

<p>And as occasion serves, this noble queen</p>

<p>And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.</p>

<p>Yet ere thou go, but answer me one doubt:</p>

<p>What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>This shall assure my constant loyalty:</p>

<p>That if our queen and this young prince agree,</p>

<p>I’ll join mine eldest daughter, and my joy,</p>

<p>To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.</p>

<p>Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous.</p>

<p>Therefore, delay not; give thy hand to Warwick,</p>

<p>And with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,</p>

<p>That only Warwick’s daughter shall be thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it,</p>

<p>And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives his hand to Warwick.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Lewis</span></p>

<p>Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,</p>

<p>And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral,</p>

<p>Shall waft them over with our royal fleet.</p>

<p>I long till Edward fall by war’s mischance</p>

<p>For mocking marriage with a dame of France.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[All but Warwick exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>I came from Edward as ambassador,</p>

<p>But I return his sworn and mortal foe.</p>

<p>Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,</p>

<p>But dreadful war shall answer his demand.</p>

<p>Had he none else to make a stale but me?</p>

<p>Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.</p>

<p>I was the chief that raised him to the crown,</p>

<p>And I’ll be chief to bring him down again:</p>

<p>Not that I pity Henry’s misery,</p>

<p>But seek revenge on Edward’s mockery.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
