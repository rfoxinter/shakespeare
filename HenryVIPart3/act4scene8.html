<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King Henry, Warwick, Montague,</p>

<p>Clarence, Oxford, and Exeter, all wearing the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,</p>

<p>With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,</p>

<p>Hath passed in safety through the Narrow Seas,</p>

<p>And with his troops doth march amain to London,</p>

<p>And many giddy people flock to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Let’s levy men and beat him back again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clarence</sc></p>

<p>A little fire is quickly trodden out,</p>

<p>Which, being suffered, rivers cannot quench.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,</p>

<p>Not mutinous in peace yet bold in war.</p>

<p>Those will I muster up; and thou, son Clarence,</p>

<p>Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent</p>

<p>The knights and gentlemen to come with thee.–</p>

<p>Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,</p>

<p>Northampton, and in Leicestershire shalt find</p>

<p>Men well inclined to hear what thou command’st.–</p>

<p>And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,</p>

<p>In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.–</p>

<p>My sovereign, with the loving citizens,</p>

<p>Like to his island girt in with the ocean,</p>

<p>Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,</p>

<p>Shall rest in London till we come to him.</p>

<p>Fair lords, take leave, and stand not to reply.–</p>

<p>Farewell, my sovereign.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, my Hector and my Troy’s true hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clarence</sc></p>

<p>In sign of truth, I kiss your Highness’ hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montague</sc></p>

<p>Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oxford</sc></p>

<p>And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kisses Henry’s hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Sweet Oxford and my loving Montague</p>

<p>And all at once, once more a happy farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, sweet lords. Let’s meet at Coventry.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but King Henry and Exeter exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Here at the palace will I rest awhile.</p>

<p>Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your Lordship?</p>

<p>Methinks the power that Edward hath in field</p>

<p>Should not be able to encounter mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>That’s not my fear. My meed hath got me fame.</p>

<p>I have not stopped mine ears to their demands,</p>

<p>Nor posted off their suits with slow delays.</p>

<p>My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,</p>

<p>My mildness hath allayed their swelling griefs,</p>

<p>My mercy dried their water-flowing tears.</p>

<p>I have not been desirous of their wealth</p>

<p>Nor much oppressed them with great subsidies,</p>

<p>Nor forward of revenge, though they much erred.</p>

<p>Then why should they love Edward more than me?</p>

<p>No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace;</p>

<p>And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,</p>

<p>The lamb will never cease to follow him.</p>

<p><center><i>[Shout within “A York! A York!”]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>Hark, hark, my lord, what shouts are these?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King Edward and Richard and Soldiers,</p>

<p>all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Seize on the shamefaced Henry, bear him hence,</p>

<p>And once again proclaim us King of England.–</p>

<p>You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow.</p>

<p>Now stops thy spring; my sea shall suck them dry</p>

<p>And swell so much the higher by their ebb.–</p>

<p>Hence with him to the Tower. Let him not speak.</p>

<p><center><i>[Soldiers exit with King Henry and Exeter.]</i></center></p>

<p>And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course,</p>

<p>Where peremptory Warwick now remains.</p>

<p>The sun shines hot, and if we use delay,</p>

<p>Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Away betimes, before his forces join,</p>

<p>And take the great-grown traitor unawares.</p>

<p>Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
