<p><center><i>[Alarum and excursions. Enter King Edward,</p>

<p>wearing the white rose, bringing forth Warwick,</p>

<p>wearing the red rose, wounded.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>So, lie thou there. Die thou, and die our fear,</p>

<p>For Warwick was a bug that feared us all.</p>

<p>Now, Montague, sit fast. I seek for thee,</p>

<p>That Warwick’s bones may keep thine company.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe,</p>

<p>And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?</p>

<p>Why ask I that? My mangled body shows,</p>

<p>My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows</p>

<p>That I must yield my body to the earth</p>

<p>And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.</p>

<p>Thus yields the cedar to the axe’s edge,</p>

<p>Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,</p>

<p>Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,</p>

<p>Whose top branch overpeered Jove’s spreading tree</p>

<p>And kept low shrubs from winter’s pow’rful wind.</p>

<p>These eyes, that now are dimmed with death’s black</p>

<p>veil,</p>

<p>Have been as piercing as the midday sun</p>

<p>To search the secret treasons of the world.</p>

<p>The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,</p>

<p>Were likened oft to kingly sepulchers,</p>

<p>For who lived king but I could dig his grave?</p>

<p>And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?</p>

<p>Lo, now my glory smeared in dust and blood!</p>

<p>My parks, my walks, my manors that I had</p>

<p>Even now forsake me; and of all my lands</p>

<p>Is nothing left me but my body’s length.</p>

<p>Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?</p>

<p>And live we how we can, yet die we must.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Oxford and Somerset, both wearing the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Ah, Warwick, Warwick, wert thou as we are,</p>

<p>We might recover all our loss again.</p>

<p>The Queen from France hath brought a puissant</p>

<p>power;</p>

<p>Even now we heard the news. Ah, could’st thou fly–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Why, then, I would not fly. Ah, Montague,</p>

<p>If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand</p>

<p>And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile.</p>

<p>Thou lov’st me not, for, brother, if thou didst,</p>

<p>Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood</p>

<p>That glues my lips and will not let me speak.</p>

<p>Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Ah, Warwick, Montague hath breathed his last,</p>

<p>And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,</p>

<p>And said “Commend me to my valiant brother.”</p>

<p>And more he would have said, and more he spoke,</p>

<p>Which sounded like a cannon in a vault,</p>

<p>That mought not be distinguished, but at last</p>

<p>I well might hear, delivered with a groan,</p>

<p>“O, farewell, Warwick.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves,</p>

<p>For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.</p>

<p><center><i>[He dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oxford</span></p>

<p>Away, away, to meet the Queen’s great power!</p>

<p><center><i>[Here they bear away his body. They exit.]</i></center></p>
