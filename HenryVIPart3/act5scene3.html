<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King Edward in triumph, with Richard,</p>

<p>Clarence, and the rest, all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,</p>

<p>And we are graced with wreaths of victory.</p>

<p>But in the midst of this bright-shining day,</p>

<p>I spy a black suspicious threat’ning cloud</p>

<p>That will encounter with our glorious sun</p>

<p>Ere he attain his easeful western bed.</p>

<p>I mean, my lords, those powers that the Queen</p>

<p>Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast</p>

<p>And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clarence</sc></p>

<p>A little gale will soon disperse that cloud</p>

<p>And blow it to the source from whence it came;</p>

<p>Thy very beams will dry those vapors up,</p>

<p>For every cloud engenders not a storm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong,</p>

<p>And Somerset, with Oxford, fled to her.</p>

<p>If she have time to breathe, be well assured</p>

<p>Her faction will be full as strong as ours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>We are advertised by our loving friends</p>

<p>That they do hold their course toward Tewkesbury.</p>

<p>We having now the best at Barnet Field</p>

<p>Will thither straight, for willingness rids way,</p>

<p>And, as we march, our strength will be augmented</p>

<p>In every county as we go along.</p>

<p>Strike up the drum, cry “Courage!” and away.</p>
