<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King Henry, Queen Margaret,</p>

<p>Clifford, Northumberland, and young Prince Edward,</p>

<p>all wearing the red rose with Drum and Trumpets,</p>

<p>the head of York fixed above them.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[to King Henry]</i></p>

<p>Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.</p>

<p>Yonder’s the head of that arch-enemy</p>

<p>That sought to be encompassed with your crown.</p>

<p>Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack!</p>

<p>To see this sight, it irks my very soul.</p>

<p>Withhold revenge, dear God! ’Tis not my fault,</p>

<p>Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>My gracious liege, this too much lenity</p>

<p>And harmful pity must be laid aside.</p>

<p>To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?</p>

<p>Not to the beast that would usurp their den.</p>

<p>Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?</p>

<p>Not his that spoils her young before her face.</p>

<p>Who scapes the lurking serpent’s mortal sting?</p>

<p>Not he that sets his foot upon her back.</p>

<p>The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on,</p>

<p>And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.</p>

<p>Ambitious York did level at thy crown,</p>

<p>Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows.</p>

<p>He, but a duke, would have his son a king</p>

<p>And raise his issue like a loving sire;</p>

<p>Thou being a king, blest with a goodly son,</p>

<p>Didst yield consent to disinherit him,</p>

<p>Which argued thee a most unloving father.</p>

<p>Unreasonable creatures feed their young;</p>

<p>And though man’s face be fearful to their eyes,</p>

<p>Yet in protection of their tender ones,</p>

<p>Who hath not seen them, even with those wings</p>

<p>Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,</p>

<p>Make war with him that climbed unto their nest,</p>

<p>Offering their own lives in their young’s defense?</p>

<p>For shame, my liege, make them your precedent.</p>

<p>Were it not pity that this goodly boy</p>

<p>Should lose his birthright by his father’s fault,</p>

<p>And long hereafter say unto his child</p>

<p>“What my great-grandfather and grandsire got,</p>

<p>My careless father fondly gave away”?</p>

<p>Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy,</p>

<p>And let his manly face, which promiseth</p>

<p>Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart</p>

<p>To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Full well hath Clifford played the orator,</p>

<p>Inferring arguments of mighty force.</p>

<p>But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear</p>

<p>That things ill got had ever bad success?</p>

<p>And happy always was it for that son</p>

<p>Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?</p>

<p>I’ll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind,</p>

<p>And would my father had left me no more;</p>

<p>For all the rest is held at such a rate</p>

<p>As brings a thousandfold more care to keep</p>

<p>Than in possession any jot of pleasure.</p>

<p>Ah, cousin York, would thy best friends did know</p>

<p>How it doth grieve me that thy head is here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,</p>

<p>And this soft courage makes your followers faint.</p>

<p>You promised knighthood to our forward son.</p>

<p>Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently.–</p>

<p>Edward, kneel down.     <i><i>[He kneels.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[dubbing him knight]</i></p>

<p>Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight,</p>

<p>And learn this lesson: draw thy sword in right.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span> <i>[rising]</i></p>

<p>My gracious father, by your kingly leave,</p>

<p>I’ll draw it as apparent to the crown</p>

<p>And in that quarrel use it to the death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Royal commanders, be in readiness,</p>

<p>For with a band of thirty thousand men</p>

<p>Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York,</p>

<p>And in the towns as they do march along</p>

<p>Proclaims him king, and many fly to him.</p>

<p>Deraign your battle, for they are at hand.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>I would your Highness would depart the field.</p>

<p>The Queen hath best success when you are absent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Why, that’s my fortune too; therefore I’ll stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Be it with resolution, then, to fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>My royal father, cheer these noble lords</p>

<p>And hearten those that fight in your defense.</p>

<p>Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry “Saint</p>

<p>George!”</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[March. Enter Edward, Warwick, Richard,</p>

<p>George, Norfolk, Montague, and Soldiers,</p>

<p>all wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Now, perjured Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace</p>

<p>And set thy diadem upon my head,</p>

<p>Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.</p>

<p>Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms</p>

<p>Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>I am his king, and he should bow his knee.</p>

<p>I was adopted heir by his consent.</p>

<p>Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,</p>

<p>You that are king, though he do wear the crown,</p>

<p>Have caused him, by new act of Parliament,</p>

<p>To blot out me and put his own son in.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span>  And reason too:</p>

<p>Who should succeed the father but the son?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>Ay, crookback, here I stand to answer thee,</p>

<p>Or any he, the proudest of thy sort.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>’Twas you that killed young Rutland, was it not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>For God’s sake, lords, give signal to the fight!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>What sayst thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick, dare you</p>

<p>speak?</p>

<p>When you and I met at Saint Albans last,</p>

<p>Your legs did better service than your hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Then ’twas my turn to fly, and now ’tis thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>You said so much before, and yet you fled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>’Twas not your valor, Clifford, drove me thence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.–</p>

<p>Break off the parley, for scarce I can refrain</p>

<p>The execution of my big-swoll’n heart</p>

<p>Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>I slew thy father; call’st thou him a child?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,</p>

<p>As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland.</p>

<p>But ere sunset I’ll make thee curse the deed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Have done with words, my lords, and hear me</p>

<p>speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Defy them, then, or else hold close thy lips.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>I prithee, give no limits to my tongue.</p>

<p>I am a king and privileged to speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here</p>

<p>Cannot be cured by words; therefore, be still.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.</p>

<p>By Him that made us all, I am resolved</p>

<p>That Clifford’s manhood lies upon his tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Say, Henry, shall I have my right or no?</p>

<p>A thousand men have broke their fasts today</p>

<p>That ne’er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>If thou deny, their blood upon thy head,</p>

<p>For York in justice puts his armor on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>If that be right which Warwick says is right,</p>

<p>There is no wrong, but everything is right.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands,</p>

<p>For well I wot thou hast thy mother’s tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam,</p>

<p>But like a foul misshapen stigmatic,</p>

<p>Marked by the Destinies to be avoided,</p>

<p>As venom toads or lizards’ dreadful stings.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Iron of Naples, hid with English gilt,</p>

<p>Whose father bears the title of a king,</p>

<p>As if a channel should be called the sea,</p>

<p>Sham’st thou not, knowing whence thou art</p>

<p>extraught,</p>

<p>To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns</p>

<p>To make this shameless callet know herself.–</p>

<p>Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,</p>

<p>Although thy husband may be Menelaus;</p>

<p>And ne’er was Agamemnon’s brother wronged</p>

<p>By that false woman as this king by thee.</p>

<p>His father reveled in the heart of France,</p>

<p>And tamed the King, and made the Dauphin stoop;</p>

<p>And had he matched according to his state,</p>

<p>He might have kept that glory to this day.</p>

<p>But when he took a beggar to his bed</p>

<p>And graced thy poor sire with his bridal day,</p>

<p>Even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him</p>

<p>That washed his father’s fortunes forth of France</p>

<p>And heaped sedition on his crown at home.</p>

<p>For what hath broached this tumult but thy pride?</p>

<p>Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept,</p>

<p>And we, in pity of the gentle king,</p>

<p>Had slipped our claim until another age.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>George</span></p>

<p>But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,</p>

<p>And that thy summer bred us no increase,</p>

<p>We set the axe to thy usurping root;</p>

<p>And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,</p>

<p>Yet know thou, since we have begun to strike,</p>

<p>We’ll never leave till we have hewn thee down</p>

<p>Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>And in this resolution, I defy thee,</p>

<p>Not willing any longer conference,</p>

<p>Since thou denied’st the gentle king to speak.–</p>

<p>Sound, trumpets! Let our bloody colors wave;</p>

<p>And either victory or else a grave!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Stay, Edward!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>No, wrangling woman, we’ll no longer stay.</p>

<p>These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.</p>
