<p><center><i>[Enter two Gamekeepers,</p>

<p>with crossbows in their hands.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>Under this thick-grown brake we’ll shroud ourselves,</p>

<p>For through this laund anon the deer will come;</p>

<p>And in this covert will we make our stand,</p>

<p>Culling the principal of all the deer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>I’ll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>That cannot be. The noise of thy crossbow</p>

<p>Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.</p>

<p>Here stand we both, and aim we at the best.</p>

<p>And for the time shall not seem tedious,</p>

<p>I’ll tell thee what befell me on a day</p>

<p>In this self place where now we mean to stand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>Here comes a man; let’s stay till he be past.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King Henry, in disguise, with a prayer book.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>From Scotland am I stol’n, even of pure love,</p>

<p>To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.</p>

<p>No, Harry, Harry, ’tis no land of thine!</p>

<p>Thy place is filled, thy scepter wrung from thee,</p>

<p>Thy balm washed off wherewith thou wast anointed.</p>

<p>No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,</p>

<p>No humble suitors press to speak for right,</p>

<p>No, not a man comes for redress of thee;</p>

<p>For how can I help them an not myself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc> <i>[aside to Second Gamekeeper]</i></p>

<p>Ay, here’s a deer whose skin’s a keeper’s fee.</p>

<p>This is the quondam king. Let’s seize upon him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Let me embrace the sour adversaries,</p>

<p>For wise men say it is the wisest course.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc> <i>[aside to First Gamekeeper]</i></p>

<p>Why linger we? Let us lay hands upon him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc> <i>[aside to Second Gamekeeper]</i></p>

<p>Forbear awhile; we’ll hear a little more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>My queen and son are gone to France for aid,</p>

<p>And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick</p>

<p>Is thither gone to crave the French king’s sister</p>

<p>To wife for Edward. If this news be true,</p>

<p>Poor queen and son, your labor is but lost,</p>

<p>For Warwick is a subtle orator,</p>

<p>And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.</p>

<p>By this account, then, Margaret may win him,</p>

<p>For she’s a woman to be pitied much.</p>

<p>Her sighs will make a batt’ry in his breast,</p>

<p>Her tears will pierce into a marble heart.</p>

<p>The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn,</p>

<p>And Nero will be tainted with remorse</p>

<p>To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.</p>

<p>Ay, but she’s come to beg, Warwick to give;</p>

<p>She on his left side craving aid for Henry;</p>

<p>He on his right asking a wife for Edward.</p>

<p>She weeps and says her Henry is deposed;</p>

<p>He smiles and says his Edward is installed;</p>

<p>That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more,</p>

<p>Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,</p>

<p>Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,</p>

<p>And in conclusion wins the King from her</p>

<p>With promise of his sister and what else</p>

<p>To strengthen and support King Edward’s place.</p>

<p>O Margaret, thus ’twill be, and thou, poor soul,</p>

<p>Art then forsaken, as thou went’st forlorn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>Say, what art thou that talk’st of kings and queens?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>More than I seem, and less than I was born to:</p>

<p>A man at least, for less I should not be;</p>

<p>And men may talk of kings, and why not I?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>Ay, but thou talk’st as if thou wert a king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Why, so I am in mind, and that’s enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>But if thou be a king, where is thy crown?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>My crown is in my heart, not on my head;</p>

<p>Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,</p>

<p>Nor to be seen. My crown is called content;</p>

<p>A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>Well, if you be a king crowned with content,</p>

<p>Your crown content and you must be contented</p>

<p>To go along with us. For, as we think,</p>

<p>You are the king King Edward hath deposed;</p>

<p>And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance</p>

<p>Will apprehend you as his enemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>But did you never swear and break an oath?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>No, never such an oath, nor will not now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Where did you dwell when I was King of England?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>Here in this country, where we now remain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>I was anointed king at nine months old.</p>

<p>My father and my grandfather were kings,</p>

<p>And you were sworn true subjects unto me.</p>

<p>And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>No, for we were subjects but while you were king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?</p>

<p>Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear.</p>

<p>Look as I blow this feather from my face</p>

<p>And as the air blows it to me again,</p>

<p>Obeying with my wind when I do blow</p>

<p>And yielding to another when it blows,</p>

<p>Commanded always by the greater gust,</p>

<p>Such is the lightness of you common men.</p>

<p>But do not break your oaths, for of that sin</p>

<p>My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.</p>

<p>Go where you will, the King shall be commanded,</p>

<p>And be you kings: command, and I’ll obey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>So would you be again to Henry</p>

<p>If he were seated as King Edward is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gamekeeper</sc></p>

<p>We charge you in God’s name and the King’s</p>

<p>To go with us unto the officers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>In God’s name, lead. Your king’s name be obeyed,</p>

<p>And what God will, that let your king perform.</p>

<p>And what he will, I humbly yield unto.</p>
