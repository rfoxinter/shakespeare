<p><center><i>[Enter Queen Elizabeth, with the Duchess of York, and</p>

<p>the Lord Marquess of Dorset, at one door; Anne,</p>

<p>Duchess of Gloucester with Clarence’s daughter, at</p>

<p>another door.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet</p>

<p>Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?</p>

<p>Now, for my life, she’s wandering to the Tower,</p>

<p>On pure heart’s love, to greet the tender prince.–</p>

<p>Daughter, well met.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  God give your Graces both</p>

<p>A happy and a joyful time of day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span></p>

<p>As much to you, good sister. Whither away?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>No farther than the Tower, and, as I guess,</p>

<p>Upon the like devotion as yourselves,</p>

<p>To gratulate the gentle princes there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span></p>

<p>Kind sister, thanks. We’ll enter all together.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Brakenbury, the Lieutenant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>And in good time here the Lieutenant comes.–</p>

<p>Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,</p>

<p>How doth the Prince and my young son of York?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brakenbury</span></p>

<p>Right well, dear madam. By your patience,</p>

<p>I may not suffer you to visit them.</p>

<p>The King hath strictly charged the contrary.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span></p>

<p>The King? Who’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brakenbury</span>  I mean, the Lord Protector.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span></p>

<p>The Lord protect him from that kingly title!</p>

<p>Hath he set bounds between their love and me?</p>

<p>I am their mother. Who shall bar me from them?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>I am their father’s mother. I will see them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.</p>

<p>Then bring me to their sights. I’ll bear thy blame</p>

<p>And take thy office from thee, on my peril.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brakenbury</span></p>

<p>No, madam, no. I may not leave it so.</p>

<p>I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Brakenbury the Lieutenant exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Stanley.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stanley</span></p>

<p>Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence,</p>

<p>And I’ll salute your Grace of York as mother</p>

<p>And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.</p>

<p><i>[To Anne.]</i> Come, madam, you must straight to</p>

<p>Westminster,</p>

<p>There to be crowned Richard’s royal queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>  Ah, cut my lace asunder</p>

<p>That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,</p>

<p>Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Despiteful tidings! O, unpleasing news!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dorset</span> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>Be of good cheer, mother. How fares your Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span></p>

<p>O Dorset, speak not to me. Get thee gone.</p>

<p>Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels.</p>

<p>Thy mother’s name is ominous to children.</p>

<p>If thou wilt outstrip death, go, cross the seas,</p>

<p>And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.</p>

<p>Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughterhouse,</p>

<p>Lest thou increase the number of the dead</p>

<p>And make me die the thrall of Margaret’s curse,</p>

<p>Nor mother, wife, nor England’s counted queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stanley</span></p>

<p>Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.</p>

<p><i>[To Dorset.]</i> Take all the swift advantage of the</p>

<p>hours.</p>

<p>You shall have letters from me to my son</p>

<p>In your behalf, to meet you on the way.</p>

<p>Be not ta’en tardy by unwise delay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>O ill-dispersing wind of misery!</p>

<p>O my accursed womb, the bed of death!</p>

<p>A cockatrice hast thou hatched to the world,</p>

<p>Whose unavoided eye is murderous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stanley</span> <i>[to Anne]</i></p>

<p>Come, madam, come. I in all haste was sent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>And I with all unwillingness will go.</p>

<p>O, would to God that the inclusive verge</p>

<p>Of golden metal that must round my brow</p>

<p>Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brains!</p>

<p>Anointed let me be with deadly venom,</p>

<p>And die ere men can say “God save the Queen.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span></p>

<p>Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory.</p>

<p>To feed my humor, wish thyself no harm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>No? Why? When he that is my husband now</p>

<p>Came to me as I followed Henry’s corse,</p>

<p>When scarce the blood was well washed from his</p>

<p>hands</p>

<p>Which issued from my other angel husband</p>

<p>And that dear saint which then I weeping followed–</p>

<p>O, when, I say, I looked on Richard’s face,</p>

<p>This was my wish: be thou, quoth I, accursed</p>

<p>For making me, so young, so old a widow;</p>

<p>And, when thou wedd’st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;</p>

<p>And be thy wife, if any be so mad,</p>

<p>More miserable by the life of thee</p>

<p>Than thou hast made me by my dear lord’s death.</p>

<p>Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,</p>

<p>Within so small a time my woman’s heart</p>

<p>Grossly grew captive to his honey words</p>

<p>And proved the subject of mine own soul’s curse,</p>

<p>Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest,</p>

<p>For never yet one hour in his bed</p>

<p>Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,</p>

<p>But with his timorous dreams was still awaked.</p>

<p>Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick,</p>

<p>And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span></p>

<p>Poor heart, adieu. I pity thy complaining.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dorset</span></p>

<p>Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Adieu, poor soul that tak’st thy leave of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span> <i>[to Dorset]</i></p>

<p>Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee.</p>

<p><i>[To Anne.]</i> Go thou to Richard, and good angels</p>

<p>tend thee.</p>

<p><i>[To Queen Elizabeth.]</i> Go thou to sanctuary, and</p>

<p>good thoughts possess thee.</p>

<p>I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me.</p>

<p>Eighty-odd years of sorrow have I seen,</p>

<p>And each hour’s joy wracked with a week of teen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span></p>

<p>Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.–</p>

<p>Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes</p>

<p>Whom envy hath immured within your walls–</p>

<p>Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.</p>

<p>Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow</p>

<p>For tender princes, use my babies well.</p>

<p>So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.</p>
