<p><center><i>[Enter old Queen Margaret.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>So now prosperity begins to mellow</p>

<p>And drop into the rotten mouth of death.</p>

<p>Here in these confines slyly have I lurked</p>

<p>To watch the waning of mine enemies.</p>

<p>A dire induction am I witness to,</p>

<p>And will to France, hoping the consequence</p>

<p>Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.</p>

<p>Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes</p>

<p>here?     <i><i>[She steps aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Duchess of York and Queen Elizabeth.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes,</p>

<p>My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets,</p>

<p>If yet your gentle souls fly in the air</p>

<p>And be not fixed in doom perpetual,</p>

<p>Hover about me with your airy wings</p>

<p>And hear your mother’s lamentation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Hover about her; say that right for right</p>

<p>Hath dimmed your infant morn to aged night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>So many miseries have crazed my voice</p>

<p>That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.</p>

<p>Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet;</p>

<p>Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs</p>

<p>And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?</p>

<p>When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost,</p>

<p>Woe’s scene, world’s shame, grave’s due by life</p>

<p>usurped,</p>

<p>Brief abstract and record of tedious days,</p>

<p>Rest thy unrest on England’s lawful earth,</p>

<p>Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc> <i>[as they both sit down]</i></p>

<p>Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave</p>

<p>As thou canst yield a melancholy seat,</p>

<p>Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.</p>

<p>Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[coming forward]</i></p>

<p>If ancient sorrow be most reverend,</p>

<p>Give mine the benefit of seigniory,</p>

<p>And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.</p>

<p>If sorrow can admit society,</p>

<p>Tell over your woes again by viewing mine.</p>

<p>I had an Edward till a Richard killed him;</p>

<p>I had a husband till a Richard killed him.</p>

<p>Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard killed him;</p>

<p>Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killed him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>I had a Richard too, and thou did’st kill him;</p>

<p>I had a Rutland too; thou holp’st to kill him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard killed him.</p>

<p>From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept</p>

<p>A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death–</p>

<p>That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,</p>

<p>To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood;</p>

<p>That excellent grand tyrant of the Earth,</p>

<p>That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls;</p>

<p>That foul defacer of God’s handiwork</p>

<p>Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.</p>

<p>O upright, just, and true-disposing God,</p>

<p>How do I thank thee that this carnal cur</p>

<p>Preys on the issue of his mother’s body</p>

<p>And makes her pew-fellow with others’ moan!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc> <i>[standing]</i></p>

<p>O Harry’s wife, triumph not in my woes!</p>

<p>God witness with me, I have wept for thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Bear with me. I am hungry for revenge,</p>

<p>And now I cloy me with beholding it.</p>

<p>Thy Edward he is dead, that killed my Edward,</p>

<p>Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;</p>

<p>Young York, he is but boot, because both they</p>

<p>Matched not the high perfection of my loss.</p>

<p>Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward,</p>

<p>And the beholders of this frantic play,</p>

<p>Th’ adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,</p>

<p>Untimely smothered in their dusky graves.</p>

<p>Richard yet lives, hell’s black intelligencer,</p>

<p>Only reserved their factor to buy souls</p>

<p>And send them thither. But at hand, at hand</p>

<p>Ensues his piteous and unpitied end.</p>

<p>Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,</p>

<p>To have him suddenly conveyed from hence.</p>

<p>Cancel his bond of life, dear God I pray,</p>

<p>That I may live and say “The dog is dead.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc> <i>[standing]</i></p>

<p>O, thou didst prophesy the time would come</p>

<p>That I should wish for thee to help me curse</p>

<p>That bottled spider, that foul bunch-backed toad!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>I called thee then “vain flourish of my fortune.”</p>

<p>I called thee then poor shadow, “painted queen,”</p>

<p>The presentation of but what I was,</p>

<p>The flattering index of a direful pageant,</p>

<p>One heaved a-high to be hurled down below,</p>

<p>A mother only mocked with two fair babes,</p>

<p>A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag</p>

<p>To be the aim of every dangerous shot,</p>

<p>A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,</p>

<p>A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.</p>

<p>Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers?</p>

<p>Where are thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy?</p>

<p>Who sues and kneels and says “God save the</p>

<p>Queen?”</p>

<p>Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?</p>

<p>Where be the thronging troops that followed thee?</p>

<p>Decline all this, and see what now thou art:</p>

<p>For happy wife, a most distressed widow;</p>

<p>For joyful mother, one that wails the name;</p>

<p>For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;</p>

<p>For queen, a very caitiff crowned with care;</p>

<p>For she that scorned at me, now scorned of me;</p>

<p>For she being feared of all, now fearing one;</p>

<p>For she commanding all, obeyed of none.</p>

<p>Thus hath the course of justice whirled about</p>

<p>And left thee but a very prey to time,</p>

<p>Having no more but thought of what thou wast</p>

<p>To torture thee the more, being what thou art.</p>

<p>Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not</p>

<p>Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?</p>

<p>Now thy proud neck bears half my burdened yoke,</p>

<p>From which even here I slip my weary head</p>

<p>And leave the burden of it all on thee.</p>

<p>Farewell, York’s wife, and queen of sad mischance.</p>

<p>These English woes shall make me smile in France.</p>

<p><center><i>[She begins to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>O, thou well-skilled in curses, stay awhile,</p>

<p>And teach me how to curse mine enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;</p>

<p>Compare dead happiness with living woe;</p>

<p>Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,</p>

<p>And he that slew them fouler than he is.</p>

<p>Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse.</p>

<p>Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>My words are dull. O, quicken them with thine!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like</p>

<p>mine.     <i><i>[Margaret exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Why should calamity be full of words?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Windy attorneys to their clients’ woes,</p>

<p>Airy succeeders of intestate joys,</p>

<p>Poor breathing orators of miseries,</p>

<p>Let them have scope; though what they will impart</p>

<p>Help nothing else, yet do they ease the heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me,</p>

<p>And in the breath of bitter words let’s smother</p>

<p>My damned son that thy two sweet sons smothered.</p>

<p><center><i>[A trumpet sounds.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[The trumpet sounds.]</i> Be copious in exclaims.</p>

<br/>

<p>     <i><i>[Enter King Richard and his train, including Catesby.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Who intercepts me in my expedition?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>O, she that might have intercepted thee,</p>

<p>By strangling thee in her accursed womb,</p>

<p>From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc> <i>[to Richard]</i></p>

<p>Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown</p>

<p>Where should be branded, if that right were right,</p>

<p>The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown</p>

<p>And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?</p>

<p>Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc> <i>[to Richard]</i></p>

<p>Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence,</p>

<p>And little Ned Plantagenet his son?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc> <i>[to Richard]</i></p>

<p>Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc> <i>[to Richard]</i>  Where is kind Hastings?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums!</p>

<p>Let not the heavens hear these telltale women</p>

<p>Rail on the Lord’s anointed. Strike, I say!</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. Alarums.]</i></center></p>

<p>Either be patient and entreat me fair,</p>

<p>Or with the clamorous report of war</p>

<p>Thus will I drown your exclamations.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc>  Art thou my son?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Then patiently hear my impatience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Madam, I have a touch of your condition,</p>

<p>That cannot brook the accent of reproof.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>O, let me speak!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Do then, but I’ll not hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>I will be mild and gentle in my words.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>And brief, good mother, for I am in haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Art thou so hasty? I have stayed for thee,</p>

<p>God knows, in torment and in agony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>And came I not at last to comfort you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>No, by the Holy Rood, thou know’st it well.</p>

<p>Thou cam’st on Earth to make the Earth my hell.</p>

<p>A grievous burden was thy birth to me;</p>

<p>Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;</p>

<p>Thy school days frightful, desp’rate, wild, and</p>

<p>furious;</p>

<p>Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;</p>

<p>Thy age confirmed, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,</p>

<p>More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred.</p>

<p>What comfortable hour canst thou name,</p>

<p>That ever graced me with thy company?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Faith, none but Humfrey Hower, that called your</p>

<p>Grace</p>

<p>To breakfast once, forth of my company.</p>

<p>If I be so disgracious in your eye,</p>

<p>Let me march on and not offend you, madam.–</p>

<p>Strike up the drum.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc>  I prithee, hear me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>You speak too bitterly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc>  Hear me a word,</p>

<p>For I shall never speak to thee again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  So.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Either thou wilt die by God’s just ordinance</p>

<p>Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,</p>

<p>Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish</p>

<p>And nevermore behold thy face again.</p>

<p>Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,</p>

<p>Which in the day of battle tire thee more</p>

<p>Than all the complete armor that thou wear’st.</p>

<p>My prayers on the adverse party fight,</p>

<p>And there the little souls of Edward’s children</p>

<p>Whisper the spirits of thine enemies</p>

<p>And promise them success and victory.</p>

<p>Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end.</p>

<p>Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to</p>

<p>curse</p>

<p>Abides in me. I say amen to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Stay, madam. I must talk a word with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>I have no more sons of the royal blood</p>

<p>For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,</p>

<p>They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens,</p>

<p>And therefore level not to hit their lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>You have a daughter called Elizabeth,</p>

<p>Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>And must she die for this? O, let her live,</p>

<p>And I’ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,</p>

<p>Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed,</p>

<p>Throw over her the veil of infamy.</p>

<p>So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter,</p>

<p>I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Wrong not her birth. She is a royal princess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>To save her life, I’ll say she is not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Her life is safest only in her birth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>And only in that safety died her brothers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Lo, at their birth good stars were opposite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>No, to their lives ill friends were contrary.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>All unavoided is the doom of destiny.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>True, when avoided grace makes destiny.</p>

<p>My babes were destined to a fairer death</p>

<p>If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Cousins, indeed, and by their uncle cozened</p>

<p>Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.</p>

<p>Whose hand soever launched their tender hearts,</p>

<p>Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction.</p>

<p>No doubt the murd’rous knife was dull and blunt</p>

<p>Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,</p>

<p>To revel in the entrails of my lambs.</p>

<p>But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,</p>

<p>My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys</p>

<p>Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes,</p>

<p>And I, in such a desp’rate bay of death,</p>

<p>Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft,</p>

<p>Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise</p>

<p>And dangerous success of bloody wars</p>

<p>As I intend more good to you and yours</p>

<p>Than ever you or yours by me were harmed!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>What good is covered with the face of heaven,</p>

<p>To be discovered, that can do me good?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Th’ advancement of your children, gentle lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Unto the dignity and height of fortune,</p>

<p>The high imperial type of this Earth’s glory.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Flatter my sorrow with report of it.</p>

<p>Tell me what state, what dignity, what honor,</p>

<p>Canst thou demise to any child of mine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Even all I have–ay, and myself and all–</p>

<p>Will I withal endow a child of thine;</p>

<p>So in the Lethe of thy angry soul</p>

<p>Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs</p>

<p>Which thou supposest I have done to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness</p>

<p>Last longer telling than thy kindness’ date.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>My daughter’s mother thinks it with her soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  What do you think?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul.</p>

<p>So from thy soul’s love didst thou love her brothers,</p>

<p>And from my heart’s love I do thank thee for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.</p>

<p>I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter</p>

<p>And do intend to make her Queen of England.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Well then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Even he that makes her queen. Who else should be?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>What, thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Even so. How think you of it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>How canst thou woo her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  That would I learn of you,</p>

<p>As one being best acquainted with her humor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc>  And wilt thou learn of me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Madam, with all my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,</p>

<p>A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave</p>

<p>“Edward” and “York.” Then haply will she weep.</p>

<p>Therefore present to her–as sometime Margaret</p>

<p>Did to thy father, steeped in Rutland’s blood–</p>

<p>A handkerchief, which say to her did drain</p>

<p>The purple sap from her sweet brother’s body,</p>

<p>And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.</p>

<p>If this inducement move her not to love,</p>

<p>Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;</p>

<p>Tell her thou mad’st away her uncle Clarence,</p>

<p>Her uncle Rivers, ay, and for her sake</p>

<p>Mad’st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>You mock me, madam. This is not the way</p>

<p>To win your daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc>  There is no other way,</p>

<p>Unless thou couldst put on some other shape</p>

<p>And not be Richard, that hath done all this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Say that I did all this for love of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,</p>

<p>Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Look what is done cannot be now amended.</p>

<p>Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,</p>

<p>Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.</p>

<p>If I did take the kingdom from your sons,</p>

<p>To make amends I’ll give it to your daughter.</p>

<p>If I have killed the issue of your womb,</p>

<p>To quicken your increase I will beget</p>

<p>Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.</p>

<p>A grandam’s name is little less in love</p>

<p>Than is the doting title of a mother.</p>

<p>They are as children but one step below,</p>

<p>Even of your metal, of your very blood,</p>

<p>Of all one pain, save for a night of groans</p>

<p>Endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow.</p>

<p>Your children were vexation to your youth,</p>

<p>But mine shall be a comfort to your age.</p>

<p>The loss you have is but a son being king,</p>

<p>And by that loss your daughter is made queen.</p>

<p>I cannot make you what amends I would;</p>

<p>Therefore accept such kindness as I can.</p>

<p>Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul</p>

<p>Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,</p>

<p>This fair alliance quickly shall call home</p>

<p>To high promotions and great dignity.</p>

<p>The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife</p>

<p>Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother.</p>

<p>Again shall you be mother to a king,</p>

<p>And all the ruins of distressful times</p>

<p>Repaired with double riches of content.</p>

<p>What, we have many goodly days to see!</p>

<p>The liquid drops of tears that you have shed</p>

<p>Shall come again, transformed to orient pearl,</p>

<p>Advantaging their love with interest</p>

<p>Of ten times double gain of happiness.</p>

<p>Go then, my mother; to thy daughter go.</p>

<p>Make bold her bashful years with your experience;</p>

<p>Prepare her ears to hear a wooer’s tale;</p>

<p>Put in her tender heart th’ aspiring flame</p>

<p>Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princess</p>

<p>With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys;</p>

<p>And when this arm of mine hath chastised</p>

<p>The petty rebel, dull-brained Buckingham,</p>

<p>Bound with triumphant garlands will I come</p>

<p>And lead thy daughter to a conqueror’s bed,</p>

<p>To whom I will retail my conquest won,</p>

<p>And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar’s Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>What were I best to say? Her father’s brother</p>

<p>Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?</p>

<p>Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?</p>

<p>Under what title shall I woo for thee,</p>

<p>That God, the law, my honor, and her love</p>

<p>Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Infer fair England’s peace by this alliance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Tell her the King, that may command, entreats–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>That, at her hands, which the King’s King forbids.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>To vail the title, as her mother doth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Say I will love her everlastingly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>But how long shall that title “ever” last?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Sweetly in force unto her fair life’s end.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>As long as hell and Richard likes of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Be eloquent in my behalf to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>O no, my reasons are too deep and dead–</p>

<p>Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Now by my George, my Garter, and my crown–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Profaned, dishonored, and the third usurped.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I swear–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc>  By nothing, for this is no oath.</p>

<p>Thy George, profaned, hath lost his lordly honor;</p>

<p>Thy Garter, blemished, pawned his knightly virtue;</p>

<p>Thy crown, usurped, disgraced his kingly glory.</p>

<p>If something thou wouldst swear to be believed,</p>

<p>Swear then by something that thou hast not</p>

<p>wronged.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Then, by myself–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc>  Thyself is self-misused.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Now, by the world–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc>  ’Tis full of thy foul wrongs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>My father’s death–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc>  Thy life hath it dishonored.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Why then, by God.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc>  God’s wrong is most of all.</p>

<p>If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him,</p>

<p>The unity the King my husband made</p>

<p>Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.</p>

<p>If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him,</p>

<p>Th’ imperial metal circling now thy head</p>

<p>Had graced the tender temples of my child,</p>

<p>And both the Princes had been breathing here,</p>

<p>Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,</p>

<p>Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.</p>

<p>What canst thou swear by now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  The time to come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>That thou hast wronged in the time o’erpast;</p>

<p>For I myself have many tears to wash</p>

<p>Hereafter time, for time past wronged by thee.</p>

<p>The children live whose fathers thou hast</p>

<p>slaughtered,</p>

<p>Ungoverned youth, to wail it in their age;</p>

<p>The parents live whose children thou hast</p>

<p>butchered,</p>

<p>Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.</p>

<p>Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast</p>

<p>Misused ere used, by times ill-used o’erpast.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>As I intend to prosper and repent,</p>

<p>So thrive I in my dangerous affairs</p>

<p>Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound,</p>

<p>Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours,</p>

<p>Day, yield me not thy light, nor night thy rest,</p>

<p>Be opposite all planets of good luck</p>

<p>To my proceeding if, with dear heart’s love,</p>

<p>Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,</p>

<p>I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.</p>

<p>In her consists my happiness and thine.</p>

<p>Without her follows to myself and thee,</p>

<p>Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,</p>

<p>Death, desolation, ruin, and decay.</p>

<p>It cannot be avoided but by this;</p>

<p>It will not be avoided but by this.</p>

<p>Therefore, dear mother–I must call you so–</p>

<p>Be the attorney of my love to her;</p>

<p>Plead what I will be, not what I have been;</p>

<p>Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.</p>

<p>Urge the necessity and state of times,</p>

<p>And be not peevish found in great designs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Shall I forget myself to be myself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ay, if your self’s remembrance wrong yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc>  Yet thou didst kill my children.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>But in your daughter’s womb I bury them,</p>

<p>Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed</p>

<p>Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>And be a happy mother by the deed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc>  I go. Write to me very shortly,</p>

<p>And you shall understand from me her mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Bear her my true love’s kiss; and so, farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[Queen exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Relenting fool and shallow, changing woman!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ratcliffe.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc></p>

<p>Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast</p>

<p>Rideth a puissant navy. To our shores</p>

<p>Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,</p>

<p>Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back.</p>

<p>’Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;</p>

<p>And there they hull, expecting but the aid</p>

<p>Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of</p>

<p>Norfolk–</p>

<p>Ratcliffe thyself, or Catesby. Where is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>Here, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Catesby, fly to the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>I will, my lord, with all convenient haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ratcliffe, come hither. Post to Salisbury.When thou com’st thither–<i>[To Catesby.]</i> Dull,</p>

<p>unmindful villain,</p>

<p>Why stay’st thou here and go’st not to the Duke?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness’ pleasure,</p>

<p>What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>O true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight</p>

<p>The greatest strength and power that he can make</p>

<p>And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc>  I go.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc></p>

<p>What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc></p>

<p>Your Highness told me I should post before.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>My mind is changed.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Stanley.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Stanley, what news with you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing,</p>

<p>Nor none so bad but well may be reported.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Hoyday, a riddle! Neither good nor bad.</p>

<p>What need’st thou run so many miles about</p>

<p>When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way?</p>

<p>Once more, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc>  Richmond is on the seas.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>There let him sink, and be the seas on him!</p>

<p>White-livered runagate, what doth he there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Well, as you guess?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>Stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton,</p>

<p>He makes for England, here to claim the crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Is the chair empty? Is the sword unswayed?</p>

<p>Is the King dead, the empire unpossessed?</p>

<p>What heir of York is there alive but we?</p>

<p>And who is England’s king but great York’s heir?</p>

<p>Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Unless for that he comes to be your liege,</p>

<p>You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.</p>

<p>Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>No, my good lord. Therefore mistrust me not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?</p>

<p>Where be thy tenants and thy followers?</p>

<p>Are they not now upon the western shore,</p>

<p>Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>No, my good lord. My friends are in the north.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Cold friends to me. What do they in the north</p>

<p>When they should serve their sovereign in the west?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>They have not been commanded, mighty king.</p>

<p>Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave,</p>

<p>I’ll muster up my friends and meet your Grace</p>

<p>Where and what time your Majesty shall please.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond,</p>

<p>But I’ll not trust thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc>  Most mighty sovereign,</p>

<p>You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.</p>

<p>I never was nor never will be false.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Go then and muster men, but leave behind</p>

<p>Your son George Stanley. Look your heart be firm,</p>

<p>Or else his head’s assurance is but frail.</p>

<br/>

<p>My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,</p>

<p>As I by friends am well advertised,</p>

<p>The news I have to tell your Majesty</p>

<p>Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters</p>

<p>Buckingham’s army is dispersed and scattered,</p>

<p>And he himself wandered away alone,</p>

<p>No man knows whither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  I cry thee mercy.</p>

<p>But this good comfort bring I to your Highness:</p>

<p>The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest.</p>

<p>Richmond, in Dorsetshire, sent out a boat</p>

<p>Unto the shore to ask those on the banks</p>

<p>If they were his assistants, yea, or no–</p>

<p>Who answered him they came from Buckingham</p>

<p>Upon his party. He, mistrusting them,</p>

<p>Hoised sail and made his course again for Brittany.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>March on, march on, since we are up in arms,</p>

<p>If not to fight with foreign enemies,</p>

<p>Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.</p>

<p>Is with a mighty power landed at Milford</p>

<p>Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.</p>
