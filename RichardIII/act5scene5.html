<p><center><i>[Alarum. Enter Richard and Richmond. They fight.</p>

<p>Richard is slain. Then retreat being sounded, Richmond</p>

<p>exits, and Richard’s body is removed. Flourish. Enter</p>

<p>Richmond, Stanley, Earl of Derby, bearing the crown,</p>

<p>with other Lords, and Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richmond</span></p>

<p>God and your arms be praised, victorious friends!</p>

<p>The day is ours; the bloody dog is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stanley</span> <i>[offering him the crown]</i></p>

<p>Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.</p>

<p>Lo, here this long-usurped royalty</p>

<p>From the dead temples of this bloody wretch</p>

<p>Have I plucked off, to grace thy brows withal.</p>

<p>Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richmond</span></p>

<p>Great God of heaven, say amen to all!</p>

<p>But tell me, is young George Stanley living?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stanley</span></p>

<p>He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,</p>

<p>Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richmond</span></p>

<p>What men of name are slain on either side?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stanley</span></p>

<p>John, Duke of Norfolk, Walter, Lord Ferrers,</p>

<p>Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richmond</span></p>

<p>Inter their bodies as becomes their births.</p>

<p>Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled</p>

<p>That in submission will return to us.</p>

<p>And then, as we have ta’en the sacrament,</p>

<p>We will unite the white rose and the red;</p>

<p>Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,</p>

<p>That long have frowned upon their enmity.</p>

<p>What traitor hears me and says not “Amen”?</p>

<p>England hath long been mad and scarred herself:</p>

<p>The brother blindly shed the brother’s blood;</p>

<p>The father rashly slaughtered his own son;</p>

<p>The son, compelled, been butcher to the sire.</p>

<p>All this divided York and Lancaster,</p>

<p>Divided in their dire division.</p>

<p>O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,</p>

<p>The true succeeders of each royal house,</p>

<p>By God’s fair ordinance conjoin together,</p>

<p>And let their heirs, God, if Thy will be so,</p>

<p>Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,</p>

<p>With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days.</p>

<p>Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,</p>

<p>That would reduce these bloody days again</p>

<p>And make poor England weep in streams of blood.</p>

<p>Let them not live to taste this land’s increase,</p>

<p>That would with treason wound this fair land’s peace.</p>

<p>Now civil wounds are stopped, peace lives again.</p>

<p>That she may long live here, God say amen.</p>
