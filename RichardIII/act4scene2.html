<p><center><i>[Sound a sennet. Enter Richard in pomp; Buckingham,</p>

<p>Catesby, Ratcliffe, Lovell, and others, including a Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Stand all apart.–Cousin of Buckingham.</p>

<p><center><i>[The others move aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  My gracious sovereign.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Give me thy hand.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here he ascendeth the throne. Sound trumpets.]</i></center></p>

<p>Thus high, by thy advice</p>

<p>And thy assistance is King Richard seated.</p>

<p>But shall we wear these glories for a day,</p>

<p>Or shall they last and we rejoice in them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Still live they, and forever let them last.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch,</p>

<p>To try if thou be current gold indeed:</p>

<p>Young Edward lives; think now what I would speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  Say on, my loving lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Why, Buckingham, I say I would be king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Why so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ha! Am I king? ’Tis so–but Edward lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>True, noble prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  O bitter consequence</p>

<p>That Edward still should live “true noble prince”!</p>

<p>Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.</p>

<p>Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead,</p>

<p>And I would have it suddenly performed.</p>

<p>What sayst thou now? Speak suddenly. Be brief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  Your Grace may do your pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.</p>

<p>Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Give me some little breath, some pause, dear lord,</p>

<p>Before I positively speak in this.</p>

<p>I will resolve you herein presently.</p>

<p><center><i>[Buckingham exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc> <i>[aside to the other Attendants]</i></p>

<p>The King is angry. See, he gnaws his lip.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I will converse with iron-witted fools</p>

<p>And unrespective boys. None are for me</p>

<p>That look into me with considerate eyes.</p>

<p>High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.–</p>

<p>Boy!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc> <i>[coming forward]</i>  My lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Know’st thou not any whom corrupting gold</p>

<p>Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc></p>

<p>I know a discontented gentleman</p>

<p>Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.</p>

<p>Gold were as good as twenty orators,</p>

<p>And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>What is his name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I partly know the man. Go, call him hither, boy.</p>

<p><center><i>[Page exits.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> The deep-revolving witty Buckingham</p>

<p>No more shall be the neighbor to my counsels.</p>

<p>Hath he so long held out with me, untired,</p>

<p>And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Stanley.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Lord Stanley, what’s the news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc>  Know, my loving lord,</p>

<p>The Marquess Dorset, as I hear, is fled</p>

<p>To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.</p>

<p><center><i>[He walks aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Come hither, Catesby. Rumor it abroad</p>

<p>That Anne my wife is very grievous sick.</p>

<p>I will take order for her keeping close.</p>

<p>Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,</p>

<p>Whom I will marry straight to Clarence’ daughter.</p>

<p>The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.</p>

<p>Look how thou dream’st! I say again, give out</p>

<p>That Anne my queen is sick and like to die.</p>

<p>About it, for it stands me much upon</p>

<p>To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Catesby exits.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> I must be married to my brother’s daughter,</p>

<p>Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.</p>

<p>Murder her brothers, and then marry her–</p>

<p>Uncertain way of gain. But I am in</p>

<p>So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.</p>

<p>Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Tyrrel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Is thy name Tyrrel?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tyrrel</sc></p>

<p>James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Art thou indeed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tyrrel</sc>  Prove me, my gracious lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tyrrel</sc></p>

<p>Please you. But I had rather kill two enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Why then, thou hast it. Two deep enemies,</p>

<p>Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep’s disturbers,</p>

<p>Are they that I would have thee deal upon.</p>

<p>Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tyrrel</sc></p>

<p>Let me have open means to come to them,</p>

<p>And soon I’ll rid you from the fear of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Thou sing’st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel.</p>

<p><center><i>[Tyrrel approaches Richard and kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear.</p>

<p><center><i>[Tyrrel rises, and Richard whispers</p>

<p>to him. Then Tyrrel steps back.]</i></center></p>

<p>There is no more but so. Say it is done,</p>

<p>And I will love thee and prefer thee for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tyrrel</sc>  I will dispatch it straight.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Buckingham.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I have considered in my mind</p>

<p>The late request that you did sound me in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to Richmond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  I hear the news, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Stanley, he is your wife’s son. Well, look unto it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,</p>

<p>For which your honor and your faith is pawned–</p>

<p>Th’ earldom of Hereford and the movables</p>

<p>Which you have promised I shall possess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Stanley, look to your wife. If she convey</p>

<p>Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>What says your Highness to my just request?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I do remember me, Henry the Sixth</p>

<p>Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,</p>

<p>When Richmond was a little peevish boy.</p>

<p>A king perhaps–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  My lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>How chance the prophet could not at that time</p>

<p>Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>My lord, your promise for the earldom–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,</p>

<p>The Mayor in courtesy showed me the castle</p>

<p>And called it Rougemont, at which name I started,</p>

<p>Because a bard of Ireland told me once</p>

<p>I should not live long after I saw Richmond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  My lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Ay, what’s o’clock?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind</p>

<p>Of what you promised me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Well, but what’s o’clock?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  Upon the stroke of ten.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Well, let it strike.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  Why let it strike?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Because that, like a jack, thou keep’st the stroke</p>

<p>Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.</p>

<p>I am not in the giving vein today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Why then, resolve me whether you will or no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits, and is followed by all but Buckingham.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>And is it thus? Repays he my deep service</p>

<p>With such contempt? Made I him king for this?</p>

<p>O, let me think on Hastings and be gone</p>

<p>To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
