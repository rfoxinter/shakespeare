<p><center><i>[The trumpets sound. Enter young Prince Edward,</p>

<p>Richard Duke of Gloucester, Buckingham,</p>

<p>the Cardinal, Catesby, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[to Prince]</i></p>

<p>Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts’ sovereign.</p>

<p>The weary way hath made you melancholy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>No, uncle, but our crosses on the way</p>

<p>Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.</p>

<p>I want more uncles here to welcome me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years</p>

<p>Hath not yet dived into the world’s deceit;</p>

<p>Nor more can you distinguish of a man</p>

<p>Than of his outward show, which, God He knows,</p>

<p>Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.</p>

<p>Those uncles which you want were dangerous.</p>

<p>Your Grace attended to their sugared words</p>

<p>But looked not on the poison of their hearts.</p>

<p>God keep you from them, and from such false</p>

<p>friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>God keep me from false friends, but they were none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Mayor with others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mayor</sc></p>

<p>God bless your Grace with health and happy days.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.–</p>

<p>I thought my mother and my brother York</p>

<p>Would long ere this have met us on the way.</p>

<p>Fie, what a slug is Hastings that he comes not</p>

<p>To tell us whether they will come or no!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Hastings.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>And in good time here comes the sweating lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>On what occasion God He knows, not I,</p>

<p>The Queen your mother and your brother York</p>

<p>Have taken sanctuary. The tender prince</p>

<p>Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,</p>

<p>But by his mother was perforce withheld.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Fie, what an indirect and peevish course</p>

<p>Is this of hers!–Lord Cardinal, will your Grace</p>

<p>Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York</p>

<p>Unto his princely brother presently?–</p>

<p>If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,</p>

<p>And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>My lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory</p>

<p>Can from his mother win the Duke of York,</p>

<p>Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate</p>

<p>To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid</p>

<p>We should infringe the holy privilege</p>

<p>Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land</p>

<p>Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>You are too senseless obstinate, my lord,</p>

<p>Too ceremonious and traditional.</p>

<p>Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,</p>

<p>You break not sanctuary in seizing him.</p>

<p>The benefit thereof is always granted</p>

<p>To those whose dealings have deserved the place</p>

<p>And those who have the wit to claim the place.</p>

<p>This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it</p>

<p>And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.</p>

<p>Then taking him from thence that is not there,</p>

<p>You break no privilege nor charter there.</p>

<p>Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,</p>

<p>But sanctuary children, never till now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>My lord, you shall o’errule my mind for once.–</p>

<p>Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc>  I go, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Cardinal and Hastings exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,</p>

<p>Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Where it seems best unto your royal self.</p>

<p>If I may counsel you, some day or two</p>

<p>Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower;</p>

<p>Then where you please and shall be thought most fit</p>

<p>For your best health and recreation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>I do not like the Tower, of any place.–</p>

<p>Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,</p>

<p>Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Is it upon record, or else reported</p>

<p>Successively from age to age, he built it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  Upon record, my gracious lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>But say, my lord, it were not registered,</p>

<p>Methinks the truth should live from age to age,</p>

<p>As ’twere retailed to all posterity,</p>

<p>Even to the general all-ending day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>So wise so young, they say, do never live long.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What say you, uncle?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I say, without characters fame lives long.</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> Thus, like the formal Vice, Iniquity,</p>

<p>I moralize two meanings in one word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>That Julius Caesar was a famous man.</p>

<p>With what his valor did enrich his wit,</p>

<p>His wit set down to make his valor live.</p>

<p>Death makes no conquest of this conqueror,</p>

<p>For now he lives in fame, though not in life.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  What, my gracious lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>An if I live until I be a man,</p>

<p>I’ll win our ancient right in France again</p>

<p>Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Short summers lightly have a forward spring.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter young Duke of York, Hastings, and the</p>

<p>Cardinal.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Now in good time here comes the Duke of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Well, my dread lord–so must I call you now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours.</p>

<p>Too late he died that might have kept that title,</p>

<p>Which by his death hath lost much majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>How fares our cousin, noble lord of York?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>I thank you, gentle uncle. O my lord,</p>

<p>You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.</p>

<p>The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>He hath, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc>  And therefore is he idle?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>O my fair cousin, I must not say so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Then he is more beholding to you than I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>He may command me as my sovereign,</p>

<p>But you have power in me as in a kinsman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  A beggar, brother?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,</p>

<p>And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>A greater gift? O, that’s the sword to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>O, then I see you will part but with light gifts.</p>

<p>In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>What, would you have my weapon, little lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>I would, that I might thank you as you call me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  How?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc>  Little.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>My lord of York will still be cross in talk.</p>

<p>Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.–</p>

<p>Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me.</p>

<p>Because that I am little, like an ape,</p>

<p>He thinks that you should bear me on your</p>

<p>shoulders.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!</p>

<p>To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,</p>

<p>He prettily and aptly taunts himself.</p>

<p>So cunning and so young is wonderful.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[to Prince]</i></p>

<p>My lord, will ’t please you pass along?</p>

<p>Myself and my good cousin Buckingham</p>

<p>Will to your mother, to entreat of her</p>

<p>To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc> <i>[to Prince]</i></p>

<p>What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>My Lord Protector needs will have it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Why, what should you fear?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Marry, my uncle Clarence’ angry ghost.</p>

<p>My grandam told me he was murdered there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I fear no uncles dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Nor none that live, I hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>An if they live, I hope I need not fear.</p>

<p><i>[To York.]</i> But come, my lord. With a heavy heart,</p>

<p>Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.</p>

<p><center><i>[A sennet. Prince Edward, the Duke of York,</p>

<p>and Hastings exit. Richard, Buckingham,</p>

<p>and Catesby remain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc> <i>[to Richard]</i></p>

<p>Think you, my lord, this little prating York</p>

<p>Was not incensed by his subtle mother</p>

<p>To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>No doubt, no doubt. O, ’tis a parlous boy,</p>

<p>Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.</p>

<p>He is all the mother’s, from the top to toe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Well, let them rest.–Come hither, Catesby.</p>

<p>Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend</p>

<p>As closely to conceal what we impart.</p>

<p>Thou knowest our reasons, urged upon the way.</p>

<p>What thinkest thou? Is it not an easy matter</p>

<p>To make William Lord Hastings of our mind</p>

<p>For the installment of this noble duke</p>

<p>In the seat royal of this famous isle?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>He, for his father’s sake, so loves the Prince</p>

<p>That he will not be won to aught against him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>What think’st thou then of Stanley? Will not he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>He will do all in all as Hastings doth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,</p>

<p>And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings</p>

<p>How he doth stand affected to our purpose</p>

<p>And summon him tomorrow to the Tower</p>

<p>To sit about the coronation.</p>

<p>If thou dost find him tractable to us,</p>

<p>Encourage him and tell him all our reasons.</p>

<p>If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,</p>

<p>Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,</p>

<p>And give us notice of his inclination;</p>

<p>For we tomorrow hold divided councils,</p>

<p>Wherein thyself shalt highly be employed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Commend me to Lord William. Tell him, Catesby,</p>

<p>His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries</p>

<p>Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle,</p>

<p>And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,</p>

<p>Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>My good lords both, with all the heed I can.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc>  You shall, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>At Crosby House, there shall you find us both.</p>

<p><center><i>[Catesby exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Now, my lord, what shall we do if we perceive</p>

<p>Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Chop off his head. Something we will determine.</p>

<p>And look when I am king, claim thou of me</p>

<p>The earldom of Hereford, and all the movables</p>

<p>Whereof the King my brother was possessed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>I’ll claim that promise at your Grace’s hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>And look to have it yielded with all kindness.</p>

<p>Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards</p>

<p>We may digest our complots in some form.</p>
