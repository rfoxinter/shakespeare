<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King Edward, sick, Queen Elizabeth,</p>

<p>Lord Marquess Dorset, Rivers, Hastings, Buckingham,</p>

<p>Woodeville, Grey, and Scales.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Why, so. Now have I done a good day’s work.</p>

<p>You peers, continue this united league.</p>

<p>I every day expect an embassage</p>

<p>From my Redeemer to redeem me hence,</p>

<p>And more in peace my soul shall part to heaven</p>

<p>Since I have made my friends at peace on Earth.</p>

<p>Rivers and Hastings, take each other’s hand.</p>

<p>Dissemble not your hatred. Swear your love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc> <i>[taking Hastings’ hand]</i></p>

<p>By heaven, my soul is purged from grudging hate,</p>

<p>And with my hand I seal my true heart’s love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>So thrive I as I truly swear the like.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Take heed you dally not before your king,</p>

<p>Lest He that is the supreme King of kings</p>

<p>Confound your hidden falsehood and award</p>

<p>Either of you to be the other’s end.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>So prosper I as I swear perfect love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc></p>

<p>And I as I love Hastings with my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>Madam, yourself is not exempt from this,–</p>

<p>Nor you, son Dorset,–Buckingham, nor you.</p>

<p>You have been factious one against the other.–</p>

<p>Wife, love Lord Hastings. Let him kiss your hand,</p>

<p>And what you do, do it unfeignedly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>There, Hastings, I will never more remember</p>

<p>Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine.</p>

<p><center><i>[Hastings kisses her hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Dorset, embrace him.–Hastings, love Lord</p>

<p>Marquess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorset</sc></p>

<p>This interchange of love, I here protest,</p>

<p>Upon my part shall be inviolable.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc>  And so swear I.     <i><i>[They embrace.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league</p>

<p>With thy embracements to my wife’s allies</p>

<p>And make me happy in your unity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate</p>

<p>Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love</p>

<p>Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me</p>

<p>With hate in those where I expect most love.</p>

<p>When I have most need to employ a friend,</p>

<p>And most assured that he is a friend,</p>

<p>Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile</p>

<p>Be he unto me: this do I beg of God,</p>

<p>When I am cold in love to you or yours.</p>

<p><center><i>[Queen Elizabeth and Buckingham embrace.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,</p>

<p>Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.</p>

<p>There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here</p>

<p>To make the blessed period of this peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  And in good time</p>

<p>Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ratcliffe, and Richard, Duke of Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen,</p>

<p>And, princely peers, a happy time of day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Happy indeed, as we have spent the day.</p>

<p>Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,</p>

<p>Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,</p>

<p>Between these swelling, wrong-incensed peers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>A blessed labor, my most sovereign lord.</p>

<p>Among this princely heap, if any here</p>

<p>By false intelligence or wrong surmise</p>

<p>Hold me a foe,</p>

<p>If I unwittingly, or in my rage,</p>

<p>Have aught committed that is hardly borne</p>

<p>By any in this presence, I desire</p>

<p>To reconcile me to his friendly peace.</p>

<p>’Tis death to me to be at enmity;</p>

<p>I hate it, and desire all good men’s love.</p>

<p>First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,</p>

<p>Which I will purchase with my duteous service;–</p>

<p>Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,</p>

<p>If ever any grudge were lodged between us;–</p>

<p>Of you and you, Lord Rivers and of Dorset,</p>

<p>That all without desert have frowned on me;–</p>

<p>Of you, Lord Woodeville and Lord Scales;–of you,</p>

<p>Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.</p>

<p>I do not know that Englishman alive</p>

<p>With whom my soul is any jot at odds</p>

<p>More than the infant that is born tonight.</p>

<p>I thank my God for my humility.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.</p>

<p>I would to God all strifes were well compounded.</p>

<p>My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness</p>

<p>To take our brother Clarence to your grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Why, madam, have I offered love for this,</p>

<p>To be so flouted in this royal presence?</p>

<p>Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?</p>

<p><center><i>[They all start.]</i></center></p>

<p>You do him injury to scorn his corse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Who knows not he is dead! Who knows he is?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorset</sc></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord, and no man in the presence</p>

<p>But his red color hath forsook his cheeks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Is Clarence dead? The order was reversed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>But he, poor man, by your first order died,</p>

<p>And that a winged Mercury did bear.</p>

<p>Some tardy cripple bare the countermand,</p>

<p>That came too lag to see him buried.</p>

<p>God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,</p>

<p>Nearer in bloody thoughts, and not in blood,</p>

<p>Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,</p>

<p>And yet go current from suspicion.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>A boon, my sovereign, for my service done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>I prithee, peace. My soul is full of sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>I will not rise unless your Highness hear me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Then say at once what is it thou requests.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant’s life,</p>

<p>Who slew today a riotous gentleman</p>

<p>Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Edward</sc></p>

<p>Have I a tongue to doom my brother’s death,</p>

<p>And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?</p>

<p>My brother killed no man; his fault was thought,</p>

<p>And yet his punishment was bitter death.</p>

<p>Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,</p>

<p>Kneeled at my feet, and bade me be advised?</p>

<p>Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?</p>

<p>Who told me how the poor soul did forsake</p>

<p>The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?</p>

<p>Who told me, in the field at Tewkesbury,</p>

<p>When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,</p>

<p>And said “Dear brother, live, and be a king”?</p>

<p>Who told me, when we both lay in the field</p>

<p>Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me</p>

<p>Even in his garments and did give himself,</p>

<p>All thin and naked, to the numb-cold night?</p>

<p>All this from my remembrance brutish wrath</p>

<p>Sinfully plucked, and not a man of you</p>

<p>Had so much grace to put it in my mind.</p>

<p>But when your carters or your waiting vassals</p>

<p>Have done a drunken slaughter and defaced</p>

<p>The precious image of our dear Redeemer,</p>

<p>You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon,</p>

<p>And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Stanley rises.]</i></center></p>

<p>But for my brother, not a man would speak,</p>

<p>Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself</p>

<p>For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all</p>

<p>Have been beholding to him in his life,</p>

<p>Yet none of you would once beg for his life.</p>

<p>O God, I fear Thy justice will take hold</p>

<p>On me and you, and mine and yours for this!–</p>

<p>Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.–</p>

<p>Ah, poor Clarence.</p>

<p><center><i>[Some exit with King and Queen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>This is the fruits of rashness. Marked you not</p>

<p>How that the guilty kindred of the Queen</p>

<p>Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence’ death?</p>

<p>O, they did urge it still unto the King.</p>

<p>God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go</p>

<p>To comfort Edward with our company?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  We wait upon your Grace.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
