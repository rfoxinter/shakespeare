<p><center><i>[Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester, alone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Now is the winter of our discontent</p>

<p>Made glorious summer by this son of York,</p>

<p>And all the clouds that loured upon our house</p>

<p>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</p>

<p>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,</p>

<p>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,</p>

<p>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,</p>

<p>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</p>

<p>Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;</p>

<p>And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds</p>

<p>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</p>

<p>He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber</p>

<p>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</p>

<p>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</p>

<p>Nor made to court an amorous looking glass;</p>

<p>I, that am rudely stamped and want love’s majesty</p>

<p>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</p>

<p>I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,</p>

<p>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</p>

<p>Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time</p>

<p>Into this breathing world scarce half made up,</p>

<p>And that so lamely and unfashionable</p>

<p>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them–</p>

<p>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</p>

<p>Have no delight to pass away the time,</p>

<p>Unless to see my shadow in the sun</p>

<p>And descant on mine own deformity.</p>

<p>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover</p>

<p>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</p>

<p>I am determined to prove a villain</p>

<p>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</p>

<p>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</p>

<p>By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,</p>

<p>To set my brother Clarence and the King</p>

<p>In deadly hate, the one against the other;</p>

<p>And if King Edward be as true and just</p>

<p>As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,</p>

<p>This day should Clarence closely be mewed up</p>

<p>About a prophecy which says that “G”</p>

<p>Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.</p>

<p>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence</p>

<p>comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brakenbury.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Brother, good day. What means this armed guard</p>

<p>That waits upon your Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clarence</sc>  His Majesty,</p>

<p>Tend’ring my person’s safety, hath appointed</p>

<p>This conduct to convey me to the Tower.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Upon what cause?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clarence</sc>  Because my name is</p>

<p>George.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.</p>

<p>He should, for that, commit your godfathers.</p>

<p>O, belike his Majesty hath some intent</p>

<p>That you should be new christened in the Tower.</p>

<p>But what’s the matter, Clarence? May I know?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clarence</sc></p>

<p>Yea, Richard, when I know, for I protest</p>

<p>As yet I do not. But, as I can learn,</p>

<p>He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,</p>

<p>And from the crossrow plucks the letter G,</p>

<p>And says a wizard told him that by “G”</p>

<p>His issue disinherited should be.</p>

<p>And for my name of George begins with G,</p>

<p>It follows in his thought that I am he.</p>

<p>These, as I learn, and such like toys as these</p>

<p>Hath moved his Highness to commit me now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Why, this it is when men are ruled by women.</p>

<p>’Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower.</p>

<p>My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ’tis she</p>

<p>That tempers him to this extremity.</p>

<p>Was it not she and that good man of worship,</p>

<p>Anthony Woodeville, her brother there,</p>

<p>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</p>

<p>From whence this present day he is delivered?</p>

<p>We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clarence</sc></p>

<p>By heaven, I think there is no man secure</p>

<p>But the Queen’s kindred and night-walking heralds</p>

<p>That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.</p>

<p>Heard you not what an humble suppliant</p>

<p>Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Humbly complaining to her Deity</p>

<p>Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you what: I think it is our way,</p>

<p>If we will keep in favor with the King,</p>

<p>To be her men and wear her livery.</p>

<p>The jealous o’erworn widow and herself,</p>

<p>Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen,</p>

<p>Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brakenbury</sc></p>

<p>I beseech your Graces both to pardon me.</p>

<p>His Majesty hath straitly given in charge</p>

<p>That no man shall have private conference,</p>

<p>Of what degree soever, with your brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Even so. An please your Worship, Brakenbury,</p>

<p>You may partake of anything we say.</p>

<p>We speak no treason, man. We say the King</p>

<p>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</p>

<p>Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.</p>

<p>We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,</p>

<p>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue,</p>

<p>And that the Queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks.</p>

<p>How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brakenbury</sc></p>

<p>With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Naught to do with Mistress Shore? I tell thee,</p>

<p>fellow,</p>

<p>He that doth naught with her, excepting one,</p>

<p>Were best to do it secretly, alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brakenbury</sc></p>

<p>I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal</p>

<p>Forbear your conference with the noble duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clarence</sc></p>

<p>We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>We are the Queen’s abjects and must obey.–</p>

<p>Brother, farewell. I will unto the King,</p>

<p>And whatsoe’er you will employ me in,</p>

<p>Were it to call King Edward’s widow “sister,”</p>

<p>I will perform it to enfranchise you.</p>

<p>Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood</p>

<p>Touches me deeper than you can imagine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clarence</sc></p>

<p>I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Well, your imprisonment shall not be long.</p>

<p>I will deliver you or else lie for you.</p>

<p>Meantime, have patience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clarence</sc>  I must, perforce. Farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[Exit Clarence, Brakenbury, and guard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Go tread the path that thou shalt ne’er return.</p>

<p>Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so</p>

<p>That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,</p>

<p>If heaven will take the present at our hands.</p>

<p>But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Hastings.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>Good time of day unto my gracious lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain.</p>

<p>Well are you welcome to the open air.</p>

<p>How hath your Lordship brooked imprisonment?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.</p>

<p>But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks</p>

<p>That were the cause of my imprisonment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too,</p>

<p>For they that were your enemies are his</p>

<p>And have prevailed as much on him as you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>More pity that the eagles should be mewed,</p>

<p>Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  What news abroad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>No news so bad abroad as this at home:</p>

<p>The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,</p>

<p>And his physicians fear him mightily.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.</p>

<p>O, he hath kept an evil diet long,</p>

<p>And overmuch consumed his royal person.</p>

<p>’Tis very grievous to be thought upon.</p>

<p>Where is he, in his bed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc>  He is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Go you before, and I will follow you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Exit Hastings.]</i></center></p>

<p>He cannot live, I hope, and must not die</p>

<p>Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven.</p>

<p>I’ll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence</p>

<p>With lies well steeled with weighty arguments,</p>

<p>And, if I fail not in my deep intent,</p>

<p>Clarence hath not another day to live;</p>

<p>Which done, God take King Edward to His mercy,</p>

<p>And leave the world for me to bustle in.</p>

<p>For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter.</p>

<p>What though I killed her husband and her father?</p>

<p>The readiest way to make the wench amends</p>

<p>Is to become her husband and her father;</p>

<p>The which will I, not all so much for love</p>

<p>As for another secret close intent</p>

<p>By marrying her which I must reach unto.</p>

<p>But yet I run before my horse to market.</p>

<p>Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns.</p>

<p>When they are gone, then must I count my gains.</p>
