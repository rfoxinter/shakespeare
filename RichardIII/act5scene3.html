<p><center><i>[Enter King Richard, in arms, with Norfolk, Ratcliffe, and</p>

<p>the Earl of Surrey, with Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth field.</p>

<p><center><i>[Soldiers begin to pitch the tent.]</i></center></p>

<p>My lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc></p>

<p>My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>My lord of Norfolk–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  Here, most gracious liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Norfolk, we must have knocks, ha, must we not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc></p>

<p>We must both give and take, my loving lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Up with my tent!–Here will I lie tonight.</p>

<p>But where tomorrow? Well, all’s one for that.</p>

<p>Who hath descried the number of the traitors?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc></p>

<p>Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Why, our battalia trebles that account.</p>

<p>Besides, the King’s name is a tower of strength</p>

<p>Which they upon the adverse faction want.–</p>

<p>Up with the tent!–Come, noble gentlemen,</p>

<p>Let us survey the vantage of the ground.</p>

<p>Call for some men of sound direction;</p>

<p>Let’s lack no discipline, make no delay,</p>

<p>For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.</p>

<p><center><i>[The tent now in place, they exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Richmond, Sir William Brandon, Oxford,</p>

<p>Dorset, Herbert, Blunt, and others who set up</p>

<p>Richmond’s tent.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richmond</sc></p>

<p>The weary sun hath made a golden set,</p>

<p>And by the bright track of his fiery car</p>

<p>Gives token of a goodly day tomorrow.–</p>

<p>Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.–</p>

<p>Give me some ink and paper in my tent;</p>

<p>I’ll draw the form and model of our battle,</p>

<p>Limit each leader to his several charge,</p>

<p>And part in just proportion our small power.–</p>

<p>My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,</p>

<p>And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.</p>

<p>The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment.–</p>

<p>Good Captain Blunt, bear my goodnight to him,</p>

<p>And by the second hour in the morning</p>

<p>Desire the Earl to see me in my tent.</p>

<p>Yet one thing more, good captain, do for me.</p>

<p>Where is Lord Stanley quartered, do you know?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blunt</sc></p>

<p>Unless I have mista’en his colors much,</p>

<p>Which well I am assured I have not done,</p>

<p>His regiment lies half a mile, at least,</p>

<p>South from the mighty power of the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richmond</sc></p>

<p>If without peril it be possible,</p>

<p>Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with</p>

<p>him,</p>

<p>And give him from me this most needful note.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blunt</sc></p>

<p>Upon my life, my lord, I’ll undertake it,</p>

<p>And so God give you quiet rest tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richmond</sc></p>

<p>Good night, good Captain Blunt.     <i><i>[Blunt exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Come, gentlemen,</p>

<p>Let us consult upon tomorrow’s business.</p>

<p>Into my tent. The dew is raw and cold.</p>

<p><center><i>[Richmond, Brandon, Dorset, Herbert, and Oxford</p>

<p>withdraw into the tent. The others exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter to his tent Richard, Ratcliffe, Norfolk, and</p>

<p>Catesby, with Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  What is ’t o’clock?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>It’s suppertime, my lord. It’s nine o’clock.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I will not sup tonight. Give me some ink and paper.</p>

<p>What, is my beaver easier than it was,</p>

<p>And all my armor laid into my tent?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>It is, my liege, and all things are in readiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge.</p>

<p>Use careful watch. Choose trusty sentinels.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  I go, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Stir with the lark tomorrow, gentle Norfolk.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  I warrant you, my lord.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Catesby.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc>  My lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Send out a pursuivant-at-arms</p>

<p>To Stanley’s regiment. Bid him bring his power</p>

<p>Before sunrising, lest his son George fall</p>

<p>Into the blind cave of eternal night.     <i><i>[Catesby exits.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[To Soldiers.]</i> Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a</p>

<p>watch.</p>

<p>Saddle white Surrey for the field tomorrow.</p>

<p>Look that my staves be sound and not too heavy.–</p>

<p>Ratcliffe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc>  My lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Sawst thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc></p>

<p>Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,</p>

<p>Much about cockshut time, from troop to troop</p>

<p>Went through the army cheering up the soldiers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine.</p>

<p>I have not that alacrity of spirit</p>

<p>Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.</p>

<p><center><i>[Wine is brought.]</i></center></p>

<p>Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc></p>

<p>It is, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Bid my guard watch. Leave me.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, about the mid of night come to my tent</p>

<p>And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.</p>

<p><center><i>[Ratcliffe exits. Richard sleeps in his tent,</p>

<p>which is guarded by Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Stanley, Earl of Derby to Richmond in his tent.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richmond</sc></p>

<p>All comfort that the dark night can afford</p>

<p>Be to thy person, noble father-in-law.</p>

<p>Tell me, how fares our loving mother?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</p>

<p>Who prays continually for Richmond’s good.</p>

<p>So much for that. The silent hours steal on,</p>

<p>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</p>

<p>In brief, for so the season bids us be,</p>

<p>Prepare thy battle early in the morning,</p>

<p>And put thy fortune to the arbitrament</p>

<p>Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.</p>

<p>I, as I may–that which I would I cannot–</p>

<p>With best advantage will deceive the time</p>

<p>And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms.</p>

<p>But on thy side I may not be too forward,</p>

<p>Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,</p>

<p>Be executed in his father’s sight.</p>

<p>Farewell. The leisure and the fearful time</p>

<p>Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love</p>

<p>And ample interchange of sweet discourse,</p>

<p>Which so-long-sundered friends should dwell upon.</p>

<p>God give us leisure for these rites of love!</p>

<p>Once more, adieu. Be valiant and speed well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richmond</sc></p>

<p>Good lords, conduct him to his regiment.</p>

<p>I’ll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap,</p>

<p>Lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow</p>

<p>When I should mount with wings of victory.</p>

<p>Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[All but Richmond leave his tent and exit.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Richmond kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>O Thou, whose captain I account myself,</p>

<p>Look on my forces with a gracious eye.</p>

<p>Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath,</p>

<p>That they may crush down with a heavy fall</p>

<p>The usurping helmets of our adversaries.</p>

<p>Make us Thy ministers of chastisement,</p>

<p>That we may praise Thee in the victory.</p>

<p>To Thee I do commend my watchful soul,</p>

<p>Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.</p>

<p>Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!     <i><i>[Sleeps.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Ghost of young Prince Edward, son to Harry</p>

<p>the Sixth.]</i></center></p>

<p>Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow.</p>

<p>Think how thou stabbed’st me in my prime of</p>

<p>youth</p>

<p>At Tewkesbury. Despair therefore, and die!</p>

<p><i>[(To Richmond.)]</i> Be cheerful, Richmond, for the</p>

<p>I, that was washed to death with fulsome wine,</p>

<p>Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death.</p>

<p>Tomorrow in the battle think on me,</p>

<p>And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die!</p>

<p>Rivers, that died at Pomfret. Despair and die!</p>

<p>Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death.</p>

<p>Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath.</p>

<p><i>[(To Richmond.)]</i> I died for hope ere I could lend</p>

<p><center><i>[Richard starteth up out of a dream.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Give me another horse! Bind up my wounds!</p>

<p>Have mercy, Jesu!–Soft, I did but dream.</p>

<p>O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!</p>

<p>The lights burn blue; it is now dead midnight.</p>

<p>Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.</p>

<p>What do I fear? Myself? There’s none else by.</p>

<p>Richard loves Richard, that is, I am I.</p>

<p>Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Then fly! What, from myself? Great reason why:</p>

<p>Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?</p>

<p>Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good</p>

<p>That I myself have done unto myself?</p>

<p>O, no. Alas, I rather hate myself</p>

<p>For hateful deeds committed by myself.</p>

<p>I am a villain. Yet I lie; I am not.</p>

<p>Fool, of thyself speak well. Fool, do not flatter.</p>

<p>My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,</p>

<p>And every tongue brings in a several tale,</p>

<p>And every tale condemns me for a villain.</p>

<p>Perjury, perjury, in the highest degree;</p>

<p>Murder, stern murder, in the direst degree;</p>

<p>All several sins, all used in each degree,</p>

<p>Throng to the bar, crying all “Guilty, guilty!”</p>

<p>I shall despair. There is no creature loves me,</p>

<p>And if I die no soul will pity me.</p>

<p>And wherefore should they, since that I myself</p>

<p>Find in myself no pity to myself?</p>

<p>Methought the souls of all that I had murdered</p>

<p>Came to my tent, and every one did threat</p>

<p>Tomorrow’s vengeance on the head of Richard.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ratcliffe.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc>  My lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Zounds, who is there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc></p>

<p>Ratcliffe, my lord, ’tis I. The early village cock</p>

<p>Hath twice done salutation to the morn.</p>

<p>Your friends are up and buckle on their armor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>O Ratcliffe, I have dreamed a fearful dream!</p>

<p>What think’st thou, will our friends prove all true?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc></p>

<p>No doubt, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  O Ratcliffe, I fear, I fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc></p>

<p>Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight</p>

<p>Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard</p>

<p>Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers</p>

<p>Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.</p>

<p>’Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me.</p>

<p>Under our tents I’ll play the eavesdropper</p>

<p>To see if any mean to shrink from me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Richard and Ratcliffe exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Lords to Richmond, in his tent.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lords</sc>  Good morrow, Richmond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richmond</sc></p>

<p>Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,</p>

<p>That you have ta’en a tardy sluggard here.</p>

<br/>

<p>A <sc>Lord</sc>  How have you slept, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richmond</sc></p>

<p>The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams</p>

<p>That ever entered in a drowsy head</p>

<p>Have I since your departure had, my lords.</p>

<p>Methought their souls whose bodies Richard</p>

<p>murdered</p>

<p>Came to my tent and cried on victory.</p>

<p>I promise you, my soul is very jocund</p>

<p>In the remembrance of so fair a dream.</p>

<p>How far into the morning is it, lords?</p>

<br/>

<p>A <sc>Lord</sc>  Upon the stroke of four.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richmond</sc> <i>[leaving the tent]</i></p>

<p>Why, then ’tis time to arm and give direction.</p>

<br/>

<p>His oration to his soldiers.</p>

<br/>

<p>More than I have said, loving countrymen,</p>

<p>The leisure and enforcement of the time</p>

<p>Forbids to dwell upon. Yet remember this:</p>

<p>God, and our good cause, fight upon our side.</p>

<p>The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,</p>

<p>Like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces.</p>

<p>Richard except, those whom we fight against</p>

<p>Had rather have us win than him they follow.</p>

<p>For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,</p>

<p>A bloody tyrant and a homicide;</p>

<p>One raised in blood, and one in blood established;</p>

<p>One that made means to come by what he hath,</p>

<p>And slaughtered those that were the means to help</p>

<p>him;</p>

<p>A base foul stone, made precious by the foil</p>

<p>Of England’s chair, where he is falsely set;</p>

<p>One that hath ever been God’s enemy.</p>

<p>Then if you fight against God’s enemy,</p>

<p>God will, in justice, ward you as his soldiers.</p>

<p>If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,</p>

<p>You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain.</p>

<p>If you do fight against your country’s foes,</p>

<p>Your country’s fat shall pay your pains the hire.</p>

<p>If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,</p>

<p>Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors.</p>

<p>If you do free your children from the sword,</p>

<p>Your children’s children quits it in your age.</p>

<p>Then, in the name of God and all these rights,</p>

<p>Advance your standards; draw your willing swords.</p>

<p>For me, the ransom of my bold attempt</p>

<p>Shall be this cold corpse on the Earth’s cold face,</p>

<p>But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt</p>

<p>The least of you shall share his part thereof.</p>

<p>Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully.</p>

<p>God, and Saint George, Richmond, and victory!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc></p>

<p>That he was never trained up in arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>He said the truth. And what said Surrey then?</p>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc></p>

<p>He smiled and said “The better for our purpose.”</p>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.</p>

<p>This, and Saint George to boot!–What think’st</p>

<p>thou, Norfolk?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc></p>

<p>A good direction, warlike sovereign.</p>

<p><center><i>[He sheweth him a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>This found I on my tent this morning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[reads]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold.</i></p>

<p>     <i>For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.</i></p>

<p>A thing devised by the enemy.–</p>

<p>Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge.</p>

<p>Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls.</p>

<p>Conscience is but a word that cowards use,</p>

<p>Devised at first to keep the strong in awe.</p>

<p>Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.</p>

<p>March on. Join bravely. Let us to it pell mell,</p>

<p>If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.</p>

<br/>

<p>His oration to his army.</p>

<br/>

<p>What shall I say more than I have inferred?</p>

<p>Remember whom you are to cope withal,</p>

<p>A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,</p>

<p>A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants,</p>

<p>Whom their o’ercloyed country vomits forth</p>

<p>To desperate adventures and assured destruction.</p>

<p>You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;</p>

<p>You having lands and blessed with beauteous wives,</p>

<p>They would restrain the one, distain the other.</p>

<p>And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,</p>

<p>Long kept in Brittany at our mother’s cost,</p>

<p>A milksop, one that never in his life</p>

<p>Felt so much cold as overshoes in snow?</p>

<p>Let’s whip these stragglers o’er the seas again,</p>

<p>Lash hence these overweening rags of France,</p>

<p>These famished beggars weary of their lives,</p>

<p>Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,</p>

<p>For want of means, poor rats, had hanged</p>

<p>themselves.</p>

<p>If we be conquered, let men conquer us,</p>

<p>And not these bastard Bretons, whom our fathers</p>

<p>Have in their own land beaten, bobbed, and</p>

<p>thumped,</p>

<p>And in record left them the heirs of shame.</p>

<p>Shall these enjoy our lands, lie with our wives,</p>

<p>Ravish our daughters?     <i><i>[Drum afar off.]</i></i></p>

<p>Hark, I hear their drum.</p>

<p>Fight, gentlemen of England.–Fight, bold</p>

<p>yeomen.–</p>

<p>Draw, archers; draw your arrows to the head.–</p>

<p>Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood.</p>

<p>Amaze the welkin with your broken staves.–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  My lord, he doth deny to come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Off with his son George’s head!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc></p>

<p>My lord, the enemy is past the marsh.</p>

<p>After the battle let George Stanley die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>A thousand hearts are great within my bosom.</p>

<p>Advance our standards. Set upon our foes.</p>

<p>Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,</p>

<p>Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons.</p>

<p>Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
