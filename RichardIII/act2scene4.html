<p><center><i>[Enter Archbishop, the young Duke of York,</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth, and the Duchess of York.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Archbishop</sc></p>

<p>Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,</p>

<p>And at Northampton they do rest tonight.</p>

<p>Tomorrow or next day they will be here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>I long with all my heart to see the Prince.</p>

<p>I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>But I hear no; they say my son of York</p>

<p>Has almost overta’en him in his growth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Why, my good cousin? It is good to grow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,</p>

<p>My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow</p>

<p>More than my brother. “Ay,” quoth my uncle</p>

<p>Gloucester,</p>

<p>“Small herbs have grace; great weeds do grow</p>

<p>apace.”</p>

<p>And since, methinks I would not grow so fast</p>

<p>Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make</p>

<p>haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold</p>

<p>In him that did object the same to thee!</p>

<p>He was the wretched’st thing when he was young,</p>

<p>So long a-growing and so leisurely,</p>

<p>That if his rule were true, he should be gracious.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Now, by my troth, if I had been remembered,</p>

<p>I could have given my uncle’s Grace a flout</p>

<p>To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast</p>

<p>That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.</p>

<p>’Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.</p>

<p>Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc>  Grandam, his nurse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>His nurse? Why, she was dead ere thou wast born.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>If ’twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>A parlous boy! Go to, you are too shrewd.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Good madam, be not angry with the child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc>  Pitchers have ears.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Archbishop</sc>  Here comes a messenger.–What news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc>  How doth the Prince?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  Well, madam, and in health.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc>  What is thy news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,</p>

<p>And, with them, Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc>  Who hath committed them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>The mighty dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Archbishop</sc>  For what offense?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>The sum of all I can, I have disclosed.</p>

<p>Why, or for what, the nobles were committed</p>

<p>Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Ay me! I see the ruin of my house.</p>

<p>The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind.</p>

<p>Insulting tyranny begins to jut</p>

<p>Upon the innocent and aweless throne.</p>

<p>Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre.</p>

<p>I see, as in a map, the end of all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,</p>

<p>How many of you have mine eyes beheld?</p>

<p>My husband lost his life to get the crown,</p>

<p>And often up and down my sons were tossed</p>

<p>For me to joy, and weep, their gain and loss.</p>

<p>And being seated, and domestic broils</p>

<p>Clean overblown, themselves the conquerors</p>

<p>Make war upon themselves, brother to brother,</p>

<p>Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous</p>

<p>And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen,</p>

<p>Or let me die, to look on Earth no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc> <i>[to York]</i></p>

<p>Come, come, my boy. We will to sanctuary.–</p>

<p>Madam, farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc>  Stay, I will go with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>You have no cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Archbishop</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i>  My gracious lady, go,</p>

<p>And thither bear your treasure and your goods.</p>

<p>For my part, I’ll resign unto your Grace</p>

<p>The seal I keep; and so betide to me</p>

<p>As well I tender you and all of yours.</p>

<p>Go. I’ll conduct you to the sanctuary.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
