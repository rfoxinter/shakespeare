<p><center><i>[Enter the corse of Henry the Sixth on a bier, with</p>

<p>Halberds to guard it, Lady Anne being the mourner,</p>

<p>accompanied by Gentlemen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Set down, set down your honorable load,</p>

<p>If honor may be shrouded in a hearse,</p>

<p>Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament</p>

<p>Th’ untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.</p>

<p><center><i>[They set down the bier.]</i></center></p>

<p>Poor key-cold figure of a holy king,</p>

<p>Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster,</p>

<p>Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood,</p>

<p>Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost</p>

<p>To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,</p>

<p>Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,</p>

<p>Stabbed by the selfsame hand that made these</p>

<p>wounds.</p>

<p>Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life</p>

<p>I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.</p>

<p>O, cursed be the hand that made these holes;</p>

<p>Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it;</p>

<p>Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence.</p>

<p>More direful hap betide that hated wretch</p>

<p>That makes us wretched by the death of thee</p>

<p>Than I can wish to wolves, to spiders, toads,</p>

<p>Or any creeping venomed thing that lives.</p>

<p>If ever he have child, abortive be it,</p>

<p>Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,</p>

<p>Whose ugly and unnatural aspect</p>

<p>May fright the hopeful mother at the view,</p>

<p>And that be heir to his unhappiness.</p>

<p>If ever he have wife, let her be made</p>

<p>More miserable by the death of him</p>

<p>Than I am made by my young lord and thee.–</p>

<p>Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load,</p>

<p>Taken from Paul’s to be interred there.</p>

<p><center><i>[They take up the bier.]</i></center></p>

<p>And still, as you are weary of this weight,</p>

<p>Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry’s corse.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>What black magician conjures up this fiend</p>

<p>To stop devoted charitable deeds?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Villains, set down the corse or, by Saint Paul,</p>

<p>I’ll make a corse of him that disobeys.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span></p>

<p>My lord, stand back and let the coffin pass.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Unmannered dog, stand thou when I command!–</p>

<p>Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,</p>

<p>Or by Saint Paul I’ll strike thee to my foot</p>

<p>And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.</p>

<p><center><i>[They set down the bier.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span> <i>[to the Gentlemen and Halberds]</i></p>

<p>What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?</p>

<p>Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,</p>

<p>And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.–</p>

<p>Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell.</p>

<p>Thou hadst but power over his mortal body;</p>

<p>His soul thou canst not have. Therefore begone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Foul devil, for God’s sake, hence, and trouble us</p>

<p>not,</p>

<p>For thou hast made the happy Earth thy hell,</p>

<p>Filled it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.</p>

<p>If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,</p>

<p>Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.</p>

<p><center><i>[She points to the corpse.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, gentlemen, see, see dead Henry’s wounds</p>

<p>Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh!–</p>

<p>Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,</p>

<p>For ’tis thy presence that exhales this blood</p>

<p>From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells.</p>

<p>Thy deeds, inhuman and unnatural,</p>

<p>Provokes this deluge most unnatural.–</p>

<p>O God, which this blood mad’st, revenge his death!</p>

<p>O Earth, which this blood drink’st, revenge his</p>

<p>death!</p>

<p>Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer</p>

<p>dead,</p>

<p>Or Earth gape open wide and eat him quick,</p>

<p>As thou dost swallow up this good king’s blood,</p>

<p>Which his hell-governed arm hath butchered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Lady, you know no rules of charity,</p>

<p>Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Villain, thou know’st nor law of God nor man.</p>

<p>No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>But I know none, and therefore am no beast.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>O, wonderful, when devils tell the truth!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>More wonderful, when angels are so angry.</p>

<p>Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,</p>

<p>Of these supposed crimes to give me leave</p>

<p>By circumstance but to acquit myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,</p>

<p>Of these known evils but to give me leave</p>

<p>By circumstance to curse thy cursed self.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have</p>

<p>Some patient leisure to excuse myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make</p>

<p>No excuse current but to hang thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>By such despair I should accuse myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>And by despairing shalt thou stand excused</p>

<p>For doing worthy vengeance on thyself</p>

<p>That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Say that I slew them not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  Then say they were not slain.</p>

<p>But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  I did not kill your husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  Why then, he is alive.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward’s hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>In thy foul throat thou liest. Queen Margaret saw</p>

<p>Thy murd’rous falchion smoking in his blood,</p>

<p>The which thou once didst bend against her breast,</p>

<p>But that thy brothers beat aside the point.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>I was provoked by her sland’rous tongue,</p>

<p>That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,</p>

<p>That never dream’st on aught but butcheries.</p>

<p>Didst thou not kill this king?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  I grant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me too</p>

<p>Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed.</p>

<p>O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>The better for the King of heaven that hath him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither,</p>

<p>For he was fitter for that place than Earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>And thou unfit for any place but hell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  Some dungeon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Your bedchamber.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>So will it, madam, till I lie with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>I hope so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,</p>

<p>To leave this keen encounter of our wits</p>

<p>And fall something into a slower method:</p>

<p>Is not the causer of the timeless deaths</p>

<p>Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,</p>

<p>As blameful as the executioner?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Thou wast the cause and most accursed effect.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Your beauty was the cause of that effect–</p>

<p>Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep</p>

<p>To undertake the death of all the world,</p>

<p>So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,</p>

<p>These nails should rend that beauty from my</p>

<p>cheeks.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>These eyes could not endure that beauty’s wrack.</p>

<p>You should not blemish it, if I stood by.</p>

<p>As all the world is cheered by the sun,</p>

<p>So I by that. It is my day, my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Black night o’ershade thy day, and death thy life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>I would I were, to be revenged on thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>It is a quarrel most unnatural</p>

<p>To be revenged on him that loveth thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>It is a quarrel just and reasonable</p>

<p>To be revenged on him that killed my husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband</p>

<p>Did it to help thee to a better husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>His better doth not breathe upon the earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>He lives that loves thee better than he could.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Name him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Plantagenet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  Why, that was he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>The selfsame name, but one of better nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Where is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Here. <i>[(She spits at him.)]</i> Why dost</p>

<p>thou spit at me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Would it were mortal poison for thy sake.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Never came poison from so sweet a place.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Never hung poison on a fouler toad.</p>

<p>Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Would they were basilisks’ to strike thee dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>I would they were, that I might die at once,</p>

<p>For now they kill me with a living death.</p>

<p>Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt</p>

<p>tears,</p>

<p>Shamed their aspects with store of childish drops.</p>

<p>These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear–</p>

<p>No, when my father York and Edward wept</p>

<p>To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made</p>

<p>When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;</p>

<p>Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,</p>

<p>Told the sad story of my father’s death</p>

<p>And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,</p>

<p>That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks</p>

<p>Like trees bedashed with rain–in that sad time,</p>

<p>My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;</p>

<p>And what these sorrows could not thence exhale</p>

<p>Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with</p>

<p>weeping.</p>

<p>I never sued to friend nor enemy;</p>

<p>My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word.</p>

<p>But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,</p>

<p>My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to</p>

<p>speak.     <i><i>[She looks scornfully at him.]</i></i></p>

<p>Teach not thy lip such scorn, for it was made</p>

<p>For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.</p>

<p>If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,</p>

<p>Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword,</p>

<p>Which if thou please to hide in this true breast</p>

<p>And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,</p>

<p>I lay it naked to the deadly stroke</p>

<p>And humbly beg the death upon my knee.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kneels and lays his breast open;</p>

<p>she offers at it with his sword.]</i></center></p>

<p>Nay, do not pause, for I did kill King Henry–</p>

<p>But ’twas thy beauty that provoked me.</p>

<p>Nay, now dispatch; ’twas I that stabbed young</p>

<p>Edward–</p>

<p>But ’twas thy heavenly face that set me on.</p>

<p><center><i>[She falls the sword.]</i></center></p>

<p>Take up the sword again, or take up me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Arise, dissembler. Though I wish thy death,</p>

<p>I will not be thy executioner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[rising]</i></p>

<p>Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>I have already.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  That was in thy rage.</p>

<p>Speak it again and, even with the word,</p>

<p>This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,</p>

<p>Shall for thy love kill a far truer love.</p>

<p>To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  I would I knew thy heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  ’Tis figured in my tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  I fear me both are false.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Then never was man true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  Well, well, put up your sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Say then my peace is made.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  That shalt thou know hereafter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  But shall I live in hope?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  All men I hope live so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Vouchsafe to wear this ring.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  To take is not to give.</p>

<p><center><i>[He places the ring on her hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger;</p>

<p>Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart.</p>

<p>Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.</p>

<p>And if thy poor devoted servant may</p>

<p>But beg one favor at thy gracious hand,</p>

<p>Thou dost confirm his happiness forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  What is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>That it may please you leave these sad designs</p>

<p>To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,</p>

<p>And presently repair to Crosby House,</p>

<p>Where, after I have solemnly interred</p>

<p>At Chertsey monast’ry this noble king</p>

<p>And wet his grave with my repentant tears,</p>

<p>I will with all expedient duty see you.</p>

<p>For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,</p>

<p>Grant me this boon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>With all my heart, and much it joys me too</p>

<p>To see you are become so penitent.–</p>

<p>Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Bid me farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  ’Tis more than you deserve;</p>

<p>But since you teach me how to flatter you,</p>

<p>Imagine I have said “farewell” already.</p>

<p><center><i>[Two exit with Anne. The bier is taken up.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Towards Chertsey, noble lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>No, to Whitefriars. There attend my coming.</p>

<p><center><i>[Halberds and gentlemen exit with corse.]</i></center></p>

<p>Was ever woman in this humor wooed?</p>

<p>Was ever woman in this humor won?</p>

<p>I’ll have her, but I will not keep her long.</p>

<p>What, I that killed her husband and his father,</p>

<p>To take her in her heart’s extremest hate,</p>

<p>With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,</p>

<p>The bleeding witness of my hatred by,</p>

<p>Having God, her conscience, and these bars against</p>

<p>me,</p>

<p>And I no friends to back my suit at all</p>

<p>But the plain devil and dissembling looks?</p>

<p>And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!</p>

<p>Ha!</p>

<p>Hath she forgot already that brave prince,</p>

<p>Edward, her lord, whom I some three months since</p>

<p>Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewkesbury?</p>

<p>A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,</p>

<p>Framed in the prodigality of nature,</p>

<p>Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,</p>

<p>The spacious world cannot again afford.</p>

<p>And will she yet abase her eyes on me,</p>

<p>That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince</p>

<p>And made her widow to a woeful bed?</p>

<p>On me, whose all not equals Edward’s moiety?</p>

<p>On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?</p>

<p>My dukedom to a beggarly denier,</p>

<p>I do mistake my person all this while!</p>

<p>Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,</p>

<p>Myself to be a marv’lous proper man.</p>

<p>I’ll be at charges for a looking glass</p>

<p>And entertain a score or two of tailors</p>

<p>To study fashions to adorn my body.</p>

<p>Since I am crept in favor with myself,</p>

<p>I will maintain it with some little cost.</p>

<p>But first I’ll turn yon fellow in his grave</p>

<p>And then return lamenting to my love.</p>

<p>Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,</p>

<p>That I may see my shadow as I pass.</p>
