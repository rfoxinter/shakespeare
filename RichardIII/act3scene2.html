<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger to the door of Hastings.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span> <i>[knocking]</i>  My lord, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span> <i>[within]</i>  Who knocks?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  One from the Lord Stanley.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span> <i>[within]</i>  What is ’t o’clock?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Upon the stroke of four.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Hastings.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>So it appears by that I have to say.</p>

<p>First, he commends him to your noble self.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span>  What then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Then certifies your Lordship that this night</p>

<p>He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm.</p>

<p>Besides, he says there are two councils kept,</p>

<p>And that may be determined at the one</p>

<p>Which may make you and him to rue at th’ other.</p>

<p>Therefore he sends to know your Lordship’s</p>

<p>pleasure,</p>

<p>If you will presently take horse with him</p>

<p>And with all speed post with him toward the north</p>

<p>To shun the danger that his soul divines.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Go, fellow, go. Return unto thy lord.</p>

<p>Bid him not fear the separated council.</p>

<p>His Honor and myself are at the one,</p>

<p>And at the other is my good friend Catesby,</p>

<p>Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us</p>

<p>Whereof I shall not have intelligence.</p>

<p>Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance.</p>

<p>And for his dreams, I wonder he’s so simple</p>

<p>To trust the mock’ry of unquiet slumbers.</p>

<p>To fly the boar before the boar pursues</p>

<p>Were to incense the boar to follow us</p>

<p>And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.</p>

<p>Go, bid thy master rise and come to me,</p>

<p>And we will both together to the Tower,</p>

<p>Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>I’ll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Catesby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Catesby</span></p>

<p>Many good morrows to my noble lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, Catesby. You are early stirring.</p>

<p>What news, what news in this our tott’ring state?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Catesby</span></p>

<p>It is a reeling world indeed, my lord,</p>

<p>And I believe will never stand upright</p>

<p>Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>How “wear the garland”? Dost thou mean the</p>

<p>crown?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Catesby</span>  Ay, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>I’ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders</p>

<p>Before I’ll see the crown so foul misplaced.</p>

<p>But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Catesby</span></p>

<p>Ay, on my life, and hopes to find you forward</p>

<p>Upon his party for the gain thereof;</p>

<p>And thereupon he sends you this good news,</p>

<p>That this same very day your enemies,</p>

<p>The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,</p>

<p>Because they have been still my adversaries.</p>

<p>But that I’ll give my voice on Richard’s side</p>

<p>To bar my master’s heirs in true descent,</p>

<p>God knows I will not do it, to the death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Catesby</span></p>

<p>God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,</p>

<p>That they which brought me in my master’s hate,</p>

<p>I live to look upon their tragedy.</p>

<p>Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older</p>

<p>I’ll send some packing that yet think not on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Catesby</span></p>

<p>’Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,</p>

<p>When men are unprepared and look not for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out</p>

<p>With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so ’twill do</p>

<p>With some men else that think themselves as safe</p>

<p>As thou and I, who, as thou know’st, are dear</p>

<p>To princely Richard and to Buckingham.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Catesby</span></p>

<p>The Princes both make high account of you–</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> For they account his head upon the Bridge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>I know they do, and I have well deserved it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Stanley.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Come on, come on. Where is your boar-spear, man?</p>

<p>Fear you the boar and go so unprovided?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stanley</span></p>

<p>My lord, good morrow.–Good morrow, Catesby.–</p>

<p>You may jest on, but, by the Holy Rood,</p>

<p>I do not like these several councils, I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours,</p>

<p>And never in my days, I do protest,</p>

<p>Was it so precious to me as ’tis now.</p>

<p>Think you but that I know our state secure,</p>

<p>I would be so triumphant as I am?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stanley</span></p>

<p>The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,</p>

<p>Were jocund and supposed their states were sure,</p>

<p>And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;</p>

<p>But yet you see how soon the day o’ercast.</p>

<p>This sudden stab of rancor I misdoubt.</p>

<p>Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!</p>

<p>What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Come, come. Have with you. Wot you what, my lord?</p>

<p>Today the lords you talked of are beheaded.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stanley</span></p>

<p>They, for their truth, might better wear their heads</p>

<p>Than some that have accused them wear their hats.</p>

<p>But come, my lord, let’s away.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Pursuivant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Go on before. I’ll talk with this good fellow.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lord Stanley and Catesby exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>How now, sirrah? How goes the world with thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pursuivant</span></p>

<p>The better that your Lordship please to ask.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>I tell thee, man, ’tis better with me now</p>

<p>Than when thou met’st me last where now we meet.</p>

<p>Then was I going prisoner to the Tower</p>

<p>By the suggestion of the Queen’s allies.</p>

<p>But now, I tell thee–keep it to thyself–</p>

<p>This day those enemies are put to death,</p>

<p>And I in better state than e’er I was.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pursuivant</span></p>

<p>God hold it, to your Honor’s good content!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Gramercy, fellow. There, drink that for me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Throws him his purse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pursuivant</span>  I thank your Honor.     <i><i>[Pursuivant exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Priest.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Priest</span></p>

<p>Well met, my lord. I am glad to see your Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.</p>

<p>I am in your debt for your last exercise.</p>

<p>Come the next sabbath, and I will content you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Priest</span>  I’ll wait upon your Lordship.     <i><i>[Priest exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Buckingham.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>What, talking with a priest, Lord Chamberlain?</p>

<p>Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;</p>

<p>Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Good faith, and when I met this holy man,</p>

<p>The men you talk of came into my mind.</p>

<p>What, go you toward the Tower?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there.</p>

<p>I shall return before your Lordship thence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>And supper too, although thou know’st it not.–</p>

<p>Come, will you go?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span>  I’ll wait upon your Lordship.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
