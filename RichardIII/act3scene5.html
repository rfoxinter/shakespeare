<p><center><i>[Enter Richard and Buckingham, in rotten armor,</p>

<p>marvelous ill-favored.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change thy</p>

<p>color,</p>

<p>Murder thy breath in middle of a word,</p>

<p>And then again begin, and stop again,</p>

<p>As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian,</p>

<p>Speak, and look back, and pry on every side,</p>

<p>Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,</p>

<p>Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks</p>

<p>Are at my service, like enforced smiles,</p>

<p>And both are ready, in their offices,</p>

<p>At any time to grace my stratagems.</p>

<p>But what, is Catesby gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>He is; and see he brings the Mayor along.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Mayor and Catesby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  Lord Mayor–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Look to the drawbridge there!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  Hark, a drum!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Catesby, o’erlook the walls.</p>

<p><center><i>[Catesby exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Look back! Defend thee! Here are enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>God and our innocence defend and guard us!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lovell and Ratcliffe, with Hastings’ head.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Be patient. They are friends, Ratcliffe and Lovell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span></p>

<p>Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,</p>

<p>The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>So dear I loved the man that I must weep.</p>

<p>I took him for the plainest harmless creature</p>

<p>That breathed upon the Earth a Christian;</p>

<p>Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded</p>

<p>The history of all her secret thoughts.</p>

<p>So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue</p>

<p>That, his apparent open guilt omitted–</p>

<p>I mean his conversation with Shore’s wife–</p>

<p>He lived from all attainder of suspects.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>Well, well, he was the covert’st sheltered traitor</p>

<p>That ever lived.–</p>

<p>Would you imagine, or almost believe,</p>

<p>Were ’t not that by great preservation</p>

<p>We live to tell it, that the subtle traitor</p>

<p>This day had plotted, in the council house,</p>

<p>To murder me and my good lord of Gloucester?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mayor</span>  Had he done so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>What, think you we are Turks or infidels?</p>

<p>Or that we would, against the form of law,</p>

<p>Proceed thus rashly in the villain’s death,</p>

<p>But that the extreme peril of the case,</p>

<p>The peace of England, and our persons’ safety</p>

<p>Enforced us to this execution?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mayor</span></p>

<p>Now fair befall you! He deserved his death,</p>

<p>And your good Graces both have well proceeded</p>

<p>To warn false traitors from the like attempts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>I never looked for better at his hands</p>

<p>After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.</p>

<p>Yet had we not determined he should die</p>

<p>Until your Lordship came to see his end</p>

<p>(Which now the loving haste of these our friends,</p>

<p>Something against our meanings, have prevented),</p>

<p>Because, my lord, I would have had you heard</p>

<p>The traitor speak and timorously confess</p>

<p>The manner and the purpose of his treasons,</p>

<p>That you might well have signified the same</p>

<p>Unto the citizens, who haply may</p>

<p>Misconster us in him, and wail his death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mayor</span></p>

<p>But, my good lord, your Graces’ words shall serve</p>

<p>As well as I had seen and heard him speak;</p>

<p>And do not doubt, right noble princes both,</p>

<p>But I’ll acquaint our duteous citizens</p>

<p>With all your just proceedings in this case.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>And to that end we wished your Lordship here,</p>

<p>T’ avoid the censures of the carping world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>Which since you come too late of our intent,</p>

<p>Yet witness what you hear we did intend.</p>

<p>And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[Mayor exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Go after, after, cousin Buckingham.</p>

<p>The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post.</p>

<p>There, at your meetest vantage of the time,</p>

<p>Infer the bastardy of Edward’s children.</p>

<p>Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen</p>

<p>Only for saying he would make his son</p>

<p>Heir to the Crown–meaning indeed his house,</p>

<p>Which, by the sign thereof, was termed so.</p>

<p>Moreover, urge his hateful luxury</p>

<p>And bestial appetite in change of lust,</p>

<p>Which stretched unto their servants, daughters,</p>

<p>wives,</p>

<p>Even where his raging eye or savage heart,</p>

<p>Without control, lusted to make a prey.</p>

<p>Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:</p>

<p>Tell them when that my mother went with child</p>

<p>Of that insatiate Edward, noble York</p>

<p>My princely father then had wars in France,</p>

<p>And, by true computation of the time,</p>

<p>Found that the issue was not his begot,</p>

<p>Which well appeared in his lineaments,</p>

<p>Being nothing like the noble duke my father.</p>

<p>Yet touch this sparingly, as ’twere far off,</p>

<p>Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>Doubt not, my lord. I’ll play the orator</p>

<p>As if the golden fee for which I plead</p>

<p>Were for myself. And so, my lord, adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard’s Castle,</p>

<p>Where you shall find me well accompanied</p>

<p>With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>I go; and towards three or four o’clock</p>

<p>Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.</p>

<p><center><i>[Buckingham exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Go, Lovell, with all speed to Doctor Shaa.</p>

<p><i>[To Ratcliffe.]</i> Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them</p>

<p>both</p>

<p>Meet me within this hour at Baynard’s Castle.</p>

<p><center><i>[Ratcliffe and Lovell exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now will I go to take some privy order</p>

<p>To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,</p>

<p>And to give order that no manner person</p>

<p>Have any time recourse unto the Princes.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
