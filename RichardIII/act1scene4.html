<p><center><i>[Enter Clarence and Keeper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span></p>

<p>Why looks your Grace so heavily today?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>O, I have passed a miserable night,</p>

<p>So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,</p>

<p>That, as I am a Christian faithful man,</p>

<p>I would not spend another such a night</p>

<p>Though ’twere to buy a world of happy days,</p>

<p>So full of dismal terror was the time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span></p>

<p>What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower</p>

<p>And was embarked to cross to Burgundy,</p>

<p>And in my company my brother Gloucester,</p>

<p>Who from my cabin tempted me to walk</p>

<p>Upon the hatches. Thence we looked toward</p>

<p>England</p>

<p>And cited up a thousand heavy times,</p>

<p>During the wars of York and Lancaster,</p>

<p>That had befall’n us. As we paced along</p>

<p>Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,</p>

<p>Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling</p>

<p>Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard</p>

<p>Into the tumbling billows of the main.</p>

<p>O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,</p>

<p>What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,</p>

<p>What sights of ugly death within my eyes.</p>

<p>Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks,</p>

<p>A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon,</p>

<p>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,</p>

<p>Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,</p>

<p>All scattered in the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>Some lay in dead men’s skulls, and in the holes</p>

<p>Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept–</p>

<p>As ’twere in scorn of eyes–reflecting gems,</p>

<p>That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep</p>

<p>And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span></p>

<p>Had you such leisure in the time of death</p>

<p>To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Methought I had, and often did I strive</p>

<p>To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood</p>

<p>Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth</p>

<p>To find the empty, vast, and wand’ring air,</p>

<p>But smothered it within my panting bulk,</p>

<p>Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span></p>

<p>Awaked you not in this sore agony?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>No, no, my dream was lengthened after life.</p>

<p>O, then began the tempest to my soul.</p>

<p>I passed, methought, the melancholy flood,</p>

<p>With that sour ferryman which poets write of,</p>

<p>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.</p>

<p>The first that there did greet my stranger-soul</p>

<p>Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,</p>

<p>Who spake aloud “What scourge for perjury</p>

<p>Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?”</p>

<p>And so he vanished. Then came wand’ring by</p>

<p>A shadow like an angel, with bright hair</p>

<p>Dabbled in blood, and he shrieked out aloud</p>

<p>“Clarence is come–false, fleeting, perjured</p>

<p>Clarence,</p>

<p>That stabbed me in the field by Tewkesbury.</p>

<p>Seize on him, furies. Take him unto torment.”</p>

<p>With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends</p>

<p>Environed me and howled in mine ears</p>

<p>Such hideous cries that with the very noise</p>

<p>I trembling waked, and for a season after</p>

<p>Could not believe but that I was in hell,</p>

<p>Such terrible impression made my dream.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span></p>

<p>No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you.</p>

<p>I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Ah keeper, keeper, I have done these things,</p>

<p>That now give evidence against my soul,</p>

<p>For Edward’s sake, and see how he requites me.–</p>

<p>O God, if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,</p>

<p>But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,</p>

<p>Yet execute thy wrath in me alone!</p>

<p>O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!–</p>

<p>Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile.</p>

<p>My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span></p>

<p>I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.</p>

<p><center><i>[Clarence sleeps.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Brakenbury the Lieutenant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brakenbury</span></p>

<p>Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,</p>

<p>Makes the night morning, and the noontide night.</p>

<p>Princes have but their titles for their glories,</p>

<p>An outward honor for an inward toil,</p>

<p>And, for unfelt imaginations,</p>

<p>They often feel a world of restless cares,</p>

<p>So that between their titles and low name</p>

<p>There’s nothing differs but the outward fame.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter two Murderers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Ho, who’s here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brakenbury</span></p>

<p>What wouldst thou, fellow? And how cam’st thou</p>

<p>hither?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  I would speak with Clarence, and I</p>

<p>came hither on my legs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brakenbury</span>  What, so brief?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  ’Tis better, sir, than to be tedious.–</p>

<p>Let him see our commission, and talk no more.</p>

<p><center><i>[Brakenbury reads the commission.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brakenbury</span></p>

<p>I am in this commanded to deliver</p>

<p>The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.</p>

<p>I will not reason what is meant hereby</p>

<p>Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.</p>

<p>There lies the Duke asleep, and there the keys.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands them keys.]</i></center></p>

<p>I’ll to the King and signify to him</p>

<p>That thus I have resigned to you my charge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  You may, sir. ’Tis a point of wisdom.</p>

<p>Fare you well.</p>

<p><center><i>[Brakenbury and the Keeper exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  What, shall I stab him as he</p>

<p>sleeps?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  No. He’ll say ’twas done cowardly,</p>

<p>when he wakes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Why, he shall never wake until the</p>

<p>great Judgment Day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Why, then he’ll say we stabbed him</p>

<p>sleeping.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  The urging of that word “judgment”</p>

<p>hath bred a kind of remorse in me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  What, art thou afraid?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Not to kill him, having a warrant,</p>

<p>but to be damned for killing him, from the which</p>

<p>no warrant can defend me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  I thought thou hadst been resolute.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  So I am–to let him live.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  I’ll back to the Duke of Gloucester</p>

<p>and tell him so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Nay, I prithee stay a little. I hope</p>

<p>this passionate humor of mine will change. It was</p>

<p>wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  How dost thou feel thyself now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Faith, some certain dregs of conscience</p>

<p>are yet within me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Remember our reward when the</p>

<p>deed’s done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Zounds, he dies! I had forgot the</p>

<p>reward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Where’s thy conscience now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  O, in the Duke of Gloucester’s</p>

<p>purse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  When he opens his purse to give us</p>

<p>our reward, thy conscience flies out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  ’Tis no matter. Let it go. There’s</p>

<p>few or none will entertain it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  What if it come to thee again?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  I’ll not meddle with it. It makes a</p>

<p>man a coward: a man cannot steal but it accuseth</p>

<p>him; a man cannot swear but it checks him; a man</p>

<p>cannot lie with his neighbor’s wife but it detects</p>

<p>him. ’Tis a blushing, shamefaced spirit that mutinies</p>

<p>in a man’s bosom. It fills a man full of</p>

<p>obstacles. It made me once restore a purse of gold</p>

<p>that by chance I found. It beggars any man that</p>

<p>keeps it. It is turned out of towns and cities for a</p>

<p>dangerous thing, and every man that means to live</p>

<p>well endeavors to trust to himself and live without it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Zounds, ’tis even now at my elbow,</p>

<p>persuading me not to kill the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Take the devil in thy mind, and</p>

<p>believe him not. He would insinuate with thee but</p>

<p>to make thee sigh.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  I am strong-framed. He cannot prevail</p>

<p>with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Spoke like a tall man that respects</p>

<p>thy reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Take him on the costard with the</p>

<p>hilts of thy sword, and then throw him into the</p>

<p>malmsey butt in the next room.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  O, excellent device–and make a</p>

<p>sop of him!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Soft, he wakes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Strike!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  No, we’ll reason with him.</p>

<p><center><i>[Clarence wakes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Where art thou, keeper? Give me a cup of wine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>In God’s name, what art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  A man, as you are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span>  But not, as I am, royal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Nor you, as we are, loyal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>My voice is now the King’s, my looks mine own.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!</p>

<p>Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?</p>

<p>Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  To, to, to–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span>  To murder me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span>  Ay, ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so</p>

<p>And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.</p>

<p>Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>Offended us you have not, but the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>I shall be reconciled to him again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>Never, my lord. Therefore prepare to die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Are you drawn forth among a world of men</p>

<p>To slay the innocent? What is my offense?</p>

<p>Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?</p>

<p>What lawful quest have given their verdict up</p>

<p>Unto the frowning judge? Or who pronounced</p>

<p>The bitter sentence of poor Clarence’ death</p>

<p>Before I be convict by course of law?</p>

<p>To threaten me with death is most unlawful.</p>

<p>I charge you, as you hope to have redemption,</p>

<p>By Christ’s dear blood shed for our grievous sins,</p>

<p>That you depart, and lay no hands on me.</p>

<p>The deed you undertake is damnable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>What we will do, we do upon command.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>And he that hath commanded is our king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Erroneous vassals, the great King of kings</p>

<p>Hath in the table of His law commanded</p>

<p>That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then</p>

<p>Spurn at His edict and fulfill a man’s?</p>

<p>Take heed, for He holds vengeance in His hand</p>

<p>To hurl upon their heads that break His law.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee</p>

<p>For false forswearing and for murder too.</p>

<p>Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight</p>

<p>In quarrel of the House of Lancaster.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>And, like a traitor to the name of God,</p>

<p>Didst break that vow, and with thy treacherous</p>

<p>blade</p>

<p>Unrippedst the bowels of thy sovereign’s son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>How canst thou urge God’s dreadful law to us</p>

<p>When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Alas! For whose sake did I that ill deed?</p>

<p>For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.</p>

<p>He sends you not to murder me for this,</p>

<p>For in that sin he is as deep as I.</p>

<p>If God will be avenged for the deed,</p>

<p>O, know you yet He doth it publicly!</p>

<p>Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm;</p>

<p>He needs no indirect or lawless course</p>

<p>To cut off those that have offended Him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>Who made thee then a bloody minister</p>

<p>When gallant-springing, brave Plantagenet,</p>

<p>That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>My brother’s love, the devil, and my rage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>Thy brother’s love, our duty, and thy faults</p>

<p>Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>If you do love my brother, hate not me.</p>

<p>I am his brother, and I love him well.</p>

<p>If you are hired for meed, go back again,</p>

<p>And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,</p>

<p>Who shall reward you better for my life</p>

<p>Than Edward will for tidings of my death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>You are deceived. Your brother Gloucester hates</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>O no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.</p>

<p>Go you to him from me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Ay, so we will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Tell him, when that our princely father York</p>

<p>Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm,</p>

<p>He little thought of this divided friendship.</p>

<p>Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>Ay, millstones, as he lessoned us to weep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>O, do not slander him, for he is kind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you deceive</p>

<p>yourself.</p>

<p>’Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>It cannot be, for he bewept my fortune,</p>

<p>And hugged me in his arms, and swore with sobs</p>

<p>That he would labor my delivery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>Why, so he doth, when he delivers you</p>

<p>From this Earth’s thralldom to the joys of heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Have you that holy feeling in your souls</p>

<p>To counsel me to make my peace with God,</p>

<p>And are you yet to your own souls so blind</p>

<p>That you will war with God by murd’ring me?</p>

<p>O sirs, consider: they that set you on</p>

<p>To do this deed will hate you for the deed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span> <i>[to First Murderer]</i></p>

<p>What shall we do?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span>  Relent, and save your souls.</p>

<p>Which of you–if you were a prince’s son</p>

<p>Being pent from liberty, as I am now–</p>

<p>If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,</p>

<p>Would not entreat for life? Ay, you would beg,</p>

<p>Were you in my distress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>Relent? No. ’Tis cowardly and womanish.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.</p>

<p><i>[To Second Murderer.]</i> My friend, I spy some pity</p>

<p>in thy looks.</p>

<p>O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,</p>

<p>Come thou on my side and entreat for me.</p>

<p>A begging prince what beggar pities not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Look behind you, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>Take that, and that. <i>[(Stabs him.)]</i> If all this will not</p>

<p>do,</p>

<p>I’ll drown you in the malmsey butt within.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with the body.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>A bloody deed, and desperately dispatched.</p>

<p>How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands</p>

<p>Of this most grievous murder.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter First Murderer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>How now? What mean’st thou that thou help’st me</p>

<p>not?</p>

<p>By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you</p>

<p>have been.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>I would he knew that I had saved his brother.</p>

<p>Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say,</p>

<p>For I repent me that the Duke is slain.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.</p>

<p>Well, I’ll go hide the body in some hole</p>

<p>Till that the Duke give order for his burial.</p>

<p>And when I have my meed, I will away,</p>

<p>For this will out, and then I must not stay.</p>
