<p><center><i>[Enter Queen Elizabeth, the Lord Marquess of Dorset,</p>

<p>Lord Rivers, and Lord Grey.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc></p>

<p>Have patience, madam. There’s no doubt his</p>

<p>Majesty</p>

<p>Will soon recover his accustomed health.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grey</sc></p>

<p>In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse.</p>

<p>Therefore, for God’s sake, entertain good comfort</p>

<p>And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>If he were dead, what would betide on me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grey</sc></p>

<p>No other harm but loss of such a lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>The loss of such a lord includes all harms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grey</sc></p>

<p>The heavens have blessed you with a goodly son</p>

<p>To be your comforter when he is gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Ah, he is young, and his minority</p>

<p>Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,</p>

<p>A man that loves not me nor none of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc></p>

<p>Is it concluded he shall be Protector?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>It is determined, not concluded yet;</p>

<p>But so it must be if the King miscarry.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Buckingham and Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grey</sc></p>

<p>Here comes the lord of Buckingham, and Derby.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>Good time of day unto your royal Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>God make your Majesty joyful, as you have been.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>The Countess Richmond, good my lord of Derby,</p>

<p>To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.</p>

<p>Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she’s your wife</p>

<p>And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured</p>

<p>I hate not you for her proud arrogance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>I do beseech you either not believe</p>

<p>The envious slanders of her false accusers,</p>

<p>Or if she be accused on true report,</p>

<p>Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds</p>

<p>From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Saw you the King today, my lord of Derby?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>But now the Duke of Buckingham and I</p>

<p>Are come from visiting his Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>What likelihood of his amendment, lords?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Madam, good hope. His Grace speaks cheerfully.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>God grant him health. Did you confer with him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Ay, madam. He desires to make atonement</p>

<p>Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,</p>

<p>And between them and my Lord Chamberlain,</p>

<p>And sent to warn them to his royal presence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Would all were well–but that will never be.</p>

<p>I fear our happiness is at the height.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and Hastings.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>They do me wrong, and I will not endure it!</p>

<p>Who is it that complains unto the King</p>

<p>That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?</p>

<p>By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly</p>

<p>That fill his ears with such dissentious rumors.</p>

<p>Because I cannot flatter and look fair,</p>

<p>Smile in men’s faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,</p>

<p>Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,</p>

<p>I must be held a rancorous enemy.</p>

<p>Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,</p>

<p>But thus his simple truth must be abused</p>

<p>With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grey</sc></p>

<p>To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.</p>

<p>When have I injured thee? When done thee</p>

<p>wrong?–</p>

<p>Or thee?–Or thee? Or any of your faction?</p>

<p>A plague upon you all! His royal Grace,</p>

<p>Whom God preserve better than you would wish,</p>

<p>Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while</p>

<p>But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.</p>

<p>The King, on his own royal disposition,</p>

<p>And not provoked by any suitor else,</p>

<p>Aiming belike at your interior hatred</p>

<p>That in your outward action shows itself</p>

<p>Against my children, brothers, and myself,</p>

<p>Makes him to send, that he may learn the ground.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I cannot tell. The world is grown so bad</p>

<p>That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.</p>

<p>Since every Jack became a gentleman,</p>

<p>There’s many a gentle person made a Jack.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Come, come, we know your meaning, brother</p>

<p>Gloucester.</p>

<p>You envy my advancement, and my friends’.</p>

<p>God grant we never may have need of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Meantime God grants that we have need of</p>

<p>you.</p>

<p>Our brother is imprisoned by your means,</p>

<p>Myself disgraced, and the nobility</p>

<p>Held in contempt, while great promotions</p>

<p>Are daily given to ennoble those</p>

<p>That scarce some two days since were worth a</p>

<p>noble.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>By Him that raised me to this careful height</p>

<p>From that contented hap which I enjoyed,</p>

<p>I never did incense his Majesty</p>

<p>Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been</p>

<p>An earnest advocate to plead for him.</p>

<p>My lord, you do me shameful injury</p>

<p>Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>You may deny that you were not the mean</p>

<p>Of my Lord Hastings’ late imprisonment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc>  She may, my lord, for–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>She may, Lord Rivers. Why, who knows not so?</p>

<p>She may do more, sir, than denying that.</p>

<p>She may help you to many fair preferments</p>

<p>And then deny her aiding hand therein,</p>

<p>And lay those honors on your high desert.</p>

<p>What may she not? She may, ay, marry, may she–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc>  What, marry, may she?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,</p>

<p>A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.</p>

<p>Iwis, your grandam had a worser match.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>My lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne</p>

<p>Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.</p>

<p>By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty</p>

<p>Of those gross taunts that oft I have endured.</p>

<p>I had rather be a country servant-maid</p>

<p>Than a great queen with this condition,</p>

<p>To be so baited, scorned, and stormed at.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter old Queen Margaret, apart from the others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Small joy have I in being England’s queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>And lessened be that small, God I beseech Him!</p>

<p>Thy honor, state, and seat is due to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>What, threat you me with telling of the King?</p>

<p>Tell him and spare not. Look, what I have said,</p>

<p>I will avouch ’t in presence of the King;</p>

<p>I dare adventure to be sent to th’ Tower.</p>

<p>’Tis time to speak. My pains are quite forgot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Out, devil! I do remember them too well:</p>

<p>Thou killed’st my husband Henry in the Tower,</p>

<p>And Edward, my poor son, at Tewkesbury.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband king,</p>

<p>I was a packhorse in his great affairs,</p>

<p>A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,</p>

<p>A liberal rewarder of his friends.</p>

<p>To royalize his blood, I spent mine own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Ay, and much better blood than his or thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>In all which time, you and your husband Grey</p>

<p>Were factious for the House of Lancaster.–</p>

<p>And, Rivers, so were you.–Was not your husband</p>

<p>In Margaret’s battle at Saint Albans slain?</p>

<p>Let me put in your minds, if you forget,</p>

<p>What you have been ere this, and what you are;</p>

<p>Withal, what I have been, and what I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>A murd’rous villain, and so still thou art.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick,</p>

<p>Ay, and forswore himself–which Jesu pardon!–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Which God revenge!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>To fight on Edward’s party for the crown;</p>

<p>And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.</p>

<p>I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward’s,</p>

<p>Or Edward’s soft and pitiful, like mine.</p>

<p>I am too childish-foolish for this world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave this world,</p>

<p>Thou cacodemon! There thy kingdom is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc></p>

<p>My lord of Gloucester, in those busy days</p>

<p>Which here you urge to prove us enemies,</p>

<p>We followed then our lord, our sovereign king.</p>

<p>So should we you, if you should be our king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>If I should be? I had rather be a peddler.</p>

<p>Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>As little joy, my lord, as you suppose</p>

<p>You should enjoy were you this country’s king,</p>

<p>As little joy you may suppose in me</p>

<p>That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>As little joy enjoys the queen thereof,</p>

<p>For I am she, and altogether joyless.</p>

<p>I can no longer hold me patient.</p>

<p><center><i>[She steps forward.]</i></center></p>

<p>Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out</p>

<p>In sharing that which you have pilled from me!</p>

<p>Which of you trembles not that looks on me?</p>

<p>If not, that I am queen, you bow like subjects,</p>

<p>Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels.–</p>

<p>Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Foul, wrinkled witch, what mak’st thou in my</p>

<p>sight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>But repetition of what thou hast marred.</p>

<p>That will I make before I let thee go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Wert thou not banished on pain of death?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>I was, but I do find more pain in banishment</p>

<p>Than death can yield me here by my abode.</p>

<p>A husband and a son thou ow’st to me;</p>

<p><i>[To Queen Elizabeth.]</i> And thou a kingdom;–all</p>

<p>of you, allegiance.</p>

<p>This sorrow that I have by right is yours,</p>

<p>And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>The curse my noble father laid on thee</p>

<p>When thou didst crown his warlike brows with</p>

<p>paper,</p>

<p>And with thy scorns drew’st rivers from his eyes,</p>

<p>And then, to dry them, gav’st the Duke a clout</p>

<p>Steeped in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland–</p>

<p>His curses then, from bitterness of soul</p>

<p>Denounced against thee, are all fall’n upon thee,</p>

<p>And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>So just is God to right the innocent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>O, ’twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,</p>

<p>And the most merciless that e’er was heard of!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc></p>

<p>Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorset</sc></p>

<p>No man but prophesied revenge for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>What, were you snarling all before I came,</p>

<p>Ready to catch each other by the throat,</p>

<p>And turn you all your hatred now on me?</p>

<p>Did York’s dread curse prevail so much with</p>

<p>heaven</p>

<p>That Henry’s death, my lovely Edward’s death,</p>

<p>Their kingdom’s loss, my woeful banishment,</p>

<p>Should all but answer for that peevish brat?</p>

<p>Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?</p>

<p>Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick</p>

<p>curses!</p>

<p>Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,</p>

<p>As ours by murder to make him a king.</p>

<p><i>[To Queen Elizabeth.]</i> Edward thy son, that now is</p>

<p>Prince of Wales,</p>

<p>For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,</p>

<p>Die in his youth by like untimely violence.</p>

<p>Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,</p>

<p>Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self.</p>

<p>Long mayst thou live to wail thy children’s death</p>

<p>And see another, as I see thee now,</p>

<p>Decked in thy rights, as thou art stalled in mine.</p>

<p>Long die thy happy days before thy death,</p>

<p>And, after many lengthened hours of grief,</p>

<p>Die neither mother, wife, nor England’s queen.–</p>

<p>Rivers and Dorset, you were standers-by,</p>

<p>And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son</p>

<p>Was stabbed with bloody daggers. God I pray Him</p>

<p>That none of you may live his natural age,</p>

<p>But by some unlooked accident cut off.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Have done thy charm, thou hateful, withered hag.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou shalt hear</p>

<p>me.</p>

<p>If heaven have any grievous plague in store</p>

<p>Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,</p>

<p>O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe</p>

<p>And then hurl down their indignation</p>

<p>On thee, the troubler of the poor world’s peace.</p>

<p>The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul.</p>

<p>Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv’st,</p>

<p>And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends.</p>

<p>No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,</p>

<p>Unless it be while some tormenting dream</p>

<p>Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils.</p>

<p>Thou elvish-marked, abortive, rooting hog,</p>

<p>Thou that wast sealed in thy nativity</p>

<p>The slave of nature and the son of hell,</p>

<p>Thou slander of thy heavy mother’s womb,</p>

<p>Thou loathed issue of thy father’s loins,</p>

<p>Thou rag of honor, thou detested–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Margaret.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc>  Richard!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  Ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc>  I call thee not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I cry thee mercy, then, for I did think</p>

<p>That thou hadst called me all these bitter names.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Why, so I did, but looked for no reply.</p>

<p>O, let me make the period to my curse!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>’Tis done by me and ends in “Margaret.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc> <i>[to Queen Margaret]</i></p>

<p>Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune,</p>

<p>Why strew’st thou sugar on that bottled spider,</p>

<p>Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?</p>

<p>Fool, fool, thou whet’st a knife to kill thyself.</p>

<p>The day will come that thou shalt wish for me</p>

<p>To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-backed</p>

<p>toad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,</p>

<p>Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Foul shame upon you, you have all moved mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc></p>

<p>Were you well served, you would be taught your</p>

<p>duty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>To serve me well, you all should do me duty:</p>

<p>Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects.</p>

<p>O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorset</sc> <i>[to Rivers]</i></p>

<p>Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Peace, Master Marquess, you are malapert.</p>

<p>Your fire-new stamp of honor is scarce current.</p>

<p>O, that your young nobility could judge</p>

<p>What ’twere to lose it and be miserable!</p>

<p>They that stand high have many blasts to shake</p>

<p>them,</p>

<p>And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Good counsel, marry.–Learn it, learn it, marquess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorset</sc></p>

<p>It touches you, my lord, as much as me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ay, and much more; but I was born so high.</p>

<p>Our aerie buildeth in the cedar’s top,</p>

<p>And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>And turns the sun to shade. Alas, alas,</p>

<p>Witness my son, now in the shade of death,</p>

<p>Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath</p>

<p>Hath in eternal darkness folded up.</p>

<p>Your aerie buildeth in our aerie’s nest.</p>

<p>O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!</p>

<p>As it is won with blood, lost be it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Urge neither charity nor shame to me.</p>

<p><i>[Addressing the others.]</i> Uncharitably with me have</p>

<p>you dealt,</p>

<p>And shamefully my hopes by you are butchered.</p>

<p>My charity is outrage, life my shame,</p>

<p>And in that shame still live my sorrows’ rage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  Have done, have done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>O princely Buckingham, I’ll kiss thy hand</p>

<p>In sign of league and amity with thee.</p>

<p>Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!</p>

<p>Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,</p>

<p>Nor thou within the compass of my curse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Nor no one here, for curses never pass</p>

<p>The lips of those that breathe them in the air.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>I will not think but they ascend the sky,</p>

<p>And there awake God’s gentle sleeping peace.</p>

<p><i>[Aside to Buckingham.]</i> O Buckingham, take heed of</p>

<p>yonder dog!</p>

<p>Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,</p>

<p>His venom tooth will rankle to the death.</p>

<p>Have not to do with him. Beware of him.</p>

<p>Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,</p>

<p>And all their ministers attend on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>What doth she say, my lord of Buckingham?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel,</p>

<p>And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?</p>

<p>O, but remember this another day,</p>

<p>When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,</p>

<p>And say poor Margaret was a prophetess.–</p>

<p>Live each of you the subjects to his hate,</p>

<p>And he to yours, and all of you to God’s.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc></p>

<p>And so doth mine. I muse why she’s at liberty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I cannot blame her. By God’s holy mother,</p>

<p>She hath had too much wrong, and I repent</p>

<p>My part thereof that I have done to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>I never did her any, to my knowledge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.</p>

<p>I was too hot to do somebody good</p>

<p>That is too cold in thinking of it now.</p>

<p>Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid;</p>

<p>He is franked up to fatting for his pains.</p>

<p>God pardon them that are the cause thereof.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc></p>

<p>A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion</p>

<p>To pray for them that have done scathe to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>So do I ever–<i>[(speaks to himself)]</i> being well advised,</p>

<p>For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Catesby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>Madam, his Majesty doth call for you,–</p>

<p>And for your Grace,–and yours, my gracious</p>

<p>lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Catesby, I come.–Lords, will you go with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc>  We wait upon your Grace.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Richard, Duke of Gloucester exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I do the wrong and first begin to brawl.</p>

<p>The secret mischiefs that I set abroach</p>

<p>I lay unto the grievous charge of others.</p>

<p>Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness,</p>

<p>I do beweep to many simple gulls,</p>

<p>Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham,</p>

<p>And tell them ’tis the Queen and her allies</p>

<p>That stir the King against the Duke my brother.</p>

<p>Now they believe it and withal whet me</p>

<p>To be revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey;</p>

<p>But then I sigh and, with a piece of scripture,</p>

<p>Tell them that God bids us do good for evil;</p>

<p>And thus I clothe my naked villainy</p>

<p>With odd old ends stol’n forth of Holy Writ,</p>

<p>And seem a saint when most I play the devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter two Murderers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But soft, here come my executioners.–</p>

<p>How now, my hardy, stout, resolved mates?</p>

<p>Are you now going to dispatch this thing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderer</sc></p>

<p>We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant</p>

<p>That we may be admitted where he is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Well thought upon. I have it here about me.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.</p>

<p>But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,</p>

<p>Withal obdurate; do not hear him plead,</p>

<p>For Clarence is well-spoken and perhaps</p>

<p>May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderer</sc></p>

<p>Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate.</p>

<p>Talkers are no good doers. Be assured</p>

<p>We go to use our hands and not our tongues.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Your eyes drop millstones when fools’ eyes fall</p>

<p>tears.</p>

<p>I like you lads. About your business straight.</p>

<p>Go, go, dispatch.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderers</sc>  We will, my noble lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
