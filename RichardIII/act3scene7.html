<p><center><i>[Enter Richard and Buckingham at several doors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>How now, how now? What say the citizens?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,</p>

<p>The citizens are mum, say not a word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Touched you the bastardy of Edward’s children?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy</p>

<p>And his contract by deputy in France;</p>

<p>Th’ unsatiate greediness of his desire</p>

<p>And his enforcement of the city wives;</p>

<p>His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,</p>

<p>As being got, your father then in France,</p>

<p>And his resemblance being not like the Duke.</p>

<p>Withal, I did infer your lineaments,</p>

<p>Being the right idea of your father,</p>

<p>Both in your form and nobleness of mind;</p>

<p>Laid open all your victories in Scotland,</p>

<p>Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,</p>

<p>Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;</p>

<p>Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose</p>

<p>Untouched or slightly handled in discourse.</p>

<p>And when mine oratory drew toward end,</p>

<p>I bid them that did love their country’s good</p>

<p>Cry “God save Richard, England’s royal king!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  And did they so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>No. So God help me, they spake not a word</p>

<p>But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,</p>

<p>Stared each on other and looked deadly pale;</p>

<p>Which when I saw, I reprehended them</p>

<p>And asked the Mayor what meant this willful silence.</p>

<p>His answer was, the people were not used</p>

<p>To be spoke to but by the Recorder.</p>

<p>Then he was urged to tell my tale again:</p>

<p>“Thus saith the Duke. Thus hath the Duke</p>

<p>inferred”–</p>

<p>But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.</p>

<p>When he had done, some followers of mine own,</p>

<p>At lower end of the hall, hurled up their caps,</p>

<p>And some ten voices cried “God save King Richard!”</p>

<p>And thus I took the vantage of those few.</p>

<p>“Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,” quoth I.</p>

<p>“This general applause and cheerful shout</p>

<p>Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard”–</p>

<p>And even here brake off and came away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>What tongueless blocks were they! Would they not</p>

<p>speak?</p>

<p>Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;</p>

<p>Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit.</p>

<p>And look you get a prayer book in your hand</p>

<p>And stand between two churchmen, good my lord,</p>

<p>For on that ground I’ll make a holy descant.</p>

<p>And be not easily won to our requests.</p>

<p>Play the maid’s part: still answer “nay,” and take it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I go. An if you plead as well for them</p>

<p>As I can say “nay” to thee for myself,</p>

<p>No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.</p>

<p><center><i>[Knocking within.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Go, go, up to the leads. The Lord Mayor knocks.</p>

<p><center><i>[Richard exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Mayor and Citizens.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance here.</p>

<p>I think the Duke will not be spoke withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Catesby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,</p>

<p>To visit him tomorrow or next day.</p>

<p>He is within, with two right reverend fathers,</p>

<p>Divinely bent to meditation,</p>

<p>And in no worldly suits would he be moved</p>

<p>To draw him from his holy exercise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Return, good Catesby, to the gracious duke.</p>

<p>Tell him myself, the Mayor, and aldermen,</p>

<p>In deep designs, in matter of great moment</p>

<p>No less importing than our general good,</p>

<p>Are come to have some conference with his Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>I’ll signify so much unto him straight.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!</p>

<p>He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,</p>

<p>But on his knees at meditation;</p>

<p>Not dallying with a brace of courtesans,</p>

<p>But meditating with two deep divines;</p>

<p>Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,</p>

<p>But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.</p>

<p>Happy were England would this virtuous prince</p>

<p>Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof.</p>

<p>But sure I fear we shall not win him to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mayor</sc></p>

<p>Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Catesby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now, Catesby, what says his Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>He wonders to what end you have assembled</p>

<p>Such troops of citizens to come to him,</p>

<p>His Grace not being warned thereof before.</p>

<p>He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Sorry I am my noble cousin should</p>

<p>Suspect me that I mean no good to him.</p>

<p>By heaven, we come to him in perfect love,</p>

<p>And so once more return and tell his Grace.</p>

<p><center><i>[Catesby exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>When holy and devout religious men</p>

<p>Are at their beads, ’tis much to draw them thence,</p>

<p>So sweet is zealous contemplation.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Richard aloft, between two Bishops.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Catesby reenters.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mayor</sc></p>

<p>See where his Grace stands, ’tween two clergymen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,</p>

<p>To stay him from the fall of vanity;</p>

<p>And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,</p>

<p>True ornaments to know a holy man.–</p>

<p>Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,</p>

<p>Lend favorable ear to our requests,</p>

<p>And pardon us the interruption</p>

<p>Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>My lord, there needs no such apology.</p>

<p>I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,</p>

<p>Who, earnest in the service of my God,</p>

<p>Deferred the visitation of my friends.</p>

<p>But, leaving this, what is your Grace’s pleasure?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above</p>

<p>And all good men of this ungoverned isle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I do suspect I have done some offense</p>

<p>That seems disgracious in the city’s eye,</p>

<p>And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>You have, my lord. Would it might please your</p>

<p>Grace,</p>

<p>On our entreaties, to amend your fault.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Know, then, it is your fault that you resign</p>

<p>The supreme seat, the throne majestical,</p>

<p>The sceptered office of your ancestors,</p>

<p>Your state of fortune, and your due of birth,</p>

<p>The lineal glory of your royal house,</p>

<p>To the corruption of a blemished stock,</p>

<p>Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,</p>

<p>Which here we waken to our country’s good,</p>

<p>The noble isle doth want her proper limbs–</p>

<p>Her face defaced with scars of infamy,</p>

<p>Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,</p>

<p>And almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf</p>

<p>Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion;</p>

<p>Which to recure, we heartily solicit</p>

<p>Your gracious self to take on you the charge</p>

<p>And kingly government of this your land,</p>

<p>Not as Protector, steward, substitute,</p>

<p>Or lowly factor for another’s gain,</p>

<p>But as successively, from blood to blood,</p>

<p>Your right of birth, your empery, your own.</p>

<p>For this, consorted with the citizens,</p>

<p>Your very worshipful and loving friends,</p>

<p>And by their vehement instigation,</p>

<p>In this just cause come I to move your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I cannot tell if to depart in silence</p>

<p>Or bitterly to speak in your reproof</p>

<p>Best fitteth my degree or your condition.</p>

<p>If not to answer, you might haply think</p>

<p>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</p>

<p>To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</p>

<p>Which fondly you would here impose on me.</p>

<p>If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</p>

<p>So seasoned with your faithful love to me,</p>

<p>Then on the other side I checked my friends.</p>

<p>Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,</p>

<p>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,</p>

<p>Definitively thus I answer you:</p>

<p>Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert</p>

<p>Unmeritable shuns your high request.</p>

<p>First, if all obstacles were cut away</p>

<p>And that my path were even to the crown</p>

<p>As the ripe revenue and due of birth,</p>

<p>Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</p>

<p>So mighty and so many my defects,</p>

<p>That I would rather hide me from my greatness,</p>

<p>Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,</p>

<p>Than in my greatness covet to be hid</p>

<p>And in the vapor of my glory smothered.</p>

<p>But, God be thanked, there is no need of me,</p>

<p>And much I need to help you, were there need.</p>

<p>The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</p>

<p>Which, mellowed by the stealing hours of time,</p>

<p>Will well become the seat of majesty,</p>

<p>And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.</p>

<p>On him I lay that you would lay on me,</p>

<p>The right and fortune of his happy stars,</p>

<p>Which God defend that I should wring from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace,</p>

<p>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</p>

<p>All circumstances well considered.</p>

<p>You say that Edward is your brother’s son;</p>

<p>So say we too, but not by Edward’s wife.</p>

<p>For first was he contract to Lady Lucy–</p>

<p>Your mother lives a witness to his vow–</p>

<p>And afterward by substitute betrothed</p>

<p>To Bona, sister to the King of France.</p>

<p>These both put off, a poor petitioner,</p>

<p>A care-crazed mother to a many sons,</p>

<p>A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</p>

<p>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</p>

<p>Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,</p>

<p>Seduced the pitch and height of his degree</p>

<p>To base declension and loathed bigamy.</p>

<p>By her in his unlawful bed he got</p>

<p>This Edward, whom our manners call “the Prince.”</p>

<p>More bitterly could I expostulate,</p>

<p>Save that, for reverence to some alive,</p>

<p>I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</p>

<p>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</p>

<p>This proffered benefit of dignity,</p>

<p>If not to bless us and the land withal,</p>

<p>Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</p>

<p>From the corruption of abusing times</p>

<p>Unto a lineal, true-derived course.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mayor</sc></p>

<p>Do, good my lord. Your citizens entreat you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffered love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>O, make them joyful. Grant their lawful suit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Alas, why would you heap this care on me?</p>

<p>I am unfit for state and majesty.</p>

<p>I do beseech you, take it not amiss;</p>

<p>I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>If you refuse it, as in love and zeal</p>

<p>Loath to depose the child, your brother’s son–</p>

<p>As well we know your tenderness of heart</p>

<p>And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,</p>

<p>Which we have noted in you to your kindred</p>

<p>And equally indeed to all estates–</p>

<p>Yet know, whe’er you accept our suit or no,</p>

<p>Your brother’s son shall never reign our king,</p>

<p>But we will plant some other in the throne,</p>

<p>To the disgrace and downfall of your house.</p>

<p>And in this resolution here we leave you.–</p>

<p>Come, citizens. Zounds, I’ll entreat no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham!</p>

<p><center><i>[Buckingham and some others exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Catesby</sc></p>

<p>Call him again, sweet prince. Accept their suit.</p>

<p>If you deny them, all the land will rue it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Will you enforce me to a world of cares?</p>

<p>Call them again. I am not made of stones,</p>

<p>But penetrable to your kind entreaties,</p>

<p>Albeit against my conscience and my soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Buckingham and the rest.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Cousin of Buckingham and sage, grave men,</p>

<p>Since you will buckle Fortune on my back,</p>

<p>To bear her burden, whe’er I will or no,</p>

<p>I must have patience to endure the load;</p>

<p>But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach</p>

<p>Attend the sequel of your imposition,</p>

<p>Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me</p>

<p>From all the impure blots and stains thereof,</p>

<p>For God doth know, and you may partly see,</p>

<p>How far I am from the desire of this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mayor</sc></p>

<p>God bless your Grace! We see it and will say it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>In saying so, you shall but say the truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Then I salute you with this royal title:</p>

<p>Long live Richard, England’s worthy king!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Tomorrow may it please you to be crowned?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Even when you please, for you will have it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Tomorrow, then, we will attend your Grace,</p>

<p>And so most joyfully we take our leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[to the Bishops]</i></p>

<p>Come, let us to our holy work again.–</p>

<p>Farewell, my cousin. Farewell, gentle friends.</p>
