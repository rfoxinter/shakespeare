<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tyrrel</sc></p>

<p>The tyrannous and bloody act is done,</p>

<p>The most arch deed of piteous massacre</p>

<p>That ever yet this land was guilty of.</p>

<p>Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn</p>

<p>To do this piece of ruthless butchery,</p>

<p>Albeit they were fleshed villains, bloody dogs,</p>

<p>Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,</p>

<p>Wept like two children in their deaths’ sad story.</p>

<p>“O thus,” quoth Dighton, “lay the gentle babes.”</p>

<p>“Thus, thus,” quoth Forrest, “girdling one another</p>

<p>Within their alabaster innocent arms.</p>

<p>Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,</p>

<p>And in their summer beauty kissed each other.</p>

<p>A book of prayers on their pillow lay,</p>

<p>Which once,” quoth Forrest, “almost changed my</p>

<p>mind,</p>

<p>But, O, the devil–” There the villain stopped;</p>

<p>When Dighton thus told on: “We smothered</p>

<p>The most replenished sweet work of nature</p>

<p>That from the prime creation e’er she framed.”</p>

<p>Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse;</p>

<p>They could not speak; and so I left them both</p>

<p>To bear this tidings to the bloody king.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Richard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>And here he comes.–All health, my sovereign lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tyrrel</sc></p>

<p>If to have done the thing you gave in charge</p>

<p>Beget your happiness, be happy then,</p>

<p>For it is done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  But did’st thou see them dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tyrrel</sc></p>

<p>I did, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc>  And buried, gentle Tyrrel?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tyrrel</sc></p>

<p>The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them,</p>

<p>But where, to say the truth, I do not know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after-supper,</p>

<p>When thou shalt tell the process of their death.</p>

<p>Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,</p>

<p>And be inheritor of thy desire.</p>

<p>Farewell till then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tyrrel</sc>  I humbly take my leave.</p>

<p><center><i>[Tyrrel exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>The son of Clarence have I pent up close,</p>

<p>His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage,</p>

<p>The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham’s bosom,</p>

<p>And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight.</p>

<p>Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims</p>

<p>At young Elizabeth, my brother’s daughter,</p>

<p>And by that knot looks proudly on the crown,</p>

<p>To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ratcliffe.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc>  My lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Good or bad news, that thou com’st in so bluntly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc></p>

<p>Bad news, my lord. Morton is fled to Richmond,</p>

<p>And Buckingham, backed with the hardy Welshmen,</p>

<p>Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ely with Richmond troubles me more near</p>

<p>Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.</p>

<p>Come, I have learned that fearful commenting</p>

<p>Is leaden servitor to dull delay;</p>

<p>Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary;</p>

<p>Then fiery expedition be my wing,</p>

<p>Jove’s Mercury, and herald for a king.</p>

<p>Go, muster men. My counsel is my shield.</p>

<p>We must be brief when traitors brave the field.</p>
