<p><center><i>[Enter Buckingham, Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby,</p>

<p>Hastings, Bishop of Ely, Norfolk, Ratcliffe, Lovell, with</p>

<p>others, at a table.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met</p>

<p>Is to determine of the coronation.</p>

<p>In God’s name, speak. When is the royal day?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Is all things ready for the royal time?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>It is, and wants but nomination.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ely</sc></p>

<p>Tomorrow, then, I judge a happy day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Who knows the Lord Protector’s mind herein?</p>

<p>Who is most inward with the noble duke?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ely</sc></p>

<p>Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his</p>

<p>mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>We know each other’s faces; for our hearts,</p>

<p>He knows no more of mine than I of yours,</p>

<p>Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.–</p>

<p>Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well.</p>

<p>But for his purpose in the coronation,</p>

<p>I have not sounded him, nor he delivered</p>

<p>His gracious pleasure any way therein.</p>

<p>But you, my honorable lords, may name the time,</p>

<p>And in the Duke’s behalf I’ll give my voice,</p>

<p>Which I presume he’ll take in gentle part.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ely</sc></p>

<p>In happy time here comes the Duke himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.</p>

<p>I have been long a sleeper; but I trust</p>

<p>My absence doth neglect no great design</p>

<p>Which by my presence might have been concluded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,</p>

<p>William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part–</p>

<p>I mean your voice for crowning of the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder.</p>

<p>His Lordship knows me well and loves me well.–</p>

<p>My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn</p>

<p>I saw good strawberries in your garden there;</p>

<p>I do beseech you, send for some of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ely</sc></p>

<p>Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.</p>

<p><center><i>[Exit Bishop of Ely.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.</p>

<p><center><i>[They move aside.]</i></center></p>

<p>Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business</p>

<p>And finds the testy gentleman so hot</p>

<p>That he will lose his head ere give consent</p>

<p>His master’s child, as worshipfully he terms it,</p>

<p>Shall lose the royalty of England’s throne.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Withdraw yourself awhile. I’ll go with you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Richard and Buckingham exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>We have not yet set down this day of triumph.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, in my judgment, is too sudden,</p>

<p>For I myself am not so well provided</p>

<p>As else I would be, were the day prolonged.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Bishop of Ely.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ely</sc></p>

<p>Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester?</p>

<p>I have sent for these strawberries.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this</p>

<p>morning.</p>

<p>There’s some conceit or other likes him well</p>

<p>When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.</p>

<p>I think there’s never a man in Christendom</p>

<p>Can lesser hide his love or hate than he,</p>

<p>For by his face straight shall you know his heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>What of his heart perceive you in his face</p>

<p>By any livelihood he showed today?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>Marry, that with no man here he is offended,</p>

<p>For were he, he had shown it in his looks.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Richard and Buckingham.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I pray you all, tell me what they deserve</p>

<p>That do conspire my death with devilish plots</p>

<p>Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevailed</p>

<p>Upon my body with their hellish charms?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,</p>

<p>Makes me most forward in this princely presence</p>

<p>To doom th’ offenders, whosoe’er they be.</p>

<p>I say, my lord, they have deserved death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.</p>

<p><center><i>[He shows his arm.]</i></center></p>

<p>Look how I am bewitched! Behold mine arm</p>

<p>Is like a blasted sapling withered up;</p>

<p>And this is Edward’s wife, that monstrous witch,</p>

<p>Consorted with that harlot, strumpet Shore,</p>

<p>That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>If they have done this deed, my noble lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>If? Thou protector of this damned strumpet,</p>

<p>Talk’st thou to me of “ifs”? Thou art a traitor.–</p>

<p>Off with his head. Now by Saint Paul I swear</p>

<p>I will not dine until I see the same.–</p>

<p>Lovell and Ratcliffe, look that it be done.–</p>

<p>The rest that love me, rise and follow me.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit. Lovell and Ratcliffe remain,</p>

<p>with the Lord Hastings.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>Woe, woe for England! Not a whit for me,</p>

<p>For I, too fond, might have prevented this.</p>

<p>Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm,</p>

<p>And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.</p>

<p>Three times today my foot-cloth horse did stumble,</p>

<p>And started when he looked upon the Tower,</p>

<p>As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse.</p>

<p>O, now I need the priest that spake to me!</p>

<p>I now repent I told the pursuivant,</p>

<p>As too triumphing, how mine enemies</p>

<p>Today at Pomfret bloodily were butchered,</p>

<p>And I myself secure in grace and favor.</p>

<p>O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse</p>

<p>Is lighted on poor Hastings’ wretched head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ratcliffe</sc></p>

<p>Come, come, dispatch. The Duke would be at</p>

<p>dinner.</p>

<p>Make a short shrift. He longs to see your head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>O momentary grace of mortal men,</p>

<p>Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!</p>

<p>Who builds his hope in air of your good looks</p>

<p>Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,</p>

<p>Ready with every nod to tumble down</p>

<p>Into the fatal bowels of the deep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lovell</sc></p>

<p>Come, come, dispatch. ’Tis bootless to exclaim.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc></p>

<p>O bloody Richard! Miserable England,</p>

<p>I prophesy the fearfull’st time to thee</p>

<p>That ever wretched age hath looked upon.–</p>

<p>Come, lead me to the block. Bear him my head.</p>

<p>They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
