<p><center><i>[Enter one Citizen at one door, and another at the other.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>I promise you I scarcely know myself.</p>

<p>Hear you the news abroad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Yes, that the King is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Ill news, by ’r Lady. Seldom comes the better.</p>

<p>I fear, I fear, ’twill prove a giddy world.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter another Citizen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Neighbors, God speed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Give you good morrow, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Doth the news hold of good King Edward’s death?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Ay, sir, it is too true, God help the while.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>No, no, by God’s good grace, his son shall reign.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Woe to that land that’s governed by a child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>In him there is a hope of government,</p>

<p>Which, in his nonage, council under him,</p>

<p>And, in his full and ripened years, himself,</p>

<p>No doubt shall then, and till then, govern well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>So stood the state when Henry the Sixth</p>

<p>Was crowned in Paris but at nine months old.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot,</p>

<p>For then this land was famously enriched</p>

<p>With politic grave counsel; then the King</p>

<p>Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Why, so hath this, both by his father and mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Better it were they all came by his father,</p>

<p>Or by his father there were none at all,</p>

<p>For emulation who shall now be nearest</p>

<p>Will touch us all too near if God prevent not.</p>

<p>O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester,</p>

<p>And the Queen’s sons and brothers haught and</p>

<p>proud,</p>

<p>And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,</p>

<p>This sickly land might solace as before.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Come, come, we fear the worst. All will be well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>When clouds are seen, wise men put on their</p>

<p>cloaks;</p>

<p>When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;</p>

<p>When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?</p>

<p>Untimely storms makes men expect a dearth.</p>

<p>All may be well; but if God sort it so,</p>

<p>’Tis more than we deserve or I expect.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Truly, the hearts of men are full of fear.</p>

<p>You cannot reason almost with a man</p>

<p>That looks not heavily and full of dread.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Before the days of change, still is it so.</p>

<p>By a divine instinct, men’s minds mistrust</p>

<p>Ensuing danger, as by proof we see</p>

<p>The water swell before a boist’rous storm.</p>

<p>But leave it all to God. Whither away?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Marry, we were sent for to the Justices.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>And so was I. I’ll bear you company.</p>
