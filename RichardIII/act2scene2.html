<p><center><i>[Enter the old Duchess of York with the two</p>

<p>children of Clarence.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc></p>

<p>Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc>  No, boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,</p>

<p>And cry “O Clarence, my unhappy son”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc></p>

<p>Why do you look on us and shake your head,</p>

<p>And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,</p>

<p>If that our noble father were alive?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>My pretty cousins, you mistake me both.</p>

<p>I do lament the sickness of the King,</p>

<p>As loath to lose him, not your father’s death.</p>

<p>It were lost sorrow to wail one that’s lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc></p>

<p>Then, you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.</p>

<p>The King mine uncle is to blame for it.</p>

<p>God will revenge it, whom I will importune</p>

<p>With earnest prayers, all to that effect.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  And so will I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Peace, children, peace. The King doth love you</p>

<p>well.</p>

<p>Incapable and shallow innocents,</p>

<p>You cannot guess who caused your father’s death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc></p>

<p>Grandam, we can, for my good uncle Gloucester</p>

<p>Told me the King, provoked to it by the Queen,</p>

<p>Devised impeachments to imprison him;</p>

<p>And when my uncle told me so, he wept,</p>

<p>And pitied me, and kindly kissed my cheek,</p>

<p>Bade me rely on him as on my father,</p>

<p>And he would love me dearly as a child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,</p>

<p>And with a virtuous visor hide deep vice.</p>

<p>He is my son, ay, and therein my shame,</p>

<p>Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc></p>

<p>Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc>  Ay, boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc></p>

<p>I cannot think it. Hark, what noise is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Queen Elizabeth with her hair about her ears,</p>

<p>Rivers and Dorset after her.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,</p>

<p>To chide my fortune and torment myself?</p>

<p>I’ll join with black despair against my soul</p>

<p>And to myself become an enemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>What means this scene of rude impatience?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>To make an act of tragic violence.</p>

<p>Edward, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.</p>

<p>Why grow the branches when the root is gone?</p>

<p>Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?</p>

<p>If you will live, lament. If die, be brief,</p>

<p>That our swift-winged souls may catch the King’s,</p>

<p>Or, like obedient subjects, follow him</p>

<p>To his new kingdom of ne’er-changing night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow</p>

<p>As I had title in thy noble husband.</p>

<p>I have bewept a worthy husband’s death</p>

<p>And lived with looking on his images;</p>

<p>But now two mirrors of his princely semblance</p>

<p>Are cracked in pieces by malignant death,</p>

<p>And I, for comfort, have but one false glass</p>

<p>That grieves me when I see my shame in him.</p>

<p>Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother,</p>

<p>And hast the comfort of thy children left,</p>

<p>But death hath snatched my husband from mine</p>

<p>arms</p>

<p>And plucked two crutches from my feeble hands,</p>

<p>Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I,</p>

<p>Thine being but a moiety of my moan,</p>

<p>To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father’s death.</p>

<p>How can we aid you with our kindred tears?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>Our fatherless distress was left unmoaned.</p>

<p>Your widow-dolor likewise be unwept!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Give me no help in lamentation.</p>

<p>I am not barren to bring forth complaints.</p>

<p>All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,</p>

<p>That I, being governed by the watery moon,</p>

<p>May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world.</p>

<p>Ah, for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Children</sc></p>

<p>Ah, for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>What stay had I but Edward? And he’s gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Children</sc></p>

<p>What stay had we but Clarence? And he’s gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>What stays had I but they? And they are gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Elizabeth</sc></p>

<p>Was never widow had so dear a loss.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Children</sc></p>

<p>Were never orphans had so dear a loss.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Was never mother had so dear a loss.</p>

<p>Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.</p>

<p>Their woes are parceled; mine is general.</p>

<p>She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;</p>

<p>I for a Clarence weep; so doth not she.</p>

<p>These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I;</p>

<p>I for an Edward weep; so do not they.</p>

<p>Alas, you three, on me, threefold distressed,</p>

<p>Pour all your tears. I am your sorrow’s nurse,</p>

<p>And I will pamper it with lamentation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorset</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeased</p>

<p>That you take with unthankfulness His doing.</p>

<p>In common worldly things, ’tis called ungrateful</p>

<p>With dull unwillingness to repay a debt</p>

<p>Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;</p>

<p>Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,</p>

<p>For it requires the royal debt it lent you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc></p>

<p>Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,</p>

<p>Of the young prince your son. Send straight for</p>

<p>him.</p>

<p>Let him be crowned. In him your comfort lives.</p>

<p>Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward’s grave</p>

<p>And plant your joys in living Edward’s throne.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester, Buckingham, Lord</p>

<p>Stanley, Earl of Derby, Hastings, and Ratcliffe.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[to Queen Elizabeth]</i></p>

<p>Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause</p>

<p>To wail the dimming of our shining star,</p>

<p>But none can help our harms by wailing them.–</p>

<p>Madam my mother, I do cry you mercy;</p>

<p>I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee</p>

<p>I crave your blessing.     <i><i>[He kneels.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>God bless thee, and put meekness in thy breast,</p>

<p>Love, charity, obedience, and true duty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc> <i>[standing]</i></p>

<p>Amen. <i>[Aside.]</i> And make me die a good old man!</p>

<p>That is the butt end of a mother’s blessing;</p>

<p>I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers</p>

<p>That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,</p>

<p>Now cheer each other in each other’s love.</p>

<p>Though we have spent our harvest of this king,</p>

<p>We are to reap the harvest of his son.</p>

<p>The broken rancor of your high-swoll’n hates,</p>

<p>But lately splintered, knit, and joined together,</p>

<p>Must gently be preserved, cherished, and kept.</p>

<p>Meseemeth good that with some little train</p>

<p>Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet</p>

<p>Hither to London, to be crowned our king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc></p>

<p>Why “with some little train,” my lord of</p>

<p>Buckingham?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude</p>

<p>The new-healed wound of malice should break out,</p>

<p>Which would be so much the more dangerous</p>

<p>By how much the estate is green and yet</p>

<p>ungoverned.</p>

<p>Where every horse bears his commanding rein</p>

<p>And may direct his course as please himself,</p>

<p>As well the fear of harm as harm apparent,</p>

<p>In my opinion, ought to be prevented.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I hope the King made peace with all of us;</p>

<p>And the compact is firm and true in me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rivers</sc></p>

<p>And so in me, and so, I think, in all.</p>

<p>Yet since it is but green, it should be put</p>

<p>To no apparent likelihood of breach,</p>

<p>Which haply by much company might be urged.</p>

<p>Therefore I say with noble Buckingham</p>

<p>That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hastings</sc>  And so say I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Then be it so, and go we to determine</p>

<p>Who they shall be that straight shall post to</p>

<p>Ludlow.–</p>

<p>Madam, and you, my sister, will you go</p>

<p>To give your censures in this business?</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Buckingham and Richard exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,</p>

<p>For God’s sake let not us two stay at home.</p>

<p>For by the way I’ll sort occasion,</p>

<p>As index to the story we late talked of,</p>

<p>To part the Queen’s proud kindred from the Prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>My other self, my council’s consistory,</p>

<p>My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,</p>

<p>I, as a child, will go by thy direction.</p>

<p>Toward Ludlow then, for we’ll not stay behind.</p>
