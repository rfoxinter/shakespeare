<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Now climbeth Tamora Olympus’ top,</p>

<p>Safe out of Fortune’s shot, and sits aloft,</p>

<p>Secure of thunder’s crack or lightning flash,</p>

<p>Advanced above pale Envy’s threat’ning reach.</p>

<p>As when the golden sun salutes the morn</p>

<p>And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,</p>

<p>Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach</p>

<p>And overlooks the highest-peering hills,</p>

<p>So Tamora.</p>

<p>Upon her wit doth earthly honor wait,</p>

<p>And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.</p>

<p>Then, Aaron, arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts</p>

<p>To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,</p>

<p>And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long</p>

<p>Hast prisoner held, fettered in amorous chains</p>

<p>And faster bound to Aaron’s charming eyes</p>

<p>Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.</p>

<p>Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!</p>

<p>I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold</p>

<p>To wait upon this new-made emperess.</p>

<p>To wait, said I? To wanton with this queen,</p>

<p>This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,</p>

<p>This siren that will charm Rome’s Saturnine</p>

<p>And see his shipwrack and his commonweal’s.</p>

<p>Holla! What storm is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Chiron and Demetrius, braving.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>Chiron, thy years wants wit, thy wits wants edge</p>

<p>And manners, to intrude where I am graced,</p>

<p>And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>Demetrius, thou dost overween in all,</p>

<p>And so in this, to bear me down with braves.</p>

<p>’Tis not the difference of a year or two</p>

<p>Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate.</p>

<p>I am as able and as fit as thou</p>

<p>To serve and to deserve my mistress’ grace,</p>

<p>And that my sword upon thee shall approve</p>

<p>And plead my passions for Lavinia’s love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span> <i>[to Chiron]</i></p>

<p>Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,</p>

<p>Gave you a dancing rapier by your side,</p>

<p>Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?</p>

<p>Go to. Have your lath glued within your sheath</p>

<p>Till you know better how to handle it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,</p>

<p>Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>Ay, boy, grow you so brave?     <i><i>[They draw.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span>  Why, how now, lords?</p>

<p>So near the Emperor’s palace dare you draw</p>

<p>And maintain such a quarrel openly?</p>

<p>Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge.</p>

<p>I would not for a million of gold</p>

<p>The cause were known to them it most concerns,</p>

<p>Nor would your noble mother for much more</p>

<p>Be so dishonored in the court of Rome.</p>

<p>For shame, put up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span>  Not I, till I have sheathed</p>

<p>My rapier in his bosom, and withal</p>

<p>Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat</p>

<p>That he hath breathed in my dishonor here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>For that I am prepared and full resolved,</p>

<p>Foul-spoken coward, that thund’rest with thy tongue</p>

<p>And with thy weapon nothing dar’st perform.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span>  Away, I say!</p>

<p>Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore,</p>

<p>This petty brabble will undo us all.</p>

<p>Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous</p>

<p>It is to jet upon a prince’s right?</p>

<p>What, is Lavinia then become so loose</p>

<p>Or Bassianus so degenerate</p>

<p>That for her love such quarrels may be broached</p>

<p>Without controlment, justice, or revenge?</p>

<p>Young lords, beware! And should the Empress know</p>

<p>This discord’s ground, the music would not please.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>I care not, I, knew she and all the world.</p>

<p>I love Lavinia more than all the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice.</p>

<p>Lavinia is thine elder brother’s hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Why, are you mad? Or know you not in Rome</p>

<p>How furious and impatient they be,</p>

<p>And cannot brook competitors in love?</p>

<p>I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths</p>

<p>By this device.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span>  Aaron, a thousand deaths</p>

<p>Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>To achieve her how?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span>  Why makes thou it so strange?</p>

<p>She is a woman, therefore may be wooed;</p>

<p>She is a woman, therefore may be won;</p>

<p>She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.</p>

<p>What, man, more water glideth by the mill</p>

<p>Than wots the miller of, and easy it is</p>

<p>Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know.</p>

<p>Though Bassianus be the Emperor’s brother,</p>

<p>Better than he have worn Vulcan’s badge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>Then why should he despair that knows to court it</p>

<p>With words, fair looks, and liberality?</p>

<p>What, hast not thou full often struck a doe</p>

<p>And borne her cleanly by the keeper’s nose?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Why, then, it seems some certain snatch or so</p>

<p>Would serve your turns.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span>  Ay, so the turn were served.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span>  Aaron, thou hast hit it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span>  Would you had hit it too!</p>

<p>Then should not we be tired with this ado.</p>

<p>Why, hark you, hark you! And are you such fools</p>

<p>To square for this? Would it offend you then</p>

<p>That both should speed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>Faith, not me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span>  Nor me, so I were one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar.</p>

<p>’Tis policy and stratagem must do</p>

<p>That you affect, and so must you resolve</p>

<p>That what you cannot as you would achieve,</p>

<p>You must perforce accomplish as you may.</p>

<p>Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste</p>

<p>Than this Lavinia, Bassianus’ love.</p>

<p>A speedier course than ling’ring languishment</p>

<p>Must we pursue, and I have found the path.</p>

<p>My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;</p>

<p>There will the lovely Roman ladies troop.</p>

<p>The forest walks are wide and spacious,</p>

<p>And many unfrequented plots there are,</p>

<p>Fitted by kind for rape and villainy.</p>

<p>Single you thither then this dainty doe,</p>

<p>And strike her home by force, if not by words.</p>

<p>This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.</p>

<p>Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit</p>

<p>To villainy and vengeance consecrate,</p>

<p>Will we acquaint withal what we intend,</p>

<p>And she shall file our engines with advice</p>

<p>That will not suffer you to square yourselves,</p>

<p>But to your wishes’ height advance you both.</p>

<p>The Emperor’s court is like the house of Fame,</p>

<p>The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears;</p>

<p>The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull.</p>

<p>There speak and strike, brave boys, and take your</p>

<p>turns.</p>

<p>There serve your lust, shadowed from heaven’s eye,</p>

<p>And revel in Lavinia’s treasury.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream</p>

<p>To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits,</p>

<p>Per Stygia, per manes vehor.</p>
