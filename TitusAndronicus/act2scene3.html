<p><center><i>[Enter Aaron, alone, carrying a bag of gold.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>He that had wit would think that I had none,</p>

<p>To bury so much gold under a tree</p>

<p>And never after to inherit it.</p>

<p>Let him that thinks of me so abjectly</p>

<p>Know that this gold must coin a stratagem</p>

<p>Which, cunningly effected, will beget</p>

<p>A very excellent piece of villainy.     <i><i>[He hides the bag.]</i></i></p>

<p>And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest</p>

<p>That have their alms out of the Empress’ chest.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Tamora alone to Aaron the Moor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>My lovely Aaron, wherefore look’st thou sad,</p>

<p>When everything doth make a gleeful boast?</p>

<p>The birds chant melody on every bush,</p>

<p>The snakes lies rolled in the cheerful sun,</p>

<p>The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind</p>

<p>And make a checkered shadow on the ground.</p>

<p>Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,</p>

<p>And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,</p>

<p>Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,</p>

<p>As if a double hunt were heard at once,</p>

<p>Let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise.</p>

<p>And after conflict such as was supposed</p>

<p>The wand’ring prince and Dido once enjoyed</p>

<p>When with a happy storm they were surprised,</p>

<p>And curtained with a counsel-keeping cave,</p>

<p>We may, each wreathed in the other’s arms,</p>

<p>Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber,</p>

<p>Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds</p>

<p>Be unto us as is a nurse’s song</p>

<p>Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Madam, though Venus govern your desires,</p>

<p>Saturn is dominator over mine.</p>

<p>What signifies my deadly standing eye,</p>

<p>My silence, and my cloudy melancholy,</p>

<p>My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls</p>

<p>Even as an adder when she doth unroll</p>

<p>To do some fatal execution?</p>

<p>No, madam, these are no venereal signs.</p>

<p>Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,</p>

<p>Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.</p>

<p>Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,</p>

<p>Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,</p>

<p>This is the day of doom for Bassianus.</p>

<p>His Philomel must lose her tongue today,</p>

<p>Thy sons make pillage of her chastity</p>

<p>And wash their hands in Bassianus’ blood.</p>

<p><center><i>[He takes out a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>Seest thou this letter? Take it up, I pray thee,</p>

<p>And give the King this fatal-plotted scroll.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands her the paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now, question me no more. We are espied.</p>

<p>Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,</p>

<p>Which dreads not yet their lives’ destruction.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bassianus and Lavinia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>No more, great empress. Bassianus comes.</p>

<p>Be cross with him, and I’ll go fetch thy sons</p>

<p>To back thy quarrels, whatsoe’er they be.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassianus</span></p>

<p>Who have we here? Rome’s royal empress,</p>

<p>Unfurnished of her well-beseeming troop?</p>

<p>Or is it Dian, habited like her,</p>

<p>Who hath abandoned her holy groves</p>

<p>To see the general hunting in this forest?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>Saucy controller of my private steps,</p>

<p>Had I the power that some say Dian had,</p>

<p>Thy temples should be planted presently</p>

<p>With horns, as was Acteon’s, and the hounds</p>

<p>Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,</p>

<p>Unmannerly intruder as thou art.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lavinia</span></p>

<p>Under your patience, gentle empress,</p>

<p>’Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,</p>

<p>And to be doubted that your Moor and you</p>

<p>Are singled forth to try experiments.</p>

<p>Jove shield your husband from his hounds today!</p>

<p>’Tis pity they should take him for a stag.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassianus</span></p>

<p>Believe me, queen, your swarthy Cimmerian</p>

<p>Doth make your honor of his body’s hue,</p>

<p>Spotted, detested, and abominable.</p>

<p>Why are you sequestered from all your train,</p>

<p>Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed,</p>

<p>And wandered hither to an obscure plot,</p>

<p>Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,</p>

<p>If foul desire had not conducted you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lavinia</span></p>

<p>And being intercepted in your sport,</p>

<p>Great reason that my noble lord be rated</p>

<p>For sauciness.–I pray you, let us hence,</p>

<p>And let her joy her raven-colored love.</p>

<p>This valley fits the purpose passing well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassianus</span></p>

<p>The King my brother shall have notice of this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lavinia</span></p>

<p>Ay, for these slips have made him noted long.</p>

<p>Good king to be so mightily abused!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>Why, I have patience to endure all this.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Chiron and Demetrius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>How now, dear sovereign and our gracious mother,</p>

<p>Why doth your Highness look so pale and wan?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?</p>

<p>These two have ticed me hither to this place,</p>

<p>A barren, detested vale you see it is;</p>

<p>The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,</p>

<p>Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe.</p>

<p>Here never shines the sun, here nothing breeds,</p>

<p>Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven.</p>

<p>And when they showed me this abhorred pit,</p>

<p>They told me, here at dead time of the night</p>

<p>A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,</p>

<p>Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,</p>

<p>Would make such fearful and confused cries</p>

<p>As any mortal body hearing it</p>

<p>Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.</p>

<p>No sooner had they told this hellish tale</p>

<p>But straight they told me they would bind me here</p>

<p>Unto the body of a dismal yew</p>

<p>And leave me to this miserable death.</p>

<p>And then they called me foul adulteress,</p>

<p>Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms</p>

<p>That ever ear did hear to such effect.</p>

<p>And had you not by wondrous fortune come,</p>

<p>This vengeance on me had they executed.</p>

<p>Revenge it as you love your mother’s life,</p>

<p>Or be you not henceforth called my children.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span> <i>[drawing his dagger]</i></p>

<p>This is a witness that I am thy son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span> <i>[drawing his dagger]</i></p>

<p>And this for me, struck home to show my strength.</p>

<p><center><i>[They stab Bassianus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lavinia</span></p>

<p>Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,</p>

<p>For no name fits thy nature but thy own!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>Give me the poniard! You shall know, my boys,</p>

<p>Your mother’s hand shall right your mother’s wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her.</p>

<p>First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw.</p>

<p>This minion stood upon her chastity,</p>

<p>Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,</p>

<p>And with that painted hope braves your mightiness;</p>

<p>And shall she carry this unto her grave?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>And if she do, I would I were an eunuch!</p>

<p>Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,</p>

<p>And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>But when you have the honey you desire,</p>

<p>Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.–</p>

<p>Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy</p>

<p>That nice-preserved honesty of yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lavinia</span></p>

<p>O Tamora, thou bearest a woman’s face–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>I will not hear her speak. Away with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lavinia</span></p>

<p>Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span> <i>[to Tamora]</i></p>

<p>Listen, fair madam. Let it be your glory</p>

<p>To see her tears, but be your heart to them</p>

<p>As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lavinia</span></p>

<p>When did the tiger’s young ones teach the dam?</p>

<p>O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee.</p>

<p>The milk thou suck’st from her did turn to marble.</p>

<p>Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.</p>

<p>Yet every mother breeds not sons alike.</p>

<p><i>[To Chiron.]</i> Do thou entreat her show a woman’s pity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lavinia</span></p>

<p>’Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark.</p>

<p>Yet have I heard–O, could I find it now!–</p>

<p>The lion, moved with pity, did endure</p>

<p>To have his princely paws pared all away.</p>

<p>Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,</p>

<p>The whilst their own birds famish in their nests.</p>

<p>O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,</p>

<p>Nothing so kind, but something pitiful.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>I know not what it means.–Away with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lavinia</span></p>

<p>O, let me teach thee! For my father’s sake,</p>

<p>That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee,</p>

<p>Be not obdurate; open thy deaf ears.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>Hadst thou in person ne’er offended me,</p>

<p>Even for his sake am I pitiless.–</p>

<p>Remember, boys, I poured forth tears in vain</p>

<p>To save your brother from the sacrifice,</p>

<p>But fierce Andronicus would not relent.</p>

<p>Therefore away with her, and use her as you will;</p>

<p>The worse to her, the better loved of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lavinia</span></p>

<p>O Tamora, be called a gentle queen,</p>

<p>And with thine own hands kill me in this place!</p>

<p>For ’tis not life that I have begged so long;</p>

<p>Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>What begg’st thou, then? Fond woman, let me go!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lavinia</span></p>

<p>’Tis present death I beg, and one thing more</p>

<p>That womanhood denies my tongue to tell.</p>

<p>O, keep me from their worse-than-killing lust,</p>

<p>And tumble me into some loathsome pit</p>

<p>Where never man’s eye may behold my body.</p>

<p>Do this, and be a charitable murderer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee.</p>

<p>No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span> <i>[to Lavinia]</i></p>

<p>Away, for thou hast stayed us here too long!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lavinia</span> <i>[to Tamora]</i></p>

<p>No grace, no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature,</p>

<p>The blot and enemy to our general name,</p>

<p>Confusion fall–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>Nay, then, I’ll stop your mouth.–Bring thou her</p>

<p>husband.</p>

<p>This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.</p>

<p><center><i>[They put Bassianus’ body in the pit and</p>

<p>exit, carrying off Lavinia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>Farewell, my sons. See that you make her sure.</p>

<p>Ne’er let my heart know merry cheer indeed</p>

<p>Till all the Andronici be made away.</p>

<p>Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,</p>

<p>And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Aaron with two of Titus’ sons,</p>

<p>Quintus and Martius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Come on, my lords, the better foot before.</p>

<p>Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit</p>

<p>Where I espied the panther fast asleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Quintus</span></p>

<p>My sight is very dull, whate’er it bodes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>And mine, I promise you. Were it not for shame,</p>

<p>Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.</p>

<p><center><i>[He falls into the pit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Quintus</span></p>

<p>What, art thou fallen? What subtle hole is this,</p>

<p>Whose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers</p>

<p>Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood</p>

<p>As fresh as morning dew distilled on flowers?</p>

<p>A very fatal place it seems to me.</p>

<p>Speak, brother! Hast thou hurt thee with the fall?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>O, brother, with the dismal’st object hurt</p>

<p>That ever eye with sight made heart lament!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Now will I fetch the King to find them here,</p>

<p>That he thereby may have a likely guess</p>

<p>How these were they that made away his brother.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>Why dost not comfort me and help me out</p>

<p>From this unhallowed and bloodstained hole?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Quintus</span></p>

<p>I am surprised with an uncouth fear.</p>

<p>A chilling sweat o’erruns my trembling joints.</p>

<p>My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,</p>

<p>Aaron and thou look down into this den</p>

<p>And see a fearful sight of blood and death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Quintus</span></p>

<p>Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart</p>

<p>Will not permit mine eyes once to behold</p>

<p>The thing whereat it trembles by surmise.</p>

<p>O, tell me who it is, for ne’er till now</p>

<p>Was I a child to fear I know not what.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>Lord Bassianus lies berayed in blood,</p>

<p>All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,</p>

<p>In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Quintus</span></p>

<p>If it be dark, how dost thou know ’tis he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>Upon his bloody finger he doth wear</p>

<p>A precious ring that lightens all this hole,</p>

<p>Which like a taper in some monument</p>

<p>Doth shine upon the dead man’s earthy cheeks</p>

<p>And shows the ragged entrails of this pit.</p>

<p>So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus</p>

<p>When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.</p>

<p>O, brother, help me with thy fainting hand–</p>

<p>If fear hath made thee faint as me it hath–</p>

<p>Out of this fell devouring receptacle,</p>

<p>As hateful as Cocytus’ misty mouth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Quintus</span> <i>[reaching into the pit]</i></p>

<p>Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out,</p>

<p>Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,</p>

<p>I may be plucked into the swallowing womb</p>

<p>Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus’ grave.</p>

<p><center><i>[He pulls Martius’ hand.]</i></center></p>

<p>I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Quintus</span></p>

<p>Thy hand once more. I will not loose again</p>

<p>Till thou art here aloft or I below.</p>

<p>Thou canst not come to me. I come to thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[He falls in.]</i></center></p>

<p>and Aaron the Moor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span></p>

<p>Along with me! I’ll see what hole is here</p>

<p>And what he is that now is leapt into it.–</p>

<p>Say, who art thou that lately didst descend</p>

<p>Into this gaping hollow of the earth?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>The unhappy sons of old Andronicus,</p>

<p>Brought hither in a most unlucky hour</p>

<p>To find thy brother Bassianus dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span></p>

<p>My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest.</p>

<p>He and his lady both are at the lodge</p>

<p>Upon the north side of this pleasant chase.</p>

<p>’Tis not an hour since I left them there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>We know not where you left them all alive,</p>

<p>But, out alas, here have we found him dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Tamora, Titus Andronicus, and Lucius.]</i></center></p>

<p>Where is thy brother Bassianus?</p>

<p>Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound.</p>

<p>Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.</p>

<br/>

<p>Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,</p>

<p>The complot of this timeless tragedy,</p>

<p>And wonder greatly that man’s face can fold</p>

<p>In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.</p>

<p><center><i>[She giveth Saturnine a letter.]</i></center></p>

<p>Thou know’st our meaning. Look for thy reward</p>

<p>Among the nettles at the elder tree</p>

<p>Which overshades the mouth of that same pit</p>

<p>Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.</p>

<p>Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.</p>

<p>O Tamora, was ever heard the like?</p>

<p>This is the pit, and this the elder tree.–</p>

<p>High Emperor, upon my feeble knee</p>

<br/>

<p>If it be proved! You see it is apparent.</p>

<p>Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>Andronicus himself did take it up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail,</p>

<p>For by my father’s reverend tomb I vow</p>

<p>They shall be ready at your Highness’ will</p>

<p>To answer their suspicion with their lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span></p>

<p>Thou shalt not bail them. See thou follow me.–</p>

<p>Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers.</p>

<p>Let them not speak a word. The guilt is plain.</p>
