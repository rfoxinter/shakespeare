<p><center><i>[Enter Tamora and her two sons, disguised.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment</p>

<p>I will encounter with Andronicus</p>

<p>And say I am Revenge, sent from below</p>

<p>To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.</p>

<p>Knock at his study, where they say he keeps</p>

<p>To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge.</p>

<p>Tell him Revenge is come to join with him</p>

<p>And work confusion on his enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[They knock, and Titus (above) opens his study door.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Who doth molest my contemplation?</p>

<p>Is it your trick to make me ope the door,</p>

<p>That so my sad decrees may fly away</p>

<p>And all my study be to no effect?</p>

<p>You are deceived, for what I mean to do,</p>

<p>See here, in bloody lines I have set down,</p>

<p>And what is written shall be executed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>Titus, I am come to talk with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>No, not a word. How can I grace my talk,</p>

<p>Wanting a hand to give it action?</p>

<p>Thou hast the odds of me; therefore, no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>I am not mad. I know thee well enough.</p>

<p>Witness this wretched stump; witness these crimson</p>

<p>lines;</p>

<p>Witness these trenches made by grief and care;</p>

<p>Witness the tiring day and heavy night;</p>

<p>Witness all sorrow that I know thee well</p>

<p>For our proud empress, mighty Tamora.</p>

<p>Is not thy coming for my other hand?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora.</p>

<p>She is thy enemy, and I thy friend.</p>

<p>I am Revenge, sent from th’ infernal kingdom</p>

<p>To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind</p>

<p>By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.</p>

<p>Come down and welcome me to this world’s light.</p>

<p>Confer with me of murder and of death.</p>

<p>There’s not a hollow cave or lurking-place,</p>

<p>No vast obscurity or misty vale</p>

<p>Where bloody murder or detested rape</p>

<p>Can couch for fear but I will find them out,</p>

<p>And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,</p>

<p>Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Art thou Revenge? And art thou sent to me</p>

<p>To be a torment to mine enemies?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>I am. Therefore come down and welcome me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Do me some service ere I come to thee.</p>

<p>Lo, by thy side, where Rape and Murder stands,</p>

<p>Now give some surance that thou art Revenge:</p>

<p>Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot wheels,</p>

<p>And then I’ll come and be thy wagoner,</p>

<p>And whirl along with thee about the globe,</p>

<p>Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,</p>

<p>To hale thy vengeful wagon swift away,</p>

<p>And find out murderers in their guilty caves.</p>

<p>And when thy car is loaden with their heads,</p>

<p>I will dismount and by thy wagon wheel</p>

<p>Trot like a servile footman all day long,</p>

<p>Even from Hyperion’s rising in the east</p>

<p>Until his very downfall in the sea.</p>

<p>And day by day I’ll do this heavy task,</p>

<p>So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>These are my ministers and come with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Are they thy ministers? What are they called?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>Rape and Murder; therefore called so</p>

<p>’Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Good Lord, how like the Empress’ sons they are,</p>

<p>And you the Empress! But we worldly men</p>

<p>Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.</p>

<p>O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee,</p>

<p>And if one arm’s embracement will content thee,</p>

<p>I will embrace thee in it by and by.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits above.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>This closing with him fits his lunacy.</p>

<p>Whate’er I forge to feed his brainsick humors,</p>

<p>Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,</p>

<p>For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;</p>

<p>And, being credulous in this mad thought,</p>

<p>I’ll make him send for Lucius his son;</p>

<p>And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,</p>

<p>I’ll find some cunning practice out of hand</p>

<p>To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,</p>

<p>Or, at the least, make them his enemies.</p>

<p>See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Titus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee.</p>

<p>Welcome, dread Fury, to my woeful house.–</p>

<p>Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.</p>

<p>How like the Empress and her sons you are!</p>

<p>Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor.</p>

<p>Could not all hell afford you such a devil?</p>

<p>For well I wot the Empress never wags</p>

<p>But in her company there is a Moor;</p>

<p>And, would you represent our queen aright,</p>

<p>It were convenient you had such a devil.</p>

<p>But welcome as you are. What shall we do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>Show me a murderer; I’ll deal with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chiron</sc></p>

<p>Show me a villain that hath done a rape,</p>

<p>And I am sent to be revenged on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,</p>

<p>And I will be revenged on them all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc> <i>[to Demetrius]</i></p>

<p>Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,</p>

<p>And when thou findst a man that’s like thyself,</p>

<p>Good Murder, stab him; he’s a murderer.</p>

<p><i>[To Chiron.]</i> Go thou with him, and when it is thy</p>

<p>hap</p>

<p>To find another that is like to thee,</p>

<p>Good Rapine, stab him; he is a ravisher.</p>

<p><i>[To Tamora.]</i> Go thou with them; and in the</p>

<p>Emperor’s court</p>

<p>There is a queen attended by a Moor.</p>

<p>Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion,</p>

<p>For up and down she doth resemble thee.</p>

<p>I pray thee, do on them some violent death.</p>

<p>They have been violent to me and mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>Well hast thou lessoned us; this shall we do.</p>

<p>But would it please thee, good Andronicus,</p>

<p>To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,</p>

<p>Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,</p>

<p>And bid him come and banquet at thy house?</p>

<p>When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,</p>

<p>I will bring in the Empress and her sons,</p>

<p>The Emperor himself, and all thy foes,</p>

<p>And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,</p>

<p>And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.</p>

<p>What says Andronicus to this device?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc> <i>[calling]</i></p>

<p>Marcus, my brother, ’tis sad Titus calls.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Marcus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius.</p>

<p>Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths.</p>

<p>Bid him repair to me and bring with him</p>

<p>Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths.</p>

<p>Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are.</p>

<p>Tell him the Emperor and the Empress too</p>

<p>Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.</p>

<p>This do thou for my love, and so let him,</p>

<p>As he regards his aged father’s life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>This will I do, and soon return again.     <i><i>[Marcus exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>Now will I hence about thy business</p>

<p>And take my ministers along with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,</p>

<p>Or else I’ll call my brother back again</p>

<p>And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc> <i>[aside to Chiron and Demetrius]</i></p>

<p>What say you, boys? Will you abide with him</p>

<p>Whiles I go tell my lord the Emperor</p>

<p>How I have governed our determined jest?</p>

<p>Yield to his humor, smooth and speak him fair,</p>

<p>And tarry with him till I turn again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I knew them all, though they supposed me mad,</p>

<p>And will o’erreach them in their own devices–</p>

<p>A pair of cursed hellhounds and their dam!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc> <i>[aside to Tamora]</i></p>

<p>Madam, depart at pleasure. Leave us here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, Andronicus. Revenge now goes</p>

<p>To lay a complot to betray thy foes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[Tamora exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chiron</sc></p>

<p>Tell us, old man, how shall we be employed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Tut, I have work enough for you to do.–</p>

<p>Publius, come hither; Caius, and Valentine.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Publius, Caius, and Valentine enter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Publius</sc>  What is your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc>  Know you these two?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Publius</sc></p>

<p>The Empress’ sons, I take them–Chiron, Demetrius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Fie, Publius, fie, thou art too much deceived.</p>

<p>The one is Murder, and Rape is the other’s name;</p>

<p>And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.</p>

<p>Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.</p>

<p>Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,</p>

<p>And now I find it. Therefore bind them sure,</p>

<p>And stop their mouths if they begin to cry.</p>

<p><center><i>[Titus exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chiron</sc></p>

<p>Villains, forbear! We are the Empress’ sons.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Publius</sc></p>

<p>And therefore do we what we are commanded.–</p>

<p>Stop close their mouths; let them not speak a word.</p>

<p>Is he sure bound? Look that you bind them fast.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Titus Andronicus with a knife, and Lavinia</p>

<p>with a basin.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Come, come, Lavinia. Look, thy foes are bound.–</p>

<p>Sirs, stop their mouths. Let them not speak to me,</p>

<p>But let them hear what fearful words I utter.–</p>

<p>O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!</p>

<p>Here stands the spring whom you have stained with</p>

<p>mud,</p>

<p>This goodly summer with your winter mixed.</p>

<p>You killed her husband, and for that vile fault</p>

<p>Two of her brothers were condemned to death,</p>

<p>My hand cut off and made a merry jest,</p>

<p>Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear</p>

<p>Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,</p>

<p>Inhuman traitors, you constrained and forced.</p>

<p>What would you say if I should let you speak?</p>

<p>Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.</p>

<p>Hark, wretches, how I mean to martyr you.</p>

<p>This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,</p>

<p>Whiles that Lavinia ’tween her stumps doth hold</p>

<p>The basin that receives your guilty blood.</p>

<p>You know your mother means to feast with me,</p>

<p>And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.</p>

<p>Hark, villains, I will grind your bones to dust,</p>

<p>And with your blood and it I’ll make a paste,</p>

<p>And of the paste a coffin I will rear,</p>

<p>And make two pasties of your shameful heads,</p>

<p>And bid that strumpet, your unhallowed dam,</p>

<p>Like to the earth swallow her own increase.</p>

<p>This is the feast that I have bid her to,</p>

<p>And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;</p>

<p>For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,</p>

<p>And worse than Procne I will be revenged.</p>

<p>And now prepare your throats.–Lavinia, come,</p>

<p>Receive the blood.     <i><i>[He cuts their throats.]</i></i></p>

<p>And when that they are dead,</p>

<p>Let me go grind their bones to powder small,</p>

<p>And with this hateful liquor temper it,</p>

<p>And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.</p>

<p>Come, come, be everyone officious</p>

<p>To make this banquet, which I wish may prove</p>

<p>More stern and bloody than the Centaurs’ feast.</p>

<p>So. Now bring them in, for I’ll play the cook</p>

<p>And see them ready against their mother comes.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit, carrying the dead bodies.]</i></center></p>
