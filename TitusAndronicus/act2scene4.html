<p><center><i>[Enter the Empress’ sons, Demetrius and Chiron,</p>

<p>with Lavinia, her hands cut off, and her tongue cut out,</p>

<p>and ravished.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,</p>

<p>Who ’twas that cut thy tongue and ravished thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>Write down thy mind; bewray thy meaning so,</p>

<p>An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span> <i>[to Lavinia]</i></p>

<p>Go home. Call for sweet water; wash thy hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;</p>

<p>And so let’s leave her to her silent walks.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>An ’twere my cause, I should go hang myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.</p>

<p><center><i>[Chiron and Demetrius exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Marcus from hunting.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>Who is this? My niece, that flies away so fast?–</p>

<p>Cousin, a word. Where is your husband?</p>

<p>If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me.</p>

<p>If I do wake, some planet strike me down</p>

<p>That I may slumber an eternal sleep.</p>

<p>Speak, gentle niece. What stern ungentle hands</p>

<p>Hath lopped and hewed and made thy body bare</p>

<p>Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments</p>

<p>Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,</p>

<p>And might not gain so great a happiness</p>

<p>As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?</p>

<p>Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,</p>

<p>Like to a bubbling fountain stirred with wind,</p>

<p>Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,</p>

<p>Coming and going with thy honey breath.</p>

<p>But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee,</p>

<p>And lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue.</p>

<p>Ah, now thou turn’st away thy face for shame,</p>

<p>And notwithstanding all this loss of blood,</p>

<p>As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,</p>

<p>Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan’s face,</p>

<p>Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.</p>

<p>Shall I speak for thee, shall I say ’tis so?</p>

<p>O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,</p>

<p>That I might rail at him to ease my mind.</p>

<p>Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopped,</p>

<p>Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.</p>

<p>Fair Philomela, why she but lost her tongue,</p>

<p>And in a tedious sampler sewed her mind;</p>

<p>But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.</p>

<p>A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,</p>

<p>And he hath cut those pretty fingers off</p>

<p>That could have better sewed than Philomel.</p>

<p>O, had the monster seen those lily hands</p>

<p>Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute</p>

<p>And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,</p>

<p>He would not then have touched them for his life.</p>

<p>Or had he heard the heavenly harmony</p>

<p>Which that sweet tongue hath made,</p>

<p>He would have dropped his knife and fell asleep,</p>

<p>As Cerberus at the Thracian poet’s feet.</p>

<p>Come, let us go and make thy father blind,</p>

<p>For such a sight will blind a father’s eye.</p>

<p>One hour’s storm will drown the fragrant meads;</p>

<p>What will whole months of tears thy father’s eyes?</p>

<p>Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee.</p>

<p>O, could our mourning ease thy misery!</p>
