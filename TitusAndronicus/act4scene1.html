<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius’ son and Lavinia running after him, and</p>

<p>the boy flies from her with his books under his arm.</p>

<p>Enter Titus and Marcus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Help, grandsire, help! My aunt Lavinia</p>

<p>Follows me everywhere, I know not why.–</p>

<p>Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes!–</p>

<p>Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>Stand by me, Lucius. Do not fear thine aunt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Fear her not, Lucius. Somewhat doth she mean.</p>

<p>See, Lucius, see, how much she makes of thee.</p>

<p>Somewhither would she have thee go with her.</p>

<p>Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care</p>

<p>Read to her sons than she hath read to thee</p>

<p>Sweet poetry and Tully’s Orator.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,</p>

<p>Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her;</p>

<p>For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,</p>

<p>Extremity of griefs would make men mad,</p>

<p>And I have read that Hecuba of Troy</p>

<p>Ran mad for sorrow. That made me to fear,</p>

<p>Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt</p>

<p>Loves me as dear as e’er my mother did,</p>

<p>And would not but in fury fright my youth,</p>

<p>Which made me down to throw my books and fly,</p>

<p>Causeless, perhaps.–But pardon me, sweet aunt.</p>

<p>And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,</p>

<p>I will most willingly attend your Ladyship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span>  Lucius, I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>How now, Lavinia?–Marcus, what means this?</p>

<p>Some book there is that she desires to see.–</p>

<p>Which is it, girl, of these?–Open them, boy.–</p>

<p><i>[To Lavinia.]</i> But thou art deeper read and better</p>

<p>skilled.</p>

<p>Come and take choice of all my library,</p>

<p>And so beguile thy sorrow till the heavens</p>

<p>Reveal the damned contriver of this deed.–</p>

<p>Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>I think she means that there were more than one</p>

<p>Confederate in the fact. Ay, more there was,</p>

<p>Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Grandsire, ’tis Ovid’s Metamorphosis.</p>

<p>My mother gave it me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span>  For love of her that’s gone,</p>

<p>Perhaps, she culled it from among the rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Soft! So busily she turns the leaves.</p>

<p>Help her! What would she find?–Lavinia, shall I read?</p>

<p>This is the tragic tale of Philomel,</p>

<p>And treats of Tereus’ treason and his rape.</p>

<p>And rape, I fear, was root of thy annoy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,</p>

<p>Ravished and wronged as Philomela was,</p>

<p>Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods?</p>

<p>See, see! Ay, such a place there is where we did hunt–</p>

<p>O, had we never, never hunted there!–</p>

<p>Patterned by that the poet here describes,</p>

<p>By nature made for murders and for rapes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>O, why should nature build so foul a den,</p>

<p>Unless the gods delight in tragedies?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,</p>

<p>What Roman lord it was durst do the deed.</p>

<p>Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,</p>

<p>That left the camp to sin in Lucrece’ bed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>Sit down, sweet niece.–Brother, sit down by me.</p>

<p><center><i>[They sit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury</p>

<p>Inspire me, that I may this treason find.–</p>

<p>My lord, look here.–Look here, Lavinia.</p>

<p><center><i>[He writes his name with his staff and guides it</p>

<p>with feet and mouth.]</i></center></p>

<p>This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst,</p>

<p>This after me. I have writ my name</p>

<p>Without the help of any hand at all.</p>

<p>Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!</p>

<p>Write thou, good niece, and here display at last</p>

<p>What God will have discovered for revenge.</p>

<p>Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,</p>

<p>That we may know the traitors and the truth.</p>

<p><center><i>[She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it</p>

<p>with her stumps and writes.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, do you read, my lord, what she hath writ?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>“Stuprum. Chiron, Demetrius.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>What, what! The lustful sons of Tamora</p>

<p>Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span>  Magni Dominator poli,</p>

<p>Tam lentus audis scelera, tam lentus vides?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>O, calm thee, gentle lord, although I know</p>

<p>There is enough written upon this earth</p>

<p>To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts</p>

<p>And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.</p>

<p>My lord, kneel down with me.–Lavinia, kneel.–</p>

<p>And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector’s hope,</p>

<p><center><i>[They all kneel.]</i></center></p>

<p>And swear with me–as, with the woeful fere</p>

<p>And father of that chaste dishonored dame,</p>

<p>Lord Junius Brutus swore for Lucrece’ rape–</p>

<p>That we will prosecute by good advice</p>

<p>Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,</p>

<p>And see their blood or die with this reproach.</p>

<p><center><i>[They rise.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>’Tis sure enough, an you knew how.</p>

<p>But if you hunt these bearwhelps, then beware;</p>

<p>The dam will wake an if she wind you once.</p>

<p>She’s with the lion deeply still in league,</p>

<p>And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back;</p>

<p>And when he sleeps will she do what she list.</p>

<p>You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let alone.</p>

<p>And come, I will go get a leaf of brass,</p>

<p>And with a gad of steel will write these words,</p>

<p>And lay it by. The angry northern wind</p>

<p>Will blow these sands like Sibyl’s leaves abroad,</p>

<p>And where’s our lesson then?–Boy, what say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>I say, my lord, that if I were a man,</p>

<p>Their mother’s bedchamber should not be safe</p>

<p>For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>Ay, that’s my boy! Thy father hath full oft</p>

<p>For his ungrateful country done the like.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Come, go with me into mine armory.</p>

<p>Lucius, I’ll fit thee, and withal my boy</p>

<p>Shall carry from me to the Empress’ sons</p>

<p>Presents that I intend to send them both.</p>

<p>Come, come. Thou ’lt do my message, wilt thou not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>No, boy, not so. I’ll teach thee another course.–</p>

<p>Lavinia, come.–Marcus, look to my house.</p>

<p>Lucius and I’ll go brave it at the court;</p>

<p>Ay, marry, will we, sir, and we’ll be waited on.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Marcus exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>O heavens, can you hear a good man groan</p>

<p>And not relent, or not compassion him?</p>

<p>Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,</p>

<p>That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart</p>

<p>Than foemen’s marks upon his battered shield,</p>

<p>But yet so just that he will not revenge.</p>

<p>Revenge the heavens for old Andronicus!</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
