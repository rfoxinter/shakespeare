<p><center><i>[Enter Titus, old Marcus, his son Publius, young</p>

<p>Lucius, and other gentlemen (Caius and Sempronius)</p>

<p>with bows, and Titus bears the arrows with letters on</p>

<p>the ends of them.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Come, Marcus, come. Kinsmen, this is the way.–</p>

<p>Sir boy, let me see your archery.</p>

<p>Look you draw home enough and ’tis there straight.–</p>

<p>Terras Astraea reliquit.</p>

<p>Be you remembered, Marcus, she’s gone, she’s fled.–</p>

<p>Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall</p>

<p>Go sound the ocean and cast your nets;</p>

<p>Happily you may catch her in the sea;</p>

<p>Yet there’s as little justice as at land.</p>

<p>No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it.</p>

<p>’Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,</p>

<p>And pierce the inmost center of the Earth.</p>

<p>Then, when you come to Pluto’s region,</p>

<p>I pray you, deliver him this petition.</p>

<p>Tell him it is for justice and for aid,</p>

<p>And that it comes from old Andronicus,</p>

<p>Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.</p>

<p>Ah, Rome! Well, well, I made thee miserable</p>

<p>What time I threw the people’s suffrages</p>

<p>On him that thus doth tyrannize o’er me.</p>

<p>Go, get you gone, and pray be careful all,</p>

<p>And leave you not a man-of-war unsearched.</p>

<p>This wicked emperor may have shipped her hence,</p>

<p>And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>O Publius, is not this a heavy case</p>

<p>To see thy noble uncle thus distract?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Publius</sc></p>

<p>Therefore, my lords, it highly us concerns</p>

<p>By day and night t’ attend him carefully,</p>

<p>And feed his humor kindly as we may,</p>

<p>Till time beget some careful remedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy</p>

<p>But ...</p>

<p>Join with the Goths, and with revengeful war</p>

<p>Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,</p>

<p>And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Publius, how now? How now, my masters?</p>

<p>What, have you met with her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Publius</sc></p>

<p>No, my good lord, but Pluto sends you word,</p>

<p>If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall.</p>

<p>Marry, for Justice, she is so employed,</p>

<p>He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,</p>

<p>So that perforce you must needs stay a time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.</p>

<p>I’ll dive into the burning lake below</p>

<p>And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.</p>

<p>Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we,</p>

<p>No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops’ size,</p>

<p>But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,</p>

<p>Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can</p>

<p>bear;</p>

<p>And sith there’s no justice in Earth nor hell,</p>

<p>We will solicit heaven and move the gods</p>

<p>To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.</p>

<p>Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives them the arrows.]</i></center></p>

<p>“Ad Jovem,” that’s for you;–here, “Ad Apollinem”;–</p>

<p>“Ad Martem,” that’s for myself;–</p>

<p>Here, boy, “to Pallas”;–here, “to Mercury”;–</p>

<p>“To Saturn,” Caius–not to Saturnine!</p>

<p>You were as good to shoot against the wind.</p>

<p>To it, boy!–Marcus, loose when I bid.</p>

<p>Of my word, I have written to effect;</p>

<p>There’s not a god left unsolicited.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court.</p>

<p>We will afflict the Emperor in his pride.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Now, masters, draw. <i>[(They shoot.)]</i> O, well said,</p>

<p>Lucius!</p>

<p>Good boy, in Virgo’s lap! Give it Pallas.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon.</p>

<p>Your letter is with Jupiter by this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Ha, ha! Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?</p>

<p>See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus’ horns!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>This was the sport, my lord; when Publius shot,</p>

<p>The Bull, being galled, gave Aries such a knock</p>

<p>That down fell both the Ram’s horns in the court,</p>

<p>And who should find them but the Empress’ villain?</p>

<p>She laughed and told the Moor he should not choose</p>

<p>But give them to his master for a present.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Why, there it goes. God give his Lordship joy!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a country fellow with a basket and two</p>

<p>pigeons in it.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is</p>

<p>come.–</p>

<p>Sirrah, what tidings? Have you any letters?</p>

<p>Shall I have Justice? What says Jupiter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Country</sc> <sc>Fellow</sc>  Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that</p>

<p>he hath taken them down again, for the man must</p>

<p>not be hanged till the next week.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc>  But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Country</sc> <sc>Fellow</sc>  Alas, sir, I know not Jubiter; I never</p>

<p>drank with him in all my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc>  Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Country</sc> <sc>Fellow</sc>  Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc>  Why, didst thou not come from heaven?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Country</sc> <sc>Fellow</sc>  From heaven? Alas, sir, I never</p>

<p>came there. God forbid I should be so bold to press</p>

<p>to heaven in my young days. Why, I am going with</p>

<p>my pigeons to the tribunal plebs, to take up a matter</p>

<p>of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the Emperal’s</p>

<p>men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc> <i>[to Titus]</i>  Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to</p>

<p>serve for your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons</p>

<p>to the Emperor from you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc>  Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor</p>

<p>with a grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Country</sc> <sc>Fellow</sc>  Nay, truly, sir, I could never say</p>

<p>grace in all my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Sirrah, come hither. Make no more ado,</p>

<p>But give your pigeons to the Emperor.</p>

<p>By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.</p>

<p>Hold, hold; meanwhile here’s money for thy</p>

<p>charges.–Give me pen and ink.–Sirrah, can you</p>

<p>with a grace deliver up a supplication?</p>

<p><center><i>[He writes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Country</sc> <sc>Fellow</sc>  Ay, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc>  Then here is a supplication for you, and when</p>

<p>you come to him, at the first approach you must</p>

<p>kneel, then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons,</p>

<p>and then look for your reward. I’ll be at</p>

<p>hand, sir. See you do it bravely.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands him a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Country</sc> <sc>Fellow</sc>  I warrant you, sir. Let me alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Sirrah, hast thou a knife? Come, let me see it.–</p>

<p><center><i>[He takes the knife and gives it to Marcus.]</i></center></p>

<p>Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration,</p>

<p>For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.–</p>

<p>And when thou hast given it to the Emperor,</p>

<p>Knock at my door and tell me what he says.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Country</sc> <sc>Fellow</sc>  God be with you, sir. I will.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc>  Come, Marcus, let us go.–Publius, follow me.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
