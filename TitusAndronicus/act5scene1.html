<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter Lucius with an army of Goths, with</p>

<p>Drums and Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Approved warriors and my faithful friends,</p>

<p>I have received letters from great Rome</p>

<p>Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor</p>

<p>And how desirous of our sight they are.</p>

<p>Therefore, great lords, be as your titles witness,</p>

<p>Imperious, and impatient of your wrongs,</p>

<p>And wherein Rome hath done you any scathe,</p>

<p>Let him make treble satisfaction.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Goth</sc></p>

<p>Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus,</p>

<p>Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort,</p>

<p>Whose high exploits and honorable deeds</p>

<p>Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,</p>

<p>Be bold in us. We’ll follow where thou lead’st,</p>

<p>Like stinging bees in hottest summer’s day</p>

<p>Led by their master to the flowered fields,</p>

<p>And be avenged on cursed Tamora.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goths</sc></p>

<p>And as he saith, so say we all with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.</p>

<p>But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Goth, leading of Aaron with his child in his arms.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Goth</sc></p>

<p>Renowned Lucius, from our troops I strayed</p>

<p>To gaze upon a ruinous monastery,</p>

<p>And as I earnestly did fix mine eye</p>

<p>Upon the wasted building, suddenly</p>

<p>I heard a child cry underneath a wall.</p>

<p>I made unto the noise, when soon I heard</p>

<p>The crying babe controlled with this discourse:</p>

<p>“Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dame!</p>

<p>Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,</p>

<p>Had nature lent thee but thy mother’s look,</p>

<p>Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor.</p>

<p>But where the bull and cow are both milk white,</p>

<p>They never do beget a coal-black calf.</p>

<p>Peace, villain, peace!”–even thus he rates the babe–</p>

<p>“For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth</p>

<p>Who, when he knows thou art the Empress’ babe,</p>

<p>Will hold thee dearly for thy mother’s sake.”</p>

<p>With this, my weapon drawn, I rushed upon him,</p>

<p>Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither</p>

<p>To use as you think needful of the man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil</p>

<p>That robbed Andronicus of his good hand;</p>

<p>This is the pearl that pleased your empress’ eye;</p>

<p>And here’s the base fruit of her burning lust.–</p>

<p>Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey</p>

<p>This growing image of thy fiendlike face?</p>

<p>Why dost not speak? What, deaf? Not a word?–</p>

<p>A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,</p>

<p>And by his side his fruit of bastardy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>Touch not the boy. He is of royal blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Too like the sire for ever being good.</p>

<p>First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl,</p>

<p>A sight to vex the father’s soul withal.</p>

<p>Get me a ladder.</p>

<p><center><i>[A ladder is brought, which Aaron is made to climb.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc>  Lucius, save the child</p>

<p>And bear it from me to the Empress.</p>

<p>If thou do this, I’ll show thee wondrous things</p>

<p>That highly may advantage thee to hear.</p>

<p>If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,</p>

<p>I’ll speak no more but “Vengeance rot you all!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Say on, and if it please me which thou speak’st,</p>

<p>Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourished.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>And if it please thee? Why, assure thee, Lucius,</p>

<p>’Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;</p>

<p>For I must talk of murders, rapes, and massacres,</p>

<p>Acts of black night, abominable deeds,</p>

<p>Complots of mischief, treason, villainies,</p>

<p>Ruthful to hear, yet piteously performed.</p>

<p>And this shall all be buried in my death,</p>

<p>Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Tell on thy mind. I say thy child shall live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god.</p>

<p>That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>What if I do not? As indeed I do not.</p>

<p>Yet, for I know thou art religious</p>

<p>And hast a thing within thee called conscience,</p>

<p>With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies</p>

<p>Which I have seen thee careful to observe,</p>

<p>Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know</p>

<p>An idiot holds his bauble for a god</p>

<p>And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,</p>

<p>To that I’ll urge him. Therefore thou shalt vow</p>

<p>By that same god, what god soe’er it be</p>

<p>That thou adorest and hast in reverence,</p>

<p>To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up,</p>

<p>Or else I will discover naught to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Even by my god I swear to thee I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>O, most insatiate and luxurious woman!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity</p>

<p>To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.</p>

<p>’Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus.</p>

<p>They cut thy sister’s tongue, and ravished her,</p>

<p>And cut her hands, and trimmed her as thou sawest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>O detestable villain, call’st thou that trimming?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>Why, she was washed, and cut, and trimmed; and</p>

<p>’twas</p>

<p>Trim sport for them which had the doing of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>O, barbarous beastly villains, like thyself!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.</p>

<p>That codding spirit had they from their mother,</p>

<p>As sure a card as ever won the set;</p>

<p>That bloody mind I think they learned of me,</p>

<p>As true a dog as ever fought at head.</p>

<p>Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.</p>

<p>I trained thy brethren to that guileful hole</p>

<p>Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay.</p>

<p>I wrote the letter that thy father found,</p>

<p>And hid the gold within that letter mentioned,</p>

<p>Confederate with the Queen and her two sons.</p>

<p>And what not done that thou hast cause to rue,</p>

<p>Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</p>

<p>I played the cheater for thy father’s hand,</p>

<p>And, when I had it, drew myself apart</p>

<p>And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.</p>

<p>I pried me through the crevice of a wall</p>

<p>When, for his hand, he had his two sons’ heads,</p>

<p>Beheld his tears, and laughed so heartily</p>

<p>That both mine eyes were rainy like to his.</p>

<p>And when I told the Empress of this sport,</p>

<p>She sounded almost at my pleasing tale,</p>

<p>And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goth</sc></p>

<p>What, canst thou say all this and never blush?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.</p>

<p>Even now I curse the day–and yet, I think,</p>

<p>Few come within the compass of my curse–</p>

<p>Wherein I did not some notorious ill,</p>

<p>As kill a man, or else devise his death;</p>

<p>Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it;</p>

<p>Accuse some innocent and forswear myself;</p>

<p>Set deadly enmity between two friends;</p>

<p>Make poor men’s cattle break their necks;</p>

<p>Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night,</p>

<p>And bid the owners quench them with their tears.</p>

<p>Oft have I digged up dead men from their graves</p>

<p>And set them upright at their dear friends’ door,</p>

<p>Even when their sorrows almost was forgot,</p>

<p>And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,</p>

<p>Have with my knife carved in Roman letters</p>

<p>“Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.”</p>

<p>But I have done a thousand dreadful things</p>

<p>As willingly as one would kill a fly,</p>

<p>And nothing grieves me heartily indeed</p>

<p>But that I cannot do ten thousand more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Bring down the devil, for he must not die</p>

<p>So sweet a death as hanging presently.</p>

<p><center><i>[Aaron is brought down from the ladder.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>If there be devils, would I were a devil,</p>

<p>To live and burn in everlasting fire,</p>

<p>So I might have your company in hell</p>

<p>But to torment you with my bitter tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Aemilius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goth</sc></p>

<p>My lord, there is a messenger from Rome</p>

<p>Desires to be admitted to your presence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  Let him come near.     <i><i>[Aemilius comes forward.]</i></i></p>

<p>Welcome, Aemilius. What’s the news from Rome?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aemilius</sc></p>

<p>Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,</p>

<p>The Roman Emperor greets you all by me;</p>

<p>And, for he understands you are in arms,</p>

<p>He craves a parley at your father’s house,</p>

<p>Willing you to demand your hostages,</p>

<p>And they shall be immediately delivered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goth</sc>  What says our general?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Aemilius, let the Emperor give his pledges</p>

<p>Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,</p>

<p>And we will come. March away.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
