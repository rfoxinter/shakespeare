<p><center><i>[Enter the Judges and Senators with Titus’ two sons</p>

<p>(Quintus and Martius) bound, passing on the stage to</p>

<p>the place of execution, and Titus going before, pleading.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Hear me, grave fathers; noble tribunes, stay.</p>

<p>For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent</p>

<p>In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;</p>

<p>For all my blood in Rome’s great quarrel shed,</p>

<p>For all the frosty nights that I have watched,</p>

<p>And for these bitter tears which now you see,</p>

<p>Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,</p>

<p>Be pitiful to my condemned sons,</p>

<p>Whose souls is not corrupted as ’tis thought.</p>

<p>For two-and-twenty sons I never wept</p>

<p>Because they died in honor’s lofty bed.</p>

<p><center><i>[Andronicus lieth down, and the Judges pass by him.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[They exit with the prisoners as Titus continues speaking.]</i></center></p>

<p>For these, tribunes, in the dust I write</p>

<p>My heart’s deep languor and my soul’s sad tears.</p>

<p>Let my tears stanch the earth’s dry appetite.</p>

<p>My sons’ sweet blood will make it shame and blush.</p>

<p>O Earth, I will befriend thee more with rain</p>

<p>That shall distil from these two ancient ruins</p>

<p>Than youthful April shall with all his showers.</p>

<p>In summer’s drought I’ll drop upon thee still;</p>

<p>In winter with warm tears I’ll melt the snow</p>

<p>And keep eternal springtime on thy face,</p>

<p>So thou refuse to drink my dear sons’ blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius with his weapon drawn.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O reverend tribunes, O gentle aged men,</p>

<p>Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death,</p>

<p>And let me say, that never wept before,</p>

<p>My tears are now prevailing orators.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>O noble father, you lament in vain.</p>

<p>The Tribunes hear you not; no man is by,</p>

<p>And you recount your sorrows to a stone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.–</p>

<p>Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Why, ’tis no matter, man. If they did hear,</p>

<p>They would not mark me; if they did mark,</p>

<p>They would not pity me. Yet plead I must,</p>

<p>And bootless unto them.</p>

<p>Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones,</p>

<p>Who, though they cannot answer my distress,</p>

<p>Yet in some sort they are better than the Tribunes,</p>

<p>For that they will not intercept my tale.</p>

<p>When I do weep, they humbly at my feet</p>

<p>Receive my tears and seem to weep with me,</p>

<p>And were they but attired in grave weeds,</p>

<p>Rome could afford no tribunes like to these.</p>

<p>A stone is soft as wax, tribunes more hard than</p>

<p>stones;</p>

<p>A stone is silent and offendeth not,</p>

<p>And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.</p>

<p>But wherefore stand’st thou with thy weapon drawn?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>To rescue my two brothers from their death,</p>

<p>For which attempt the Judges have pronounced</p>

<p>My everlasting doom of banishment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc> <i>[rising]</i></p>

<p>O happy man, they have befriended thee!</p>

<p>Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive</p>

<p>That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?</p>

<p>Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey</p>

<p>But me and mine. How happy art thou then</p>

<p>From these devourers to be banished.</p>

<p>But who comes with our brother Marcus here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Marcus with Lavinia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,</p>

<p>Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break.</p>

<p>I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Will it consume me? Let me see it, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>This was thy daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc>  Why, Marcus, so she is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  Ay me, this object kills me!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Faint-hearted boy, arise and look upon her.–</p>

<p>Speak, Lavinia. What accursed hand</p>

<p>Hath made thee handless in thy father’s sight?</p>

<p>What fool hath added water to the sea</p>

<p>Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?</p>

<p>My grief was at the height before thou cam’st,</p>

<p>And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.–</p>

<p>Give me a sword. I’ll chop off my hands too,</p>

<p>For they have fought for Rome and all in vain;</p>

<p>And they have nursed this woe in feeding life;</p>

<p>In bootless prayer have they been held up,</p>

<p>And they have served me to effectless use.</p>

<p>Now all the service I require of them</p>

<p>Is that the one will help to cut the other.–</p>

<p>’Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,</p>

<p>For hands to do Rome service is but vain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Speak, gentle sister. Who hath martyred thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>O, that delightful engine of her thoughts,</p>

<p>That blabbed them with such pleasing eloquence,</p>

<p>Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage</p>

<p>Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung</p>

<p>Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>O, say thou for her who hath done this deed!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>O, thus I found her straying in the park,</p>

<p>Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer</p>

<p>That hath received some unrecuring wound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>It was my dear, and he that wounded her</p>

<p>Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead.</p>

<p>For now I stand as one upon a rock,</p>

<p>Environed with a wilderness of sea,</p>

<p>Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,</p>

<p>Expecting ever when some envious surge</p>

<p>Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.</p>

<p>This way to death my wretched sons are gone;</p>

<p>Here stands my other son a banished man,</p>

<p>And here my brother, weeping at my woes.</p>

<p>But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn</p>

<p>Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.</p>

<p>Had I but seen thy picture in this plight</p>

<p>It would have madded me. What shall I do,</p>

<p>Now I behold thy lively body so?</p>

<p>Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,</p>

<p>Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee.</p>

<p>Thy husband he is dead, and for his death</p>

<p>Thy brothers are condemned, and dead by this.–</p>

<p>Look, Marcus!–Ah, son Lucius, look on her!</p>

<p>When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears</p>

<p>Stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew</p>

<p>Upon a gathered lily almost withered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Perchance she weeps because they killed her husband,</p>

<p>Perchance because she knows them innocent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,</p>

<p>Because the law hath ta’en revenge on them.–</p>

<p>No, no, they would not do so foul a deed.</p>

<p>Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.–</p>

<p>Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips,</p>

<p>Or make some sign how I may do thee ease.</p>

<p>Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius</p>

<p>And thou and I sit round about some fountain,</p>

<p>Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks,</p>

<p>How they are stained like meadows yet not dry</p>

<p>With miry slime left on them by a flood?</p>

<p>And in the fountain shall we gaze so long</p>

<p>Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness</p>

<p>And made a brine pit with our bitter tears?</p>

<p>Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?</p>

<p>Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows</p>

<p>Pass the remainder of our hateful days?</p>

<p>What shall we do? Let us that have our tongues</p>

<p>Plot some device of further misery</p>

<p>To make us wondered at in time to come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Sweet father, cease your tears, for at your grief</p>

<p>See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Patience, dear niece.–Good Titus, dry thine eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot</p>

<p>Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,</p>

<p>For thou, poor man, hast drowned it with thine own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Mark, Marcus, mark. I understand her signs.</p>

<p>Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say</p>

<p>That to her brother which I said to thee.</p>

<p>His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,</p>

<p>Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.</p>

<p>O, what a sympathy of woe is this,</p>

<p>As far from help as limbo is from bliss.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Aaron the Moor alone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor</p>

<p>Sends thee this word, that if thou love thy sons,</p>

<p>Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,</p>

<p>Or any one of you, chop off your hand</p>

<p>And send it to the King; he for the same</p>

<p>Will send thee hither both thy sons alive,</p>

<p>And that shall be the ransom for their fault.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!</p>

<p>Did ever raven sing so like a lark,</p>

<p>That gives sweet tidings of the sun’s uprise?</p>

<p>With all my heart I’ll send the Emperor my hand.</p>

<p>Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Stay, father, for that noble hand of thine,</p>

<p>That hath thrown down so many enemies,</p>

<p>Shall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn.</p>

<p>My youth can better spare my blood than you,</p>

<p>And therefore mine shall save my brothers’ lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Which of your hands hath not defended Rome</p>

<p>And reared aloft the bloody battleax,</p>

<p>Writing destruction on the enemy’s castle?</p>

<p>O, none of both but are of high desert.</p>

<p>My hand hath been but idle; let it serve</p>

<p>To ransom my two nephews from their death.</p>

<p>Then have I kept it to a worthy end.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,</p>

<p>For fear they die before their pardon come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>My hand shall go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  By heaven, it shall not go!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Sirs, strive no more. Such withered herbs as these</p>

<p>Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,</p>

<p>Let me redeem my brothers both from death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>And for our father’s sake and mother’s care,</p>

<p>Now let me show a brother’s love to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Agree between you. I will spare my hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  Then I’ll go fetch an ax.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc>  But I will use the ax.     <i><i>[Lucius and Marcus exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Come hither, Aaron. I’ll deceive them both.</p>

<p>Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>If that be called deceit, I will be honest</p>

<p>And never whilst I live deceive men so.</p>

<p>But I’ll deceive you in another sort,</p>

<p>And that you’ll say ere half an hour pass.</p>

<p><center><i>[He cuts off Titus’ hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius and Marcus again.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Now stay your strife. What shall be is dispatched.–</p>

<p>Good Aaron, give his Majesty my hand.</p>

<p>Tell him it was a hand that warded him</p>

<p>From thousand dangers. Bid him bury it.</p>

<p>More hath it merited; that let it have.</p>

<p>As for my sons, say I account of them</p>

<p>As jewels purchased at an easy price,</p>

<p>And yet dear, too, because I bought mine own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aaron</sc></p>

<p>I go, Andronicus, and for thy hand</p>

<p>Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> Their heads, I mean. O, how this villainy</p>

<p>Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!</p>

<p>Let fools do good and fair men call for grace;</p>

<p>Aaron will have his soul black like his face.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,</p>

<p>And bow this feeble ruin to the earth.     <i><i>[He kneels.]</i></i></p>

<p>If any power pities wretched tears,</p>

<p>To that I call. <i>[(Lavinia kneels.)]</i> What, wouldst thou</p>

<p>kneel with me?</p>

<p>Do, then, dear heart, for heaven shall hear our</p>

<p>prayers,</p>

<p>Or with our sighs we’ll breathe the welkin dim</p>

<p>And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds</p>

<p>When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>O brother, speak with possibility,</p>

<p>And do not break into these deep extremes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?</p>

<p>Then be my passions bottomless with them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>But yet let reason govern thy lament.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>If there were reason for these miseries,</p>

<p>Then into limits could I bind my woes.</p>

<p>When heaven doth weep, doth not the Earth o’erflow?</p>

<p>If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,</p>

<p>Threat’ning the welkin with his big-swoll’n face?</p>

<p>And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?</p>

<p>I am the sea. Hark how her sighs doth flow!</p>

<p>She is the weeping welkin, I the Earth.</p>

<p>Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;</p>

<p>Then must my Earth with her continual tears</p>

<p>Become a deluge, overflowed and drowned,</p>

<p>Forwhy my bowels cannot hide her woes</p>

<p>But like a drunkard must I vomit them.</p>

<p>Then give me leave, for losers will have leave</p>

<p>To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger with two heads and a hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid</p>

<p>For that good hand thou sent’st the Emperor.</p>

<p>Here are the heads of thy two noble sons,</p>

<p>And here’s thy hand in scorn to thee sent back.</p>

<p>Thy grief their sports, thy resolution mocked,</p>

<p>That woe is me to think upon thy woes</p>

<p>More than remembrance of my father’s death.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Now let hot Etna cool in Sicily,</p>

<p>And be my heart an everburning hell!</p>

<p>These miseries are more than may be borne.</p>

<p>To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,</p>

<p>But sorrow flouted at is double death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound</p>

<p>And yet detested life not shrink thereat!</p>

<p>That ever death should let life bear his name,</p>

<p>Where life hath no more interest but to breathe.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lavinia kisses Titus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless</p>

<p>As frozen water to a starved snake.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>When will this fearful slumber have an end?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Now farewell, flatt’ry; die, Andronicus.</p>

<p>Thou dost not slumber. See thy two sons’ heads,</p>

<p>Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here,</p>

<p>Thy other banished son with this dear sight</p>

<p>Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,</p>

<p>Even like a stony image cold and numb.</p>

<p>Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs.</p>

<p>Rent off thy silver hair, thy other hand,</p>

<p>Gnawing with thy teeth, and be this dismal sight</p>

<p>The closing up of our most wretched eyes.</p>

<p>Now is a time to storm. Why art thou still?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc>  Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.</p>

<p><center><i>[Titus and Lavinia rise.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Why, I have not another tear to shed.</p>

<p>Besides, this sorrow is an enemy</p>

<p>And would usurp upon my wat’ry eyes</p>

<p>And make them blind with tributary tears.</p>

<p>Then which way shall I find Revenge’s cave?</p>

<p>For these two heads do seem to speak to me</p>

<p>And threat me I shall never come to bliss</p>

<p>Till all these mischiefs be returned again</p>

<p>Even in their throats that hath committed them.</p>

<p>Come, let me see what task I have to do.</p>

<p>You heavy people, circle me about</p>

<p>That I may turn me to each one of you</p>

<p>And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.</p>

<p>The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,</p>

<p>And in this hand the other will I bear.–</p>

<p>And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employed in these arms.</p>

<p>Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy</p>

<p>teeth.–</p>

<p>As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight.</p>

<p>Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.</p>

<p>Hie to the Goths and raise an army there.</p>

<p>And if you love me, as I think you do,</p>

<p>Let’s kiss and part, for we have much to do.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Lucius exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father,</p>

<p>The woefull’st man that ever lived in Rome.</p>

<p>Farewell, proud Rome, till Lucius come again.</p>

<p>He loves his pledges dearer than his life.</p>

<p>Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister.</p>

<p>O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!</p>

<p>But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives</p>

<p>But in oblivion and hateful griefs.</p>

<p>If Lucius live he will requite your wrongs</p>

<p>And make proud Saturnine and his empress</p>

<p>Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen.</p>

<p>Now will I to the Goths and raise a power</p>
