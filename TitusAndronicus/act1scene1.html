<p>And countrymen, my loving followers,</p>

<p>Plead my successive title with your swords.</p>

<p>I am his firstborn son that was the last</p>

<p>That wore the imperial diadem of Rome.</p>

<p>Then let my father’s honors live in me,</p>

<p>Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,</p>

<p>And suffer not dishonor to approach</p>

<p>The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,</p>

<p>A special party, have by common voice,</p>

<p>In election for the Roman empery,</p>

<p>Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius</p>

<p>For many good and great deserts to Rome.</p>

<p>A nobler man, a braver warrior,</p>

<p>Lives not this day within the city walls.</p>

<p>He by the Senate is accited home</p>

<p>From weary wars against the barbarous Goths,</p>

<p>That with his sons, a terror to our foes,</p>

<p>Hath yoked a nation strong, trained up in arms.</p>

<p>Ten years are spent since first he undertook</p>

<p>This cause of Rome, and chastised with arms</p>

<p>Our enemies’ pride. Five times he hath returned</p>

<p>Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons</p>

<p>In coffins from the field.</p>

<p>And now at last, laden with honor’s spoils,</p>

<p>Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,</p>

<p>Renowned Titus flourishing in arms.</p>

<p>Let us entreat, by honor of his name</p>

<p>Whom worthily you would have now succeed,</p>

<p>Whom you pretend to honor and adore,</p>

<p>From whence at first she weighed her anchorage,</p>

<p>Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,</p>

<p>To resalute his country with his tears,</p>

<p>Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.</p>

<p>Thou great defender of this Capitol,</p>

<p>Stand gracious to the rites that we intend.</p>

<p>Romans, of five-and-twenty valiant sons,</p>

<p>Half of the number that King Priam had,</p>

<p>Behold the poor remains alive and dead.</p>

<p>These that survive let Rome reward with love;</p>

<p>These that I bring unto their latest home,</p>

<p>With burial amongst their ancestors.</p>

<p>Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,</p>

<p>Why suffer’st thou thy sons unburied yet</p>

<p>To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?</p>

<p>Make way to lay them by their brethren.</p>

<p><center><i>[They open the tomb.]</i></center></p>

<p>There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,</p>

<p>And sleep in peace, slain in your country’s wars.</p>

<p>O sacred receptacle of my joys,</p>

<p>Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,</p>

<p>How many sons hast thou of mine in store</p>

<p>That thou wilt never render to me more?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,</p>

<p>That we may hew his limbs and on a pile,</p>

<p>Ad manes fratrum, sacrifice his flesh</p>

<p>Before this earthy prison of their bones,</p>

<p>That so the shadows be not unappeased,</p>

<p>Nor we disturbed with prodigies on Earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>I give him you, the noblest that survives,</p>

<p>Stay, Roman brethren!–Gracious conqueror,</p>

<p>Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,</p>

<p>A mother’s tears in passion for her son.</p>

<p>And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,</p>

<p>O think my son to be as dear to me.</p>

<p>Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome</p>

<p>To beautify thy triumphs and return</p>

<p>Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,</p>

<p>But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets</p>

<p>For valiant doings in their country’s cause?</p>

<p>O, if to fight for king and commonweal</p>

<p>Were piety in thine, it is in these!</p>

<p><center><i>[She kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood.</p>

<p>Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?</p>

<p>Draw near them then in being merciful.</p>

<p>Sweet mercy is nobility’s true badge.</p>

<p>Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.</p>

<p>These are their brethren whom your Goths beheld</p>

<p>Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain</p>

<p>Religiously they ask a sacrifice.</p>

<p>To this your son is marked, and die he must,</p>

<p>T’ appease their groaning shadows that are gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Alarbus goes to rest and we survive</p>

<p>Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal</p>

<p>The selfsame gods that armed the Queen of Troy</p>

<p>With opportunity of sharp revenge</p>

<p>Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent</p>

<p>May favor Tamora the Queen of Goths</p>

<p>(When Goths were Goths, and Tamora was queen)</p>

<p>To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the sons of Andronicus again with bloody swords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>See, lord and father, how we have performed</p>

<p>Our Roman rites. Alarbus’ limbs are lopped,</p>

<p>And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,</p>

<p>Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.</p>

<p>Remaineth naught but to inter our brethren,</p>

<p>And with loud larums welcome them to Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Let it be so. And let Andronicus</p>

<p>Make this his latest farewell to their souls.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sound trumpets, and lay the coffin in the tomb.]</i></center></p>

<p>In peace and honor rest you here, my sons,</p>

<p>Rome’s readiest champions, repose you here in rest,</p>

<p>Secure from worldly chances and mishaps.</p>

<p>Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,</p>

<p>Here grow no damned drugs; here are no storms,</p>

<p>No noise, but silence and eternal sleep.</p>

<p>In peace and honor rest you here, my sons.</p>

<p>In peace and honor live Lord Titus long;</p>

<p>My noble lord and father, live in fame.</p>

<p><center><i>[She kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears</p>

<p>I render for my brethren’s obsequies,</p>

<p>And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy</p>

<p>Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome.</p>

<p>O bless me here with thy victorious hand,</p>

<p>Whose fortunes Rome’s best citizens applaud.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved</p>

<p>The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!–</p>

<p>You that survive, and you that sleep in fame.</p>

<p>Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,</p>

<p>That in your country’s service drew your swords;</p>

<p>But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,</p>

<p>That hath aspired to Solon’s happiness,</p>

<p>And triumphs over chance in honor’s bed.–</p>

<p>Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,</p>

<p>Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,</p>

<p>Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,</p>

<p>This palliament of white and spotless hue,</p>

<p>And name thee in election for the empire</p>

<p>Be candidatus, then, and put it on</p>

<p>And help to set a head on headless Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,</p>

<p>And led my country’s strength successfully,</p>

<p>And buried one and twenty valiant sons,</p>

<p>Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span>  Patience, Prince Saturninus.</p>

<p>I will most thankful be, and thanks, to men</p>

<p>Of noble minds, is honorable meed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>People of Rome, and people’s tribunes here,</p>

<p>I ask your voices and your suffrages.</p>

<p>Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tribunes</span></p>

<p>And gratulate his safe return to Rome,</p>

<p>Tribunes, I thank you, and this suit I make:</p>

<p>That you create our emperor’s eldest son,</p>

<p>Lord Saturnine, whose virtues will, I hope,</p>

<p>Reflect on Rome as Titan’s rays on Earth</p>

<p>Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,</p>

<p>And will create thee Emperess of Rome.</p>

<p>Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my</p>

<p>choice?</p>

<p>And here I swear by all the Roman gods,</p>

<p>Sith priest and holy water are so near,</p>

<p>And tapers burn so bright, and everything</p>

<p>In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,</p>

<p>I will not resalute the streets of Rome</p>

<p>Or climb my palace till from forth this place</p>

<p>I lead espoused my bride along with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear,</p>

<p>If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,</p>

<p>She will a handmaid be to his desires,</p>

<p>A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span></p>

<p>Ascend, fair queen, to Pantheon.–Lords, accompany</p>

<p>Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,</p>

<p>Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,</p>

<p>Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered.</p>

<p>There shall we consummate our spousal rites.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Titus exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>I am not bid to wait upon this bride.</p>

<p>Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,</p>

<p>Dishonored thus and challenged of wrongs?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Marcus and Titus’ sons Lucius, Martius,</p>

<p>and Quintus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>O Titus, see! O, see what thou hast done!</p>

<p>In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,</p>

<p>Nor thou, nor these confederates in the deed</p>

<p>That hath dishonored all our family.</p>

<p>Unworthy brother and unworthy sons!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>But let us give him burial as becomes,</p>

<p>Give Mutius burial with our brethren.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Traitors, away! He rests not in this tomb.</p>

<p>This monument five hundred years hath stood,</p>

<p>Which I have sumptuously reedified.</p>

<p>Here none but soldiers and Rome’s servitors</p>

<p>Repose in fame, none basely slain in brawls.</p>

<p>Bury him where you can. He comes not here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>My lord, this is impiety in you.</p>

<p>My nephew Mutius’ deeds do plead for him.</p>

<p>He must be buried with his brethren.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>And shall, or him we will accompany.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>“And shall”? What villain was it spake that word?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>He that would vouch it in any place but here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>What, would you bury him in my despite?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee</p>

<p>To pardon Mutius and to bury him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,</p>

<p>And with these boys mine honor thou hast wounded.</p>

<p>My foes I do repute you every one.</p>

<p>So trouble me no more, but get you gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Quintus</span></p>

<p>He is not with himself; let us withdraw.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>Not I, till Mutius’ bones be buried.</p>

<p><center><i>[The brother (Marcus) and the sons</p>

<p>(Lucius, Martius, and Quintus) kneel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>Brother, for in that name doth nature plead–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>Father, and in that name doth nature speak–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>Renowned Titus, more than half my soul–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Dear father, soul and substance of us all–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter</p>

<p>His noble nephew here in virtue’s nest,</p>

<p>That died in honor and Lavinia’s cause.</p>

<p>Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous.</p>

<p>The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax,</p>

<p>That slew himself, and wise Laertes’ son</p>

<p>Did graciously plead for his funerals.</p>

<p>Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy,</p>

<p>Be barred his entrance here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span>  Rise, Marcus, rise.</p>

<p><center><i>[They rise.]</i></center></p>

<p>The dismall’st day is this that e’er I saw,</p>

<p>To be dishonored by my sons in Rome.</p>

<p>Well, bury him, and bury me the next.</p>

<p><center><i>[They put Mutius in the tomb.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends’,</p>

<p>Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.</p>

<p><center><i>[They all except Titus kneel and say:]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>No man shed tears for noble Mutius.</p>

<p>He lives in fame, that died in virtue’s cause.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Marcus and Titus exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,</p>

<p>How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths</p>

<p>Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>I know not, Marcus, but I know it is.</p>

<p>Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell.</p>

<p>Is she not then beholding to the man</p>

<p>That brought her for this high good turn so far?</p>

<p>Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.</p>

<br/>

<p>Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,</p>

<p>’Tis good, sir, you are very short with us.</p>

<p>But if we live, we’ll be as sharp with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassianus</span></p>

<p>My lord, what I have done, as best I may,</p>

<p>Answer I must, and shall do with my life.</p>

<p>Only thus much I give your Grace to know:</p>

<p>By all the duties that I owe to Rome,</p>

<p>This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,</p>

<p>Is in opinion and in honor wronged,</p>

<p>That in the rescue of Lavinia</p>

<p>With his own hand did slay his youngest son,</p>

<p>In zeal to you, and highly moved to wrath</p>

<p>To be controlled in that he frankly gave.</p>

<p>Receive him then to favor, Saturnine,</p>

<p>That hath expressed himself in all his deeds</p>

<p>A father and a friend to thee and Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds.</p>

<p>’Tis thou, and those, that have dishonored me.</p>

<p>Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge</p>

<p>How I have loved and honored Saturnine.     <i><i>[He kneels.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span> <i>[to Saturninus]</i></p>

<p>My worthy lord, if ever Tamora</p>

<p>Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,</p>

<p>Then hear me speak indifferently for all,</p>

<p>And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span></p>

<p>What, madam, be dishonored openly,</p>

<p>And basely put it up without revenge?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend</p>

<p>I should be author to dishonor you.</p>

<p>But on mine honor dare I undertake</p>

<p>For good Lord Titus’ innocence in all,</p>

<p>Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs.</p>

<p>Then at my suit look graciously on him.</p>

<p>Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,</p>

<p>Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.</p>

<p><i>[Aside to Saturninus.]</i> My lord, be ruled by me; be</p>

<p>won at last.</p>

<p>Dissemble all your griefs and discontents.</p>

<p>You are but newly planted in your throne.</p>

<p>Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,</p>

<p>Upon a just survey take Titus’ part</p>

<p>And so supplant you for ingratitude,</p>

<p>Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin.</p>

<p>Yield at entreats, and then let me alone.</p>

<p>I’ll find a day to massacre them all</p>

<p>And raze their faction and their family,</p>

<p>The cruel father and his traitorous sons,</p>

<p>To whom I sued for my dear son’s life,</p>

<p>That you will be more mild and tractable.–</p>

<p>And fear not, lords–and you, Lavinia.</p>

<p>By my advice, all humbled on your knees,</p>

<p>And at my lovely Tamora’s entreats,</p>

<p>I do remit these young men’s heinous faults.</p>

<p>Stand up.     <i><i>[They rise.]</i></i></p>

<p>Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,</p>

<p>I found a friend, and sure as death I swore</p>

<p>I would not part a bachelor from the priest.</p>

<p>You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.–</p>
