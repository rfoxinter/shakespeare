<p><center><i>[Enter Aaron, Chiron, and Demetrius at one door, and at</p>

<p>the other door young Lucius and another, with a bundle</p>

<p>of weapons and verses writ upon them.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>Demetrius, here’s the son of Lucius.</p>

<p>He hath some message to deliver us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>My lords, with all the humbleness I may,</p>

<p>I greet your Honors from Andronicus–</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> And pray the Roman gods confound you both.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What’s the news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Lucius</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>That you are both deciphered, that’s the news,</p>

<p>For villains marked with rape.–May it please you,</p>

<p>My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me</p>

<p>The goodliest weapons of his armory</p>

<p>To gratify your honorable youth,</p>

<p>The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say,</p>

<p>And so I do, and with his gifts present</p>

<p>Your Lordships, that, whenever you have need,</p>

<p>You may be armed and appointed well,</p>

<p>And so I leave you both–<i>[(aside)]</i> like bloody villains.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits, with Attendant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>What’s here? A scroll, and written round about.</p>

<p>Let’s see:</p>

<p><i>[He reads:]</i>      <i>“Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Non eget Mauri iaculis, nec arcu.”</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>O, ’tis a verse in Horace; I know it well.</p>

<p>I read it in the grammar long ago.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!</p>

<p>Here’s no sound jest. The old man hath found their</p>

<p>guilt</p>

<p>And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines</p>

<p>That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.</p>

<p>But were our witty empress well afoot,</p>

<p>She would applaud Andronicus’ conceit.</p>

<p>But let her rest in her unrest awhile.–</p>

<p>And now, young lords, was ’t not a happy star</p>

<p>Led us to Rome, strangers, and, more than so,</p>

<p>Captives, to be advanced to this height?</p>

<p>It did me good before the palace gate</p>

<p>To brave the tribune in his brother’s hearing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>But me more good to see so great a lord</p>

<p>Basely insinuate and send us gifts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?</p>

<p>Did you not use his daughter very friendly?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>I would we had a thousand Roman dames</p>

<p>At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>A charitable wish, and full of love!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>And that would she, for twenty thousand more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>Come, let us go and pray to all the gods</p>

<p>For our beloved mother in her pains.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.</p>

<p><center><i>[Trumpets sound offstage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>Why do the Emperor’s trumpets flourish thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>Belike for joy the Emperor hath a son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span>  Soft, who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Nurse, with a blackamoor child in her arms.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Good morrow, lords.</p>

<p>O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Well, more or less, or ne’er a whit at all,</p>

<p>Here Aaron is. And what with Aaron now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>O, gentle Aaron, we are all undone!</p>

<p>Now help, or woe betide thee evermore.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!</p>

<p>What dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>O, that which I would hide from heaven’s eye,</p>

<p>Our empress’ shame and stately Rome’s disgrace.</p>

<p>She is delivered, lords, she is delivered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span>  To whom?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  I mean, she is brought abed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Well, God give her good rest. What hath he sent her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  A devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Why, then she is the devil’s dam. A joyful issue!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!</p>

<p>Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad</p>

<p>Amongst the fair-faced breeders of our clime.</p>

<p>The Empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,</p>

<p>And bids thee christen it with thy dagger’s point.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Zounds, you whore, is black so base a hue?</p>

<p><i>[To the baby.]</i> Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous</p>

<p>blossom, sure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span>  Villain, what hast thou done?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span>  That which thou canst not undo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span>  Thou hast undone our mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span>  Villain, I have done thy mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone her.</p>

<p>Woe to her chance, and damned her loathed choice!</p>

<p>Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span>  It shall not live.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span>  It shall not die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>Aaron, it must. The mother wills it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I</p>

<p>Do execution on my flesh and blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>I’ll broach the tadpole on my rapier’s point.</p>

<p>Nurse, give it me. My sword shall soon dispatch it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span> <i>[taking the baby]</i></p>

<p>Sooner this sword shall plow thy bowels up!</p>

<p>Stay, murderous villains, will you kill your brother?</p>

<p>Now, by the burning tapers of the sky</p>

<p>That shone so brightly when this boy was got,</p>

<p>He dies upon my scimitar’s sharp point</p>

<p>That touches this my firstborn son and heir.</p>

<p>I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus</p>

<p>With all his threat’ning band of Typhon’s brood,</p>

<p>Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war</p>

<p>Shall seize this prey out of his father’s hands.</p>

<p>What, what, you sanguine, shallow-hearted boys,</p>

<p>You white-limed walls, you alehouse painted signs!</p>

<p>Coal-black is better than another hue</p>

<p>In that it scorns to bear another hue;</p>

<p>For all the water in the ocean</p>

<p>Can never turn the swan’s black legs to white,</p>

<p>Although she lave them hourly in the flood.</p>

<p>Tell the Empress from me, I am of age</p>

<p>To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>My mistress is my mistress, this myself,</p>

<p>The vigor and the picture of my youth.</p>

<p>This before all the world do I prefer;</p>

<p>This maugre all the world will I keep safe,</p>

<p>Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>By this our mother is forever shamed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>Rome will despise her for this foul escape.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>I blush to think upon this ignomy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Why, there’s the privilege your beauty bears.</p>

<p>Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing</p>

<p>The close enacts and counsels of thy heart.</p>

<p>Here’s a young lad framed of another leer.</p>

<p>Look how the black slave smiles upon the father,</p>

<p>As who should say “Old lad, I am thine own.”</p>

<p>He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed</p>

<p>Of that self blood that first gave life to you,</p>

<p>And from that womb where you imprisoned were</p>

<p>He is enfranchised and come to light.</p>

<p>Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,</p>

<p>Although my seal be stamped in his face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,</p>

<p>And we will all subscribe to thy advice.</p>

<p>Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Then sit we down, and let us all consult.</p>

<p>My son and I will have the wind of you.</p>

<p>Keep there. Now talk at pleasure of your safety.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span> <i>[to the Nurse]</i></p>

<p>How many women saw this child of his?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Why, so, brave lords! When we join in league,</p>

<p>I am a lamb; but if you brave the Moor,</p>

<p>The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,</p>

<p>The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.</p>

<p><i>[To the Nurse.]</i> But say again, how many saw the</p>

<p>child?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>Cornelia the midwife and myself,</p>

<p>And no one else but the delivered Empress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>The Empress, the midwife, and yourself.</p>

<p>Two may keep counsel when the third’s away.</p>

<p>Go to the Empress; tell her this I said.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kills her.]</i></center></p>

<p>“Wheak, wheak”! So cries a pig prepared to the spit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>What mean’st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>O Lord, sir, ’tis a deed of policy.</p>

<p>Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,</p>

<p>A long-tongued babbling gossip? No, lords, no.</p>

<p>And now be it known to you my full intent:</p>

<p>Not far one Muliteus my countryman</p>

<p>His wife but yesternight was brought to bed.</p>

<p>His child is like to her, fair as you are.</p>

<p>Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,</p>

<p>And tell them both the circumstance of all,</p>

<p>And how by this their child shall be advanced</p>

<p>And be received for the Emperor’s heir,</p>

<p>And substituted in the place of mine,</p>

<p>To calm this tempest whirling in the court;</p>

<p>And let the Emperor dandle him for his own.</p>

<p>Hark you, lords, you see I have given her physic,</p>

<p><center><i>[indicating the Nurse]</i></center></p>

<p>And you must needs bestow her funeral.</p>

<p>The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms.</p>

<p>This done, see that you take no longer days,</p>

<p>But send the midwife presently to me.</p>

<p>The midwife and the nurse well made away,</p>

<p>Then let the ladies tattle what they please.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chiron</span></p>

<p>Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air</p>

<p>With secrets.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span>  For this care of Tamora,</p>

<p>Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[Demetrius and Chiron exit,</p>

<p>carrying the Nurse’s body.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,</p>

<p>There to dispose this treasure in mine arms</p>

<p>And secretly to greet the Empress’ friends.–</p>

<p>Come on, you thick-lipped slave, I’ll bear you hence,</p>

<p>For it is you that puts us to our shifts.</p>

<p>I’ll make you feed on berries and on roots,</p>

<p>And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,</p>

<p>And cabin in a cave, and bring you up</p>

<p>To be a warrior and command a camp.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with the baby.]</i></center></p>
