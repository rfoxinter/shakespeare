<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius, Marcus, and the Goths, with Aaron,</p>

<p>Guards, and an Attendant carrying the baby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Uncle Marcus, since ’tis my father’s mind</p>

<p>That I repair to Rome, I am content.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Goth</span></p>

<p>And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,</p>

<p>This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil.</p>

<p>Let him receive no sust’nance. Fetter him</p>

<p>Till he be brought unto the Empress’ face</p>

<p>For testimony of her foul proceedings.</p>

<p>And see the ambush of our friends be strong.</p>

<p>I fear the Emperor means no good to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Some devil whisper curses in my ear</p>

<p>And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth</p>

<p>The venomous malice of my swelling heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Away, inhuman dog, unhallowed slave!–</p>

<p>Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sound trumpets.]</i></center></p>

<p>The trumpets show the Emperor is at hand.</p>

<p><center><i>[Guards and Aaron exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Emperor Saturninus and Empress Tamora</p>

<p>with Aemilius, Tribunes, Attendants, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span></p>

<p>What, hath the firmament more suns than one?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>Rome’s emperor, and nephew, break the parle.</p>

<p>These quarrels must be quietly debated.</p>

<p>The feast is ready which the careful Titus</p>

<p>Hath ordained to an honorable end,</p>

<p>For peace, for love, for league and good to Rome.</p>

<p>Please you therefore draw nigh and take your places.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span>  Marcus, we will.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Trumpets sounding, enter Titus like a cook, placing the</p>

<p>dishes, with young Lucius and others, and Lavinia</p>

<p>with a veil over her face.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Welcome, my lord;–welcome, dread queen;–</p>

<p>Welcome, you warlike Goths;–welcome, Lucius;–</p>

<p>And welcome, all. Although the cheer be poor,</p>

<p>’Twill fill your stomachs. Please you eat of it.</p>

<p><center><i>[They begin to eat.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span></p>

<p>Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Because I would be sure to have all well</p>

<p>To entertain your Highness and your empress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>An if your Highness knew my heart, you were.–</p>

<p>My lord the Emperor, resolve me this:</p>

<p>Was it well done of rash Virginius</p>

<p>To slay his daughter with his own right hand</p>

<p>Because she was enforced, stained, and deflowered?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span>  It was, Andronicus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span>  Your reason, mighty lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span></p>

<p>Because the girl should not survive her shame,</p>

<p>And by her presence still renew his sorrows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;</p>

<p>A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant</p>

<p>For me, most wretched, to perform the like.</p>

<p>Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee,</p>

<p>And with thy shame thy father’s sorrow die.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kills Lavinia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span></p>

<p>What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Killed her for whom my tears have made me blind.</p>

<p>I am as woeful as Virginius was,</p>

<p>And have a thousand times more cause than he</p>

<p>To do this outrage, and it now is done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span></p>

<p>What, was she ravished? Tell who did the deed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Will ’t please you eat?–Will ’t please your Highness</p>

<p>feed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tamora</span></p>

<p>Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Not I; ’twas Chiron and Demetrius.</p>

<p>They ravished her and cut away her tongue,</p>

<p>And they, ’twas they, that did her all this wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span></p>

<p>Go fetch them hither to us presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titus</span></p>

<p>Why, there they are, both baked in this pie,</p>

<p>Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,</p>

<p>Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.</p>

<p>’Tis true, ’tis true! Witness my knife’s sharp point.</p>

<p><center><i>[He stabs the Empress.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Saturninus</span></p>

<p>Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kills Titus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Can the son’s eye behold his father bleed?</p>

<p><center><i>[He kills Saturninus.]</i></center></p>

<p>There’s meed for meed, death for a deadly deed.</p>

<p><center><i>[A great tumult. Lucius, Marcus, and</p>

<p>others go aloft to the upper stage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,</p>

<p>By uproars severed as a flight of fowl</p>

<p>Scattered by winds and high tempestuous gusts,</p>

<p>O, let me teach you how to knit again</p>

<p>This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf,</p>

<p>These broken limbs again into one body,</p>

<p>Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,</p>

<p>And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,</p>

<p>Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,</p>

<p>Do shameful execution on herself.</p>

<p>But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,</p>

<p>Grave witnesses of true experience,</p>

<p>Cannot induce you to attend my words,</p>

<p><center><i>[He turns to Lucius.]</i></center></p>

<p>Speak, Rome’s dear friend, as erst our ancestor,</p>

<p>When with his solemn tongue he did discourse</p>

<p>To lovesick Dido’s sad-attending ear</p>

<p>The story of that baleful burning night</p>

<p>When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam’s Troy.</p>

<p>Tell us what Sinon hath bewitched our ears,</p>

<p>Or who hath brought the fatal engine in</p>

<p>That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.–</p>

<p>My heart is not compact of flint nor steel,</p>

<p>Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,</p>

<p>But floods of tears will drown my oratory</p>

<p>And break my utterance even in the time</p>

<p>When it should move you to attend me most</p>

<p>And force you to commiseration.</p>

<p>Here’s Rome’s young captain. Let him tell the tale,</p>

<p>While I stand by and weep to hear him speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Then, gracious auditory, be it known to you</p>

<p>That Chiron and the damned Demetrius</p>

<p>Were they that murdered our emperor’s brother,</p>

<p>And they it were that ravished our sister.</p>

<p>For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,</p>

<p>Our father’s tears despised, and basely cozened</p>

<p>Of that true hand that fought Rome’s quarrel out</p>

<p>And sent her enemies unto the grave;</p>

<p>Lastly, myself unkindly banished,</p>

<p>The gates shut on me, and turned weeping out</p>

<p>To beg relief among Rome’s enemies,</p>

<p>Who drowned their enmity in my true tears</p>

<p>And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.</p>

<p>I am the turned-forth, be it known to you,</p>

<p>That have preserved her welfare in my blood</p>

<p>And from her bosom took the enemy’s point,</p>

<p>Sheathing the steel in my advent’rous body.</p>

<p>Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;</p>

<p>My scars can witness, dumb although they are,</p>

<p>That my report is just and full of truth.</p>

<p>But soft, methinks I do digress too much,</p>

<p>Citing my worthless praise. O, pardon me,</p>

<p>For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>Now is my turn to speak. Behold the child.</p>

<p>Of this was Tamora delivered,</p>

<p>The issue of an irreligious Moor,</p>

<p>Chief architect and plotter of these woes.</p>

<p>The villain is alive in Titus’ house,</p>

<p>And as he is to witness, this is true.</p>

<p>Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge</p>

<p>These wrongs unspeakable, past patience,</p>

<p>Or more than any living man could bear.</p>

<p>Now have you heard the truth. What say you,</p>

<p>Romans?</p>

<p>Have we done aught amiss? Show us wherein,</p>

<p>And from the place where you behold us pleading,</p>

<p>The poor remainder of Andronici</p>

<p>Will, hand in hand, all headlong hurl ourselves,</p>

<p>And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls,</p>

<p>And make a mutual closure of our house.</p>

<p>Speak, Romans, speak, and if you say we shall,</p>

<p>Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aemilius</span></p>

<p>Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,</p>

<p>And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,</p>

<p>Lucius our emperor, for well I know</p>

<p>The common voice do cry it shall be so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romans</span></p>

<p>Lucius, all hail, Rome’s royal emperor!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span> <i>[to Attendants]</i></p>

<p>Go, go into old Titus’ sorrowful house,</p>

<p>And hither hale that misbelieving Moor</p>

<p>To be adjudged some direful slaught’ring death</p>

<p>As punishment for his most wicked life.</p>

<p><center><i>[Attendants exit. Lucius and Marcus</p>

<p>come down from the upper stage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romans</span></p>

<p>Lucius, all hail, Rome’s gracious governor!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Thanks, gentle Romans. May I govern so</p>

<p>To heal Rome’s harms and wipe away her woe!</p>

<p>But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,</p>

<p>For nature puts me to a heavy task.</p>

<p>Stand all aloof, but, uncle, draw you near</p>

<p>To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kisses Titus.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,</p>

<p>These sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstained face,</p>

<p>The last true duties of thy noble son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,</p>

<p>Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kisses Titus.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, were the sum of these that I should pay</p>

<p>Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span> <i>[to Young Lucius]</i></p>

<p>Come hither, boy. Come, come, and learn of us</p>

<p>To melt in showers. Thy grandsire loved thee well.</p>

<p>Many a time he danced thee on his knee,</p>

<p>Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow;</p>

<p>Many a story hath he told to thee,</p>

<p>And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind</p>

<p>And talk of them when he was dead and gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marcus</span></p>

<p>How many thousand times hath these poor lips,</p>

<p>When they were living, warmed themselves on thine!</p>

<p>O, now, sweet boy, give them their latest kiss.</p>

<p>Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave.</p>

<p>Do them that kindness, and take leave of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>O grandsire, grandsire, ev’n with all my heart</p>

<p>Would I were dead so you did live again!</p>

<p><center><i>[He kisses Titus.]</i></center></p>

<p>O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping.</p>

<p>My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Aaron with Guards.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roman</span></p>

<p>You sad Andronici, have done with woes.</p>

<p>Give sentence on this execrable wretch</p>

<p>That hath been breeder of these dire events.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Set him breast-deep in earth and famish him.</p>

<p>There let him stand and rave and cry for food.</p>

<p>If anyone relieves or pities him,</p>

<p>For the offense he dies. This is our doom.</p>

<p>Some stay to see him fastened in the earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aaron</span></p>

<p>Ah, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?</p>

<p>I am no baby, I, that with base prayers</p>

<p>I should repent the evils I have done.</p>

<p>Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did</p>

<p>Would I perform, if I might have my will.</p>

<p>If one good deed in all my life I did,</p>

<p>I do repent it from my very soul.</p>

<p><center><i>[Aaron is led off by Guards.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,</p>

<p>And give him burial in his fathers’ grave.</p>

<p>My father and Lavinia shall forthwith</p>

<p>Be closed in our household’s monument.</p>

<p>As for that ravenous tiger, Tamora,</p>

<p>No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weed;</p>

<p>No mournful bell shall ring her burial;</p>

<p>But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey.</p>

<p>Her life was beastly and devoid of pity,</p>

<p>And being dead, let birds on her take pity.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit, carrying the dead bodies.]</i></center></p>
