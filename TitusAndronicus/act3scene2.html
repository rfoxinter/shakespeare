<p><center><i>[A banquet. Enter Titus Andronicus, Marcus, Lavinia,</p>

<p>and the boy Young Lucius, with Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>So, so. Now sit, and look you eat no more</p>

<p>Than will preserve just so much strength in us</p>

<p>As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.</p>

<p>Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot.</p>

<p>Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands</p>

<p>And cannot passionate our tenfold grief</p>

<p>With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine</p>

<p>Is left to tyrannize upon my breast,</p>

<p>Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,</p>

<p>Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,</p>

<p>Then thus I thump it down.–</p>

<p>Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs,</p>

<p>When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,</p>

<p>Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.</p>

<p>Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;</p>

<p>Or get some little knife between thy teeth</p>

<p>And just against thy heart make thou a hole,</p>

<p>That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall</p>

<p>May run into that sink and, soaking in,</p>

<p>Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Fie, brother, fie! Teach her not thus to lay</p>

<p>Such violent hands upon her tender life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?</p>

<p>Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.</p>

<p>What violent hands can she lay on her life?</p>

<p>Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands,</p>

<p>To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o’er</p>

<p>How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?</p>

<p>O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,</p>

<p>Lest we remember still that we have none.–</p>

<p>Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,</p>

<p>As if we should forget we had no hands</p>

<p>If Marcus did not name the word of hands!</p>

<p>Come, let’s fall to, and, gentle girl, eat this.</p>

<p>Here is no drink!–Hark, Marcus, what she says.</p>

<p>I can interpret all her martyred signs.</p>

<p>She says she drinks no other drink but tears</p>

<p>Brewed with her sorrow, mashed upon her cheeks.–</p>

<p>Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought.</p>

<p>In thy dumb action will I be as perfect</p>

<p>As begging hermits in their holy prayers.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,</p>

<p>Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,</p>

<p>But I of these will wrest an alphabet</p>

<p>And by still practice learn to know thy meaning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Young</sc> <sc>Lucius</sc> <i>[weeping]</i></p>

<p>Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments.</p>

<p>Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,</p>

<p>Doth weep to see his grandsire’s heaviness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Peace, tender sapling. Thou art made of tears,</p>

<p>And tears will quickly melt thy life away.</p>

<p><center><i>[Marcus strikes the dish with a knife.]</i></center></p>

<p>What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>At that that I have killed, my lord, a fly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Out on thee, murderer! Thou kill’st my heart.</p>

<p>Mine eyes are cloyed with view of tyranny;</p>

<p>A deed of death done on the innocent</p>

<p>Becomes not Titus’ brother. Get thee gone.</p>

<p>I see thou art not for my company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Alas, my lord, I have but killed a fly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>“But”? How if that fly had a father and mother?</p>

<p>How would he hang his slender gilded wings</p>

<p>And buzz lamenting doings in the air!</p>

<p>Poor harmless fly,</p>

<p>That, with his pretty buzzing melody,</p>

<p>Came here to make us merry! And thou hast killed</p>

<p>him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Pardon me, sir. It was a black, ill-favored fly,</p>

<p>Like to the Empress’ Moor. Therefore I killed him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc>  O, O, O!</p>

<p>Then pardon me for reprehending thee,</p>

<p>For thou hast done a charitable deed.</p>

<p>Give me thy knife. I will insult on him,</p>

<p>Flattering myself as if it were the Moor</p>

<p>Come hither purposely to poison me.</p>

<p>There’s for thyself, and that’s for Tamora.</p>

<p>Ah, sirrah!</p>

<p>Yet I think we are not brought so low</p>

<p>But that between us we can kill a fly</p>

<p>That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcus</sc></p>

<p>Alas, poor man, grief has so wrought on him</p>

<p>He takes false shadows for true substances.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titus</sc></p>

<p>Come, take away.–Lavinia, go with me.</p>

<p>I’ll to thy closet and go read with thee</p>

<p>Sad stories chanced in the times of old.–</p>

<p>Come, boy, and go with me. Thy sight is young,</p>

<p>And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.</p>
