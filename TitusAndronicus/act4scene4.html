<p><center><i>[Enter Emperor Saturninus and Empress Tamora</p>

<p>and her two sons Chiron and Demetrius, with</p>

<p>Attendants. The Emperor brings the arrows in his</p>

<p>hand that Titus shot at him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saturninus</sc></p>

<p>Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen</p>

<p>An emperor in Rome thus overborne,</p>

<p>Troubled, confronted thus, and for the extent</p>

<p>Of equal justice, used in such contempt?</p>

<p>My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,</p>

<p>However these disturbers of our peace</p>

<p>Buzz in the people’s ears, there naught hath passed</p>

<p>But even with law against the willful sons</p>

<p>Of old Andronicus. And what an if</p>

<p>His sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits?</p>

<p>Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,</p>

<p>His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?</p>

<p>And now he writes to heaven for his redress!</p>

<p>See, here’s “to Jove,” and this “to Mercury,”</p>

<p>This “to Apollo,” this to the god of war.</p>

<p>Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!</p>

<p>What’s this but libeling against the Senate</p>

<p>And blazoning our unjustice everywhere?</p>

<p>A goodly humor is it not, my lords?</p>

<p>As who would say, in Rome no justice were.</p>

<p>But if I live, his feigned ecstasies</p>

<p>Shall be no shelter to these outrages,</p>

<p>But he and his shall know that justice lives</p>

<p>In Saturninus’ health, whom, if he sleep,</p>

<p>He’ll so awake as he in fury shall</p>

<p>Cut off the proud’st conspirator that lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,</p>

<p>Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,</p>

<p>Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus’ age,</p>

<p>Th’ effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,</p>

<p>Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his</p>

<p>heart,</p>

<p>And rather comfort his distressed plight</p>

<p>Than prosecute the meanest or the best</p>

<p>For these contempts. <i>[(Aside.)]</i> Why, thus it shall</p>

<p>become</p>

<p>High-witted Tamora to gloze with all.</p>

<p>But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick.</p>

<p>Thy lifeblood out, if Aaron now be wise,</p>

<p>Then is all safe, the anchor in the port.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Country Fellow.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, good fellow, wouldst thou speak with us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Country</sc> <sc>Fellow</sc>  Yea, forsooth, an your Mistresship be</p>

<p>emperial.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>Empress I am, but yonder sits the Emperor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Country</sc> <sc>Fellow</sc>  ’Tis he!–God and Saint Stephen</p>

<p>give you good e’en. I have brought you a letter and</p>

<p>a couple of pigeons here.</p>

<p><center><i>[Saturninus reads the letter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saturninus</sc></p>

<p>Go, take him away, and hang him presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Country</sc> <sc>Fellow</sc>  How much money must I have?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc>  Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Country</sc> <sc>Fellow</sc>  Hanged! By ’r Lady, then I have</p>

<p>brought up a neck to a fair end.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saturninus</sc></p>

<p>Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!</p>

<p>Shall I endure this monstrous villainy?</p>

<p>I know from whence this same device proceeds.</p>

<p>May this be borne?–as if his traitorous sons,</p>

<p>That died by law for murder of our brother,</p>

<p>Have by my means been butchered wrongfully!</p>

<p>Go, drag the villain hither by the hair.</p>

<p>Nor age nor honor shall shape privilege.</p>

<p>For this proud mock, I’ll be thy slaughterman,</p>

<p>Sly, frantic wretch, that holp’st to make me great</p>

<p>In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter nuntius, Aemilius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saturninus</sc>  What news with thee, Aemilius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aemilius</sc></p>

<p>Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.</p>

<p>The Goths have gathered head, and with a power</p>

<p>Of high-resolved men bent to the spoil,</p>

<p>They hither march amain under conduct</p>

<p>Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus,</p>

<p>Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do</p>

<p>As much as ever Coriolanus did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saturninus</sc></p>

<p>Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?</p>

<p>These tidings nip me, and I hang the head</p>

<p>As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms.</p>

<p>Ay, now begins our sorrows to approach.</p>

<p>’Tis he the common people love so much.</p>

<p>Myself hath often heard them say,</p>

<p>When I have walked like a private man,</p>

<p>That Lucius’ banishment was wrongfully,</p>

<p>And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saturninus</sc></p>

<p>Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius</p>

<p>And will revolt from me to succor him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>King, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name.</p>

<p>Is the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it?</p>

<p>The eagle suffers little birds to sing</p>

<p>And is not careful what they mean thereby,</p>

<p>Knowing that with the shadow of his wings</p>

<p>He can at pleasure stint their melody.</p>

<p>Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.</p>

<p>Then cheer thy spirit, for know, thou emperor,</p>

<p>I will enchant the old Andronicus</p>

<p>With words more sweet and yet more dangerous</p>

<p>Than baits to fish or honey-stalks to sheep,</p>

<p>Whenas the one is wounded with the bait,</p>

<p>The other rotted with delicious feed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saturninus</sc></p>

<p>But he will not entreat his son for us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>If Tamora entreat him, then he will,</p>

<p>For I can smooth and fill his aged ears</p>

<p>With golden promises, that were his heart</p>

<p>Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,</p>

<p>Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.</p>

<p><i>[To Aemilius.]</i> Go thou before to be our ambassador.</p>

<p>Say that the Emperor requests a parley</p>

<p>Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting</p>

<p>Even at his father’s house, the old Andronicus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saturninus</sc></p>

<p>Aemilius, do this message honorably,</p>

<p>And if he stand in hostage for his safety,</p>

<p>Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aemilius</sc></p>

<p>Your bidding shall I do effectually.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tamora</sc></p>

<p>Now will I to that old Andronicus</p>

<p>And temper him with all the art I have</p>

<p>To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.</p>

<p>And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,</p>

<p>And bury all thy fear in my devices.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saturninus</sc></p>

<p>Then go successantly, and plead to him.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
