<p><center><i>[Enter Macbeth’s Wife, alone, with a letter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc> <i>[reading the letter]</i>  They met me in the</p>

<p>day of success, and I have learned by the perfect’st</p>

<p>report they have more in them than mortal knowledge.</p>

<p>When I burned in desire to question them further, they</p>

<p>made themselves air, into which they vanished.</p>

<p>Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives</p>

<p>from the King, who all-hailed me “Thane of Cawdor,”</p>

<p>by which title, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me</p>

<p>and referred me to the coming on of time with “Hail,</p>

<p>king that shalt be.” This have I thought good to deliver</p>

<p>thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou</p>

<p>might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant</p>

<p>of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy</p>

<p>heart, and farewell.</p>

<p>Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be</p>

<p>What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature;</p>

<p>It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness</p>

<p>To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great,</p>

<p>Art not without ambition, but without</p>

<p>The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst</p>

<p>highly,</p>

<p>That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false</p>

<p>And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou ’dst have, great</p>

<p>Glamis,</p>

<p>That which cries “Thus thou must do,” if thou have</p>

<p>it,</p>

<p>And that which rather thou dost fear to do,</p>

<p>Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,</p>

<p>That I may pour my spirits in thine ear</p>

<p>And chastise with the valor of my tongue</p>

<p>All that impedes thee from the golden round,</p>

<p>Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem</p>

<p>To have thee crowned withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What is your tidings?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>The King comes here tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  Thou ’rt mad to say it.</p>

<p>Is not thy master with him, who, were ’t so,</p>

<p>Would have informed for preparation?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>So please you, it is true. Our thane is coming.</p>

<p>One of my fellows had the speed of him,</p>

<p>Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more</p>

<p>Than would make up his message.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  Give him tending.</p>

<p>He brings great news.     <i><i>[Messenger exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>The raven himself is hoarse</p>

<p>That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan</p>

<p>Under my battlements. Come, you spirits</p>

<p>That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,</p>

<p>And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full</p>

<p>Of direst cruelty. Make thick my blood.</p>

<p>Stop up th’ access and passage to remorse,</p>

<p>That no compunctious visitings of nature</p>

<p>Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between</p>

<p>Th’ effect and it. Come to my woman’s breasts</p>

<p>And take my milk for gall, you murd’ring ministers,</p>

<p>Wherever in your sightless substances</p>

<p>You wait on nature’s mischief. Come, thick night,</p>

<p>And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,</p>

<p>That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,</p>

<p>Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark</p>

<p>To cry “Hold, hold!”</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Macbeth.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor,</p>

<p>Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter!</p>

<p>Thy letters have transported me beyond</p>

<p>This ignorant present, and I feel now</p>

<p>The future in the instant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  My dearest love,</p>

<p>Duncan comes here tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  And when goes hence?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Tomorrow, as he purposes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  O, never</p>

<p>Shall sun that morrow see!</p>

<p>Your face, my thane, is as a book where men</p>

<p>May read strange matters. To beguile the time,</p>

<p>Look like the time. Bear welcome in your eye,</p>

<p>Your hand, your tongue. Look like th’ innocent</p>

<p>flower,</p>

<p>But be the serpent under ’t. He that’s coming</p>

<p>Must be provided for; and you shall put</p>

<p>This night’s great business into my dispatch,</p>

<p>Which shall to all our nights and days to come</p>

<p>Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>We will speak further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  Only look up clear.</p>

<p>To alter favor ever is to fear.</p>

<p>Leave all the rest to me.</p>
