<p><center><i>[Banquet prepared. Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth,</p>

<p>Ross, Lennox, Lords, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>You know your own degrees; sit down. At first</p>

<p>And last, the hearty welcome.     <i><i>[They sit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lords</sc>  Thanks to your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Ourself will mingle with society</p>

<p>And play the humble host.</p>

<p>Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time</p>

<p>We will require her welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,</p>

<p>For my heart speaks they are welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter First Murderer to the door.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>See, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks.</p>

<p>Both sides are even. Here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst.</p>

<p>Be large in mirth. Anon we’ll drink a measure</p>

<p>The table round. <i>[He approaches the Murderer.]</i> There’s</p>

<p>blood upon thy face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderer</sc>  ’Tis Banquo’s then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>’Tis better thee without than he within.</p>

<p>Is he dispatched?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderer</sc></p>

<p>My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Thou art the best o’ th’ cutthroats,</p>

<p>Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance.</p>

<p>If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderer</sc></p>

<p>Most royal sir, Fleance is ’scaped.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect,</p>

<p>Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,</p>

<p>As broad and general as the casing air.</p>

<p>But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in</p>

<p>To saucy doubts and fears.–But Banquo’s safe?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderer</sc></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,</p>

<p>With twenty trenched gashes on his head,</p>

<p>The least a death to nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  Thanks for that.</p>

<p>There the grown serpent lies. The worm that’s fled</p>

<p>Hath nature that in time will venom breed,</p>

<p>No teeth for th’ present. Get thee gone. Tomorrow</p>

<p>We’ll hear ourselves again.     <i><i>[Murderer exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  My royal lord,</p>

<p>You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold</p>

<p>That is not often vouched, while ’tis a-making,</p>

<p>’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;</p>

<p>From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony;</p>

<p>Meeting were bare without it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeth’s place.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc> <i>[to Lady Macbeth]</i>  Sweet remembrancer!–</p>

<p>Now, good digestion wait on appetite</p>

<p>And health on both!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lennox</sc>  May ’t please your Highness sit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Here had we now our country’s honor roofed,</p>

<p>Were the graced person of our Banquo present,</p>

<p>Who may I rather challenge for unkindness</p>

<p>Than pity for mischance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc>  His absence, sir,</p>

<p>Lays blame upon his promise. Please ’t your</p>

<p>Highness</p>

<p>To grace us with your royal company?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>The table’s full.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lennox</sc>  Here is a place reserved, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  Where?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lennox</sc></p>

<p>Here, my good lord. What is ’t that moves your</p>

<p>Highness?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Which of you have done this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lords</sc>  What, my good lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc> <i>[to the Ghost]</i></p>

<p>Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake</p>

<p>Thy gory locks at me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc></p>

<p>Gentlemen, rise. His Highness is not well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus</p>

<p>And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat.</p>

<p>The fit is momentary; upon a thought</p>

<p>He will again be well. If much you note him</p>

<p>You shall offend him and extend his passion.</p>

<p>Feed and regard him not.     <i><i>[Drawing Macbeth aside.]</i></i></p>

<p>Are you a man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that</p>

<p>Which might appall the devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  O, proper stuff!</p>

<p>This is the very painting of your fear.</p>

<p>This is the air-drawn dagger which you said</p>

<p>Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,</p>

<p>Impostors to true fear, would well become</p>

<p>A woman’s story at a winter’s fire,</p>

<p>Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!</p>

<p>Why do you make such faces? When all’s done,</p>

<p>You look but on a stool.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Prithee, see there. Behold, look! <i>[To the Ghost.]</i> Lo,</p>

<p>how say you?</p>

<p>Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.–</p>

<p>If charnel houses and our graves must send</p>

<p>Those that we bury back, our monuments</p>

<p>Shall be the maws of kites.     <i><i>[Ghost exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  What, quite unmanned in folly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>If I stand here, I saw him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  Fie, for shame!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Blood hath been shed ere now, i’ th’ olden time,</p>

<p>Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal;</p>

<p>Ay, and since too, murders have been performed</p>

<p>Too terrible for the ear. The time has been</p>

<p>That, when the brains were out, the man would die,</p>

<p>And there an end. But now they rise again</p>

<p>With twenty mortal murders on their crowns</p>

<p>And push us from our stools. This is more strange</p>

<p>Than such a murder is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  My worthy lord,</p>

<p>Your noble friends do lack you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  I do forget.–</p>

<p>Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.</p>

<p>I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing</p>

<p>To those that know me. Come, love and health to</p>

<p>all.</p>

<p>Then I’ll sit down.–Give me some wine. Fill full.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ghost.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>I drink to th’ general joy o’ th’ whole table</p>

<p>And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.</p>

<p>Would he were here! To all, and him we thirst,</p>

<p>And all to all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lords</sc>  Our duties, and the pledge.</p>

<p><center><i>[They raise their drinking cups.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc> <i>[to the Ghost]</i></p>

<p>Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee.</p>

<p>Thy bones are marrowless; thy blood is cold;</p>

<p>Thou hast no speculation in those eyes</p>

<p>Which thou dost glare with.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  Think of this, good</p>

<p>peers,</p>

<p>But as a thing of custom. ’Tis no other;</p>

<p>Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc> <i>[to the Ghost]</i>  What man dare, I dare.</p>

<p>Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,</p>

<p>The armed rhinoceros, or th’ Hyrcan tiger;</p>

<p>Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves</p>

<p>Shall never tremble. Or be alive again</p>

<p>And dare me to the desert with thy sword.</p>

<p>If trembling I inhabit then, protest me</p>

<p>The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!</p>

<p>Unreal mock’ry, hence!     <i><i>[Ghost exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Why so, being gone,</p>

<p>I am a man again.–Pray you sit still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>You have displaced the mirth, broke the good</p>

<p>meeting</p>

<p>With most admired disorder.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  Can such things be</p>

<p>And overcome us like a summer’s cloud,</p>

<p>Without our special wonder? You make me strange</p>

<p>Even to the disposition that I owe</p>

<p>When now I think you can behold such sights</p>

<p>And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks</p>

<p>When mine is blanched with fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc>  What sights, my</p>

<p>lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>I pray you, speak not. He grows worse and worse.</p>

<p>Question enrages him. At once, good night.</p>

<p>Stand not upon the order of your going,</p>

<p>But go at once.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lennox</sc>  Good night, and better health</p>

<p>Attend his Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  A kind good night to all.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lords and all but Macbeth and Lady Macbeth exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood.</p>

<p>Stones have been known to move, and trees to</p>

<p>speak.</p>

<p>Augurs and understood relations have</p>

<p>By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought</p>

<p>forth</p>

<p>The secret’st man of blood.–What is the night?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Almost at odds with morning, which is which.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>How say’st thou that Macduff denies his person</p>

<p>At our great bidding?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  Did you send to him, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>I hear it by the way; but I will send.</p>

<p>There’s not a one of them but in his house</p>

<p>I keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow</p>

<p>(And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters.</p>

<p>More shall they speak, for now I am bent to know</p>

<p>By the worst means the worst. For mine own good,</p>

<p>All causes shall give way. I am in blood</p>

<p>Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more,</p>

<p>Returning were as tedious as go o’er.</p>

<p>Strange things I have in head that will to hand,</p>

<p>Which must be acted ere they may be scanned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>You lack the season of all natures, sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Come, we’ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse</p>

<p>Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.</p>

<p>We are yet but young in deed.</p>
