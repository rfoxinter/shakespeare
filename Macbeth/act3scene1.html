<p><center><i>[Enter Banquo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc></p>

<p>Thou hast it now–king, Cawdor, Glamis, all</p>

<p>As the Weird Women promised, and I fear</p>

<p>Thou played’st most foully for ’t. Yet it was said</p>

<p>It should not stand in thy posterity,</p>

<p>But that myself should be the root and father</p>

<p>Of many kings. If there come truth from them</p>

<p>(As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)</p>

<p>Why, by the verities on thee made good,</p>

<p>May they not be my oracles as well,</p>

<p>And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady</p>

<p>Macbeth, Lennox, Ross, Lords, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Here’s our chief guest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  If he had been forgotten,</p>

<p>It had been as a gap in our great feast</p>

<p>And all-thing unbecoming.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,</p>

<p>And I’ll request your presence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc>  Let your Highness</p>

<p>Command upon me, to the which my duties</p>

<p>Are with a most indissoluble tie</p>

<p>Forever knit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  Ride you this afternoon?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc>  Ay, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>We should have else desired your good advice</p>

<p>(Which still hath been both grave and prosperous)</p>

<p>In this day’s council, but we’ll take tomorrow.</p>

<p>Is ’t far you ride?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc></p>

<p>As far, my lord, as will fill up the time</p>

<p>’Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,</p>

<p>I must become a borrower of the night</p>

<p>For a dark hour or twain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  Fail not our feast.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc>  My lord, I will not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>We hear our bloody cousins are bestowed</p>

<p>In England and in Ireland, not confessing</p>

<p>Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers</p>

<p>With strange invention. But of that tomorrow,</p>

<p>When therewithal we shall have cause of state</p>

<p>Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse. Adieu,</p>

<p>Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord. Our time does call upon ’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,</p>

<p>And so I do commend you to their backs.</p>

<p>Farewell.     <i><i>[Banquo exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Let every man be master of his time</p>

<p>Till seven at night. To make society</p>

<p>The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself</p>

<p>Till suppertime alone. While then, God be with you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lords and all but Macbeth and a Servant exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men</p>

<p>Our pleasure?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>They are, my lord, without the palace gate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Bring them before us.     <i><i>[Servant exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>To be thus is nothing,</p>

<p>But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo</p>

<p>Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature</p>

<p>Reigns that which would be feared. ’Tis much he</p>

<p>dares,</p>

<p>And to that dauntless temper of his mind</p>

<p>He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor</p>

<p>To act in safety. There is none but he</p>

<p>Whose being I do fear; and under him</p>

<p>My genius is rebuked, as it is said</p>

<p>Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters</p>

<p>When first they put the name of king upon me</p>

<p>And bade them speak to him. Then, prophet-like,</p>

<p>They hailed him father to a line of kings.</p>

<p>Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown</p>

<p>And put a barren scepter in my grip,</p>

<p>Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,</p>

<p>No son of mine succeeding. If ’t be so,</p>

<p>For Banquo’s issue have I filed my mind;</p>

<p>For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered,</p>

<p>Put rancors in the vessel of my peace</p>

<p>Only for them, and mine eternal jewel</p>

<p>Given to the common enemy of man</p>

<p>To make them kings, the seeds of Banquo kings.</p>

<p>Rather than so, come fate into the list,</p>

<p>And champion me to th’ utterance.–Who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servant and two Murderers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><i>[To the Servant.]</i> Now go to the door, and stay there</p>

<p>till we call.     <i><i>[Servant exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Was it not yesterday we spoke together?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderers</sc></p>

<p>It was, so please your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  Well then, now</p>

<p>Have you considered of my speeches? Know</p>

<p>That it was he, in the times past, which held you</p>

<p>So under fortune, which you thought had been</p>

<p>Our innocent self. This I made good to you</p>

<p>In our last conference, passed in probation with you</p>

<p>How you were borne in hand, how crossed, the</p>

<p>instruments,</p>

<p>Who wrought with them, and all things else that</p>

<p>might</p>

<p>To half a soul and to a notion crazed</p>

<p>Say “Thus did Banquo.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Murderer</sc>  You made it known to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>I did so, and went further, which is now</p>

<p>Our point of second meeting. Do you find</p>

<p>Your patience so predominant in your nature</p>

<p>That you can let this go? Are you so gospeled</p>

<p>To pray for this good man and for his issue,</p>

<p>Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave</p>

<p>And beggared yours forever?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Murderer</sc>  We are men, my liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Ay, in the catalogue you go for men,</p>

<p>As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels,</p>

<p>curs,</p>

<p>Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept</p>

<p>All by the name of dogs. The valued file</p>

<p>Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,</p>

<p>The housekeeper, the hunter, every one</p>

<p>According to the gift which bounteous nature</p>

<p>Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive</p>

<p>Particular addition, from the bill</p>

<p>That writes them all alike. And so of men.</p>

<p>Now, if you have a station in the file,</p>

<p>Not i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say ’t,</p>

<p>And I will put that business in your bosoms</p>

<p>Whose execution takes your enemy off,</p>

<p>Grapples you to the heart and love of us,</p>

<p>Who wear our health but sickly in his life,</p>

<p>Which in his death were perfect.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Murderer</sc>  I am one, my liege,</p>

<p>Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world</p>

<p>Hath so incensed that I am reckless what</p>

<p>I do to spite the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Murderer</sc>  And I another</p>

<p>So weary with disasters, tugged with fortune,</p>

<p>That I would set my life on any chance,</p>

<p>To mend it or be rid on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  Both of you</p>

<p>Know Banquo was your enemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderers</sc>  True, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>So is he mine, and in such bloody distance</p>

<p>That every minute of his being thrusts</p>

<p>Against my near’st of life. And though I could</p>

<p>With barefaced power sweep him from my sight</p>

<p>And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,</p>

<p>For certain friends that are both his and mine,</p>

<p>Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall</p>

<p>Who I myself struck down. And thence it is</p>

<p>That I to your assistance do make love,</p>

<p>Masking the business from the common eye</p>

<p>For sundry weighty reasons.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Murderer</sc>  We shall, my lord,</p>

<p>Perform what you command us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Murderer</sc>  Though our lives–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at</p>

<p>most</p>

<p>I will advise you where to plant yourselves,</p>

<p>Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time,</p>

<p>The moment on ’t, for ’t must be done tonight</p>

<p>And something from the palace; always thought</p>

<p>That I require a clearness. And with him</p>

<p>(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)</p>

<p>Fleance, his son, that keeps him company,</p>

<p>Whose absence is no less material to me</p>

<p>Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate</p>

<p>Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.</p>

<p>I’ll come to you anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderers</sc>  We are resolved, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>I’ll call upon you straight. Abide within.</p>

<p><center><i>[Murderers exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight,</p>

<p>If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
