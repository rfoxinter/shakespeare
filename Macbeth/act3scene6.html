<p><center><i>[Enter Lennox and another Lord.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lennox</span></p>

<p>My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,</p>

<p>Which can interpret farther. Only I say</p>

<p>Things have been strangely borne. The gracious</p>

<p>Duncan</p>

<p>Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.</p>

<p>And the right valiant Banquo walked too late,</p>

<p>Whom you may say, if ’t please you, Fleance killed,</p>

<p>For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.</p>

<p>Who cannot want the thought how monstrous</p>

<p>It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain</p>

<p>To kill their gracious father? Damned fact,</p>

<p>How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight</p>

<p>In pious rage the two delinquents tear</p>

<p>That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?</p>

<p>Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely, too,</p>

<p>For ’twould have angered any heart alive</p>

<p>To hear the men deny ’t. So that I say</p>

<p>He has borne all things well. And I do think</p>

<p>That had he Duncan’s sons under his key</p>

<p>(As, an ’t please heaven, he shall not) they should</p>

<p>find</p>

<p>What ’twere to kill a father. So should Fleance.</p>

<p>But peace. For from broad words, and ’cause he</p>

<p>failed</p>

<p>His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear</p>

<p>Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell</p>

<p>Where he bestows himself?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span>  The son of Duncan</p>

<p>(From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth)</p>

<p>Lives in the English court and is received</p>

<p>Of the most pious Edward with such grace</p>

<p>That the malevolence of fortune nothing</p>

<p>Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff</p>

<p>Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid</p>

<p>To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward</p>

<p>That, by the help of these (with Him above</p>

<p>To ratify the work), we may again</p>

<p>Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,</p>

<p>Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,</p>

<p>Do faithful homage, and receive free honors,</p>

<p>All which we pine for now. And this report</p>

<p>Hath so exasperate the King that he</p>

<p>Prepares for some attempt of war.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lennox</span>  Sent he to Macduff?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>He did, and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”</p>

<p>The cloudy messenger turns me his back</p>

<p>And hums, as who should say “You’ll rue the time</p>

<p>That clogs me with this answer.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lennox</span>  And that well might</p>

<p>Advise him to a caution t’ hold what distance</p>

<p>His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel</p>

<p>Fly to the court of England and unfold</p>

<p>His message ere he come, that a swift blessing</p>

<p>May soon return to this our suffering country</p>

<p>Under a hand accursed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span>  I’ll send my prayers with him.</p>
