<p><center><i>[Knocking within. Enter a Porter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  Here’s a knocking indeed! If a man were</p>

<p>porter of hell gate, he should have old turning the</p>

<p>key. <i>[(Knock.)]</i> Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there, i’</p>

<p>th’ name of Beelzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged</p>

<p>himself on th’ expectation of plenty. Come in time!</p>

<p>Have napkins enough about you; here you’ll sweat</p>

<p>for ’t. <i>[(Knock.)]</i> Knock, knock! Who’s there, in th’</p>

<p>other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator</p>

<p>that could swear in both the scales against either</p>

<p>scale, who committed treason enough for God’s</p>

<p>sake yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, come in,</p>

<p>equivocator. <i>[(Knock.)]</i> Knock, knock, knock! Who’s</p>

<p>there? Faith, here’s an English tailor come hither for</p>

<p>stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor. Here</p>

<p>you may roast your goose. <i>[(Knock.)]</i> Knock, knock!</p>

<p>Never at quiet.–What are you?–But this place is</p>

<p>too cold for hell. I’ll devil-porter it no further. I had</p>

<p>thought to have let in some of all professions that go</p>

<p>the primrose way to th’ everlasting bonfire. <i>[(Knock.)]</i></p>

<p>Anon, anon!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The Porter opens the door to Macduff and Lennox.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>I pray you, remember the porter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed</p>

<p>That you do lie so late?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second</p>

<p>cock, and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three</p>

<p>things.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  What three things does drink especially</p>

<p>provoke?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.</p>

<p>Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes. It provokes</p>

<p>the desire, but it takes away the performance.</p>

<p>Therefore much drink may be said to be an</p>

<p>equivocator with lechery. It makes him, and it</p>

<p>mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it</p>

<p>persuades him and disheartens him; makes him</p>

<p>stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates</p>

<p>him in a sleep and, giving him the lie, leaves</p>

<p>him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  That it did, sir, i’ th’ very throat on me; but I</p>

<p>requited him for his lie, and, I think, being too</p>

<p>strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime,</p>

<p>yet I made a shift to cast him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  Is thy master stirring?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Macbeth.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Our knocking has awaked him. Here he comes.</p>

<p><center><i>[Porter exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lennox</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, noble sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Good morrow, both.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>Is the King stirring, worthy thane?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Not yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>He did command me to call timely on him.</p>

<p>I have almost slipped the hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  I’ll bring you to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>I know this is a joyful trouble to you,</p>

<p>But yet ’tis one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>The labor we delight in physics pain.</p>

<p>This is the door.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  I’ll make so bold to call,</p>

<p>For ’tis my limited service.     <i><i>[Macduff exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lennox</span>  Goes the King hence today?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  He does. He did appoint so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lennox</span></p>

<p>The night has been unruly. Where we lay,</p>

<p>Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say,</p>

<p>Lamentings heard i’ th’ air, strange screams of</p>

<p>death,</p>

<p>And prophesying, with accents terrible,</p>

<p>Of dire combustion and confused events</p>

<p>New hatched to th’ woeful time. The obscure bird</p>

<p>Clamored the livelong night. Some say the Earth</p>

<p>Was feverous and did shake.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  ’Twas a rough night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lennox</span></p>

<p>My young remembrance cannot parallel</p>

<p>A fellow to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Macduff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  O horror, horror, horror!</p>

<p>Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span> <span class='sc'>And</span> <span class='sc'>Lennox</span>  What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.</p>

<p>Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope</p>

<p>The Lord’s anointed temple and stole thence</p>

<p>The life o’ th’ building.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  What is ’t you say? The life?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lennox</span>  Mean you his Majesty?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>Approach the chamber and destroy your sight</p>

<p>With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak.</p>

<p>See and then speak yourselves.</p>

<p><center><i>[Macbeth and Lennox exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Awake, awake!</p>

<p>Ring the alarum bell.–Murder and treason!</p>

<p>Banquo and Donalbain, Malcolm, awake!</p>

<p>Shake off this downy sleep, death’s counterfeit,</p>

<p>And look on death itself. Up, up, and see</p>

<p>The great doom’s image. Malcolm, Banquo,</p>

<p>As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites</p>

<p>To countenance this horror.–Ring the bell.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bell rings.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lady Macbeth.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  What’s the business,</p>

<p>That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley</p>

<p>The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  O gentle lady,</p>

<p>’Tis not for you to hear what I can speak.</p>

<p>The repetition in a woman’s ear</p>

<p>Would murder as it fell.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Banquo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O Banquo, Banquo,</p>

<p>Our royal master’s murdered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Woe, alas!</p>

<p>What, in our house?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span>  Too cruel anywhere.–</p>

<p>Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself</p>

<p>And say it is not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Macbeth, Lennox, and Ross.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Had I but died an hour before this chance,</p>

<p>I had lived a blessed time; for from this instant</p>

<p>There’s nothing serious in mortality.</p>

<p>All is but toys. Renown and grace is dead.</p>

<p>The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees</p>

<p>Is left this vault to brag of.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Donalbain</span>  What is amiss?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  You are, and do not know ’t.</p>

<p>The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood</p>

<p>Is stopped; the very source of it is stopped.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>Your royal father’s murdered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  O, by whom?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lennox</span></p>

<p>Those of his chamber, as it seemed, had done ’t.</p>

<p>Their hands and faces were all badged with blood.</p>

<p>So were their daggers, which unwiped we found</p>

<p>Upon their pillows. They stared and were distracted.</p>

<p>No man’s life was to be trusted with them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>O, yet I do repent me of my fury,</p>

<p>That I did kill them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  Wherefore did you so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Who can be wise, amazed, temp’rate, and furious,</p>

<p>Loyal, and neutral, in a moment? No man.</p>

<p>Th’ expedition of my violent love</p>

<p>Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,</p>

<p>His silver skin laced with his golden blood,</p>

<p>And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature</p>

<p>For ruin’s wasteful entrance; there the murderers,</p>

<p>Steeped in the colors of their trade, their daggers</p>

<p>Unmannerly breeched with gore. Who could refrain</p>

<p>That had a heart to love, and in that heart</p>

<p>Courage to make ’s love known?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Help me hence, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>Look to the lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span> <i>[aside to Donalbain]</i>  Why do we hold our</p>

<p>tongues,</p>

<p>That most may claim this argument for ours?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Donalbain</span> <i>[aside to Malcolm]</i></p>

<p>What should be spoken here, where our fate,</p>

<p>Hid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us?</p>

<p>Let’s away. Our tears are not yet brewed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span> <i>[aside to Donalbain]</i></p>

<p>Nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span>  Look to the lady.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lady Macbeth is assisted to leave.]</i></center></p>

<p>And when we have our naked frailties hid,</p>

<p>That suffer in exposure, let us meet</p>

<p>And question this most bloody piece of work</p>

<p>To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us.</p>

<p>In the great hand of God I stand, and thence</p>

<p>Against the undivulged pretense I fight</p>

<p>Of treasonous malice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  And so do I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  So all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Let’s briefly put on manly readiness</p>

<p>And meet i’ th’ hall together.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  Well contented.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Malcolm and Donalbain exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>What will you do? Let’s not consort with them.</p>

<p>To show an unfelt sorrow is an office</p>

<p>Which the false man does easy. I’ll to England.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Donalbain</span></p>

<p>To Ireland I. Our separated fortune</p>

<p>Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are,</p>

<p>There’s daggers in men’s smiles. The near in blood,</p>

<p>The nearer bloody.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  This murderous shaft that’s shot</p>

<p>Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way</p>

<p>Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse,</p>

<p>And let us not be dainty of leave-taking</p>

<p>But shift away. There’s warrant in that theft</p>

<p>Which steals itself when there’s no mercy left.</p>
