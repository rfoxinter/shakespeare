<p><center><i>[Alarum within. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm,</p>

<p>Donalbain, Lennox, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding</p>

<p>Captain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duncan</span></p>

<p>What bloody man is that? He can report,</p>

<p>As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt</p>

<p>The newest state.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  This is the sergeant</p>

<p>Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought</p>

<p>’Gainst my captivity.–Hail, brave friend!</p>

<p>Say to the King the knowledge of the broil</p>

<p>As thou didst leave it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Captain</span>  Doubtful it stood,</p>

<p>As two spent swimmers that do cling together</p>

<p>And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald</p>

<p>(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that</p>

<p>The multiplying villainies of nature</p>

<p>Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles</p>

<p>Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;</p>

<p>And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,</p>

<p>Showed like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak;</p>

<p>For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),</p>

<p>Disdaining Fortune, with his brandished steel,</p>

<p>Which smoked with bloody execution,</p>

<p>Like Valor’s minion, carved out his passage</p>

<p>Till he faced the slave;</p>

<p>Which ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,</p>

<p>Till he unseamed him from the nave to th’ chops,</p>

<p>And fixed his head upon our battlements.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duncan</span></p>

<p>O valiant cousin, worthy gentleman!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Captain</span></p>

<p>As whence the sun ’gins his reflection</p>

<p>Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,</p>

<p>So from that spring whence comfort seemed to</p>

<p>come</p>

<p>Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:</p>

<p>No sooner justice had, with valor armed,</p>

<p>Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels,</p>

<p>But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,</p>

<p>With furbished arms and new supplies of men,</p>

<p>Began a fresh assault.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duncan</span></p>

<p>Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and</p>

<p>Banquo?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Captain</span></p>

<p>Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.</p>

<p>If I say sooth, I must report they were</p>

<p>As cannons overcharged with double cracks,</p>

<p>So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.</p>

<p>Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds</p>

<p>Or memorize another Golgotha,</p>

<p>I cannot tell–</p>

<p>But I am faint. My gashes cry for help.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duncan</span></p>

<p>So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:</p>

<p>They smack of honor both.–Go, get him surgeons.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Captain is led off by Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ross and Angus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  The worthy Thane of Ross.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lennox</span></p>

<p>What a haste looks through his eyes!</p>

<p>So should he look that seems to speak things</p>

<p>strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span>  God save the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duncan</span>  Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span>  From Fife, great king,</p>

<p>Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky</p>

<p>And fan our people cold.</p>

<p>Norway himself, with terrible numbers,</p>

<p>Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,</p>

<p>The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,</p>

<p>Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapped in proof,</p>

<p>Confronted him with self-comparisons,</p>

<p>Point against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm,</p>

<p>Curbing his lavish spirit. And to conclude,</p>

<p>The victory fell on us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duncan</span>  Great happiness!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span>  That now Sweno,</p>

<p>The Norways’ king, craves composition.</p>

<p>Nor would we deign him burial of his men</p>

<p>Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch</p>

<p>Ten thousand dollars to our general use.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duncan</span></p>

<p>No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive</p>

<p>Our bosom interest. Go, pronounce his present</p>

<p>death,</p>

<p>And with his former title greet Macbeth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span>  I’ll see it done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duncan</span></p>

<p>What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.</p>
