<p><center><i>[Enter Macduff’s Wife, her Son, and Ross.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc></p>

<p>What had he done to make him fly the land?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc></p>

<p>You must have patience, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc>  He had none.</p>

<p>His flight was madness. When our actions do not,</p>

<p>Our fears do make us traitors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc>  You know not</p>

<p>Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc></p>

<p>Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,</p>

<p>His mansion and his titles in a place</p>

<p>From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;</p>

<p>He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,</p>

<p>The most diminutive of birds, will fight,</p>

<p>Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.</p>

<p>All is the fear, and nothing is the love,</p>

<p>As little is the wisdom, where the flight</p>

<p>So runs against all reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc>  My dearest coz,</p>

<p>I pray you school yourself. But for your husband,</p>

<p>He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows</p>

<p>The fits o’ th’ season. I dare not speak much</p>

<p>further;</p>

<p>But cruel are the times when we are traitors</p>

<p>And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor</p>

<p>From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,</p>

<p>But float upon a wild and violent sea</p>

<p>Each way and move–I take my leave of you.</p>

<p>Shall not be long but I’ll be here again.</p>

<p>Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward</p>

<p>To what they were before.–My pretty cousin,</p>

<p>Blessing upon you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc></p>

<p>Fathered he is, and yet he’s fatherless.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc></p>

<p>I am so much a fool, should I stay longer</p>

<p>It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.</p>

<p>I take my leave at once.     <i><i>[Ross exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc>  Sirrah, your father’s dead.</p>

<p>And what will you do now? How will you live?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc></p>

<p>As birds do, mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc>  What, with worms and flies?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc></p>

<p>With what I get, I mean; and so do they.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc></p>

<p>Poor bird, thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime,</p>

<p>The pitfall nor the gin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc></p>

<p>Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set</p>

<p>for.</p>

<p>My father is not dead, for all your saying.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc></p>

<p>Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for a father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc>  Nay, how will you do for a husband?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc></p>

<p>Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc>  Then you’ll buy ’em to sell again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc>  Thou speak’st with all thy wit,</p>

<p>And yet, i’ faith, with wit enough for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc>  Was my father a traitor, mother?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc>  Ay, that he was.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc>  What is a traitor?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc>  Why, one that swears and lies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc>  And be all traitors that do so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc>  Every one that does so is a traitor</p>

<p>and must be hanged.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc>  And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc>  Every one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc>  Who must hang them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc>  Why, the honest men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc>  Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there</p>

<p>are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest</p>

<p>men and hang up them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc>  Now God help thee, poor monkey! But</p>

<p>how wilt thou do for a father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc>  If he were dead, you’d weep for him. If you would</p>

<p>not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a</p>

<p>new father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc>  Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Bless you, fair dame. I am not to you known,</p>

<p>Though in your state of honor I am perfect.</p>

<p>I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.</p>

<p>If you will take a homely man’s advice,</p>

<p>Be not found here. Hence with your little ones!</p>

<p>To fright you thus methinks I am too savage;</p>

<p>To do worse to you were fell cruelty,</p>

<p>Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve</p>

<p>you!</p>

<p>I dare abide no longer.     <i><i>[Messenger exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc>  Whither should I fly?</p>

<p>I have done no harm. But I remember now</p>

<p>I am in this earthly world, where to do harm</p>

<p>Is often laudable, to do good sometime</p>

<p>Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,</p>

<p>Do I put up that womanly defense</p>

<p>To say I have done no harm?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Murderers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What are these faces?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderer</sc>  Where is your husband?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macduff</sc></p>

<p>I hope in no place so unsanctified</p>

<p>Where such as thou mayst find him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderer</sc>  He’s a traitor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc></p>

<p>Thou liest, thou shag-eared villain!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Murderer</sc>  What, you egg?</p>

<p><i>[Stabbing him.]</i> Young fry of treachery!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Son</sc>  He has killed</p>

<p>me, mother.</p>

<p>Run away, I pray you.</p>
