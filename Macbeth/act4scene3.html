<p><center><i>[Enter Malcolm and Macduff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>Let us seek out some desolate shade and there</p>

<p>Weep our sad bosoms empty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  Let us rather</p>

<p>Hold fast the mortal sword and, like good men,</p>

<p>Bestride our downfall’n birthdom. Each new morn</p>

<p>New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows</p>

<p>Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds</p>

<p>As if it felt with Scotland, and yelled out</p>

<p>Like syllable of dolor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  What I believe, I’ll wail;</p>

<p>What know, believe; and what I can redress,</p>

<p>As I shall find the time to friend, I will.</p>

<p>What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.</p>

<p>This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,</p>

<p>Was once thought honest. You have loved him well.</p>

<p>He hath not touched you yet. I am young, but</p>

<p>something</p>

<p>You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom</p>

<p>To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb</p>

<p>T’ appease an angry god.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>I am not treacherous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  But Macbeth is.</p>

<p>A good and virtuous nature may recoil</p>

<p>In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your</p>

<p>pardon.</p>

<p>That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.</p>

<p>Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.</p>

<p>Though all things foul would wear the brows of</p>

<p>grace,</p>

<p>Yet grace must still look so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  I have lost my hopes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.</p>

<p>Why in that rawness left you wife and child,</p>

<p>Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,</p>

<p>Without leave-taking? I pray you,</p>

<p>Let not my jealousies be your dishonors,</p>

<p>But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,</p>

<p>Whatever I shall think.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  Bleed, bleed, poor country!</p>

<p>Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,</p>

<p>For goodness dare not check thee. Wear thou thy</p>

<p>wrongs;</p>

<p>The title is affeered.–Fare thee well, lord.</p>

<p>I would not be the villain that thou think’st</p>

<p>For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp,</p>

<p>And the rich East to boot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  Be not offended.</p>

<p>I speak not as in absolute fear of you.</p>

<p>I think our country sinks beneath the yoke.</p>

<p>It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash</p>

<p>Is added to her wounds. I think withal</p>

<p>There would be hands uplifted in my right;</p>

<p>And here from gracious England have I offer</p>

<p>Of goodly thousands. But, for all this,</p>

<p>When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head</p>

<p>Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country</p>

<p>Shall have more vices than it had before,</p>

<p>More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,</p>

<p>By him that shall succeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  What should he be?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>It is myself I mean, in whom I know</p>

<p>All the particulars of vice so grafted</p>

<p>That, when they shall be opened, black Macbeth</p>

<p>Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state</p>

<p>Esteem him as a lamb, being compared</p>

<p>With my confineless harms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  Not in the legions</p>

<p>Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned</p>

<p>In evils to top Macbeth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  I grant him bloody,</p>

<p>Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,</p>

<p>Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin</p>

<p>That has a name. But there’s no bottom, none,</p>

<p>In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,</p>

<p>Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up</p>

<p>The cistern of my lust, and my desire</p>

<p>All continent impediments would o’erbear</p>

<p>That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth</p>

<p>Than such an one to reign.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  Boundless intemperance</p>

<p>In nature is a tyranny. It hath been</p>

<p>Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne</p>

<p>And fall of many kings. But fear not yet</p>

<p>To take upon you what is yours. You may</p>

<p>Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty</p>

<p>And yet seem cold–the time you may so hoodwink.</p>

<p>We have willing dames enough. There cannot be</p>

<p>That vulture in you to devour so many</p>

<p>As will to greatness dedicate themselves,</p>

<p>Finding it so inclined.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  With this there grows</p>

<p>In my most ill-composed affection such</p>

<p>A stanchless avarice that, were I king,</p>

<p>I should cut off the nobles for their lands,</p>

<p>Desire his jewels, and this other’s house;</p>

<p>And my more-having would be as a sauce</p>

<p>To make me hunger more, that I should forge</p>

<p>Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,</p>

<p>Destroying them for wealth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  This avarice</p>

<p>Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root</p>

<p>Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been</p>

<p>The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear.</p>

<p>Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will</p>

<p>Of your mere own. All these are portable,</p>

<p>With other graces weighed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>But I have none. The king-becoming graces,</p>

<p>As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,</p>

<p>Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,</p>

<p>Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,</p>

<p>I have no relish of them but abound</p>

<p>In the division of each several crime,</p>

<p>Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should</p>

<p>Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,</p>

<p>Uproar the universal peace, confound</p>

<p>All unity on earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  O Scotland, Scotland!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>If such a one be fit to govern, speak.</p>

<p>I am as I have spoken.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  Fit to govern?</p>

<p>No, not to live.–O nation miserable,</p>

<p>With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptered,</p>

<p>When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,</p>

<p>Since that the truest issue of thy throne</p>

<p>By his own interdiction stands accursed</p>

<p>And does blaspheme his breed?–Thy royal father</p>

<p>Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,</p>

<p>Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,</p>

<p>Died every day she lived. Fare thee well.</p>

<p>These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself</p>

<p>Hath banished me from Scotland.–O my breast,</p>

<p>Thy hope ends here!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  Macduff, this noble passion,</p>

<p>Child of integrity, hath from my soul</p>

<p>Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts</p>

<p>To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth</p>

<p>By many of these trains hath sought to win me</p>

<p>Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me</p>

<p>From overcredulous haste. But God above</p>

<p>Deal between thee and me, for even now</p>

<p>I put myself to thy direction and</p>

<p>Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure</p>

<p>The taints and blames I laid upon myself</p>

<p>For strangers to my nature. I am yet</p>

<p>Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,</p>

<p>Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,</p>

<p>At no time broke my faith, would not betray</p>

<p>The devil to his fellow, and delight</p>

<p>No less in truth than life. My first false speaking</p>

<p>Was this upon myself. What I am truly</p>

<p>Is thine and my poor country’s to command–</p>

<p>Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,</p>

<p>Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men,</p>

<p>Already at a point, was setting forth.</p>

<p>Now we’ll together, and the chance of goodness</p>

<p>Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>Such welcome and unwelcome things at once</p>

<p>’Tis hard to reconcile.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Doctor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  Well, more anon.–</p>

<p>Comes the King forth, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Doctor</span></p>

<p>Ay, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls</p>

<p>That stay his cure. Their malady convinces</p>

<p>The great assay of art, but at his touch</p>

<p>(Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand)</p>

<p>They presently amend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  I thank you, doctor.</p>

<p><center><i>[Doctor exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>What’s the disease he means?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  ’Tis called the evil:</p>

<p>A most miraculous work in this good king,</p>

<p>Which often since my here-remain in England</p>

<p>I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven</p>

<p>Himself best knows, but strangely visited people</p>

<p>All swoll’n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,</p>

<p>The mere despair of surgery, he cures,</p>

<p>Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,</p>

<p>Put on with holy prayers; and, ’tis spoken,</p>

<p>To the succeeding royalty he leaves</p>

<p>The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,</p>

<p>He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,</p>

<p>And sundry blessings hang about his throne</p>

<p>That speak him full of grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ross.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  See who comes here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>My countryman, but yet I know him not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>I know him now.–Good God betimes remove</p>

<p>The means that makes us strangers!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span>  Sir, amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>Stands Scotland where it did?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span>  Alas, poor country,</p>

<p>Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot</p>

<p>Be called our mother, but our grave, where nothing</p>

<p>But who knows nothing is once seen to smile;</p>

<p>Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air</p>

<p>Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems</p>

<p>A modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell</p>

<p>Is there scarce asked for who, and good men’s lives</p>

<p>Expire before the flowers in their caps,</p>

<p>Dying or ere they sicken.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>O relation too nice and yet too true!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  What’s the newest grief?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span></p>

<p>That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker.</p>

<p>Each minute teems a new one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  How does my wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span>  Why, well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  And all my children?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span>  Well too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>The tyrant has not battered at their peace?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span></p>

<p>No, they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>Be not a niggard of your speech. How goes ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span></p>

<p>When I came hither to transport the tidings</p>

<p>Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor</p>

<p>Of many worthy fellows that were out;</p>

<p>Which was to my belief witnessed the rather</p>

<p>For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.</p>

<p>Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland</p>

<p>Would create soldiers, make our women fight</p>

<p>To doff their dire distresses.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  Be ’t their comfort</p>

<p>We are coming thither. Gracious England hath</p>

<p>Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;</p>

<p>An older and a better soldier none</p>

<p>That Christendom gives out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span>  Would I could answer</p>

<p>This comfort with the like. But I have words</p>

<p>That would be howled out in the desert air,</p>

<p>Where hearing should not latch them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  What concern</p>

<p>they–</p>

<p>The general cause, or is it a fee-grief</p>

<p>Due to some single breast?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span>  No mind that’s honest</p>

<p>But in it shares some woe, though the main part</p>

<p>Pertains to you alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  If it be mine,</p>

<p>Keep it not from me. Quickly let me have it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span></p>

<p>Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,</p>

<p>Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound</p>

<p>That ever yet they heard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  Hum! I guess at it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span></p>

<p>Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes</p>

<p>Savagely slaughtered. To relate the manner</p>

<p>Were on the quarry of these murdered deer</p>

<p>To add the death of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  Merciful heaven!–</p>

<p>What, man, ne’er pull your hat upon your brows.</p>

<p>Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak</p>

<p>Whispers the o’erfraught heart and bids it break.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  My children too?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span></p>

<p>Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>And I must be from thence? My wife killed too?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span>  I have said.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  Be comforted.</p>

<p>Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge</p>

<p>To cure this deadly grief.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>He has no children. All my pretty ones?</p>

<p>Did you say “all”? O hell-kite! All?</p>

<p>What, all my pretty chickens and their dam</p>

<p>At one fell swoop?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  Dispute it like a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  I shall do so,</p>

<p>But I must also feel it as a man.</p>

<p>I cannot but remember such things were</p>

<p>That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on</p>

<p>And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,</p>

<p>They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,</p>

<p>Not for their own demerits, but for mine,</p>

<p>Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief</p>

<p>Convert to anger. Blunt not the heart; enrage it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>O, I could play the woman with mine eyes</p>

<p>And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,</p>

<p>Cut short all intermission! Front to front</p>

<p>Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.</p>

<p>Within my sword’s length set him. If he ’scape,</p>

<p>Heaven forgive him too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span>  This tune goes manly.</p>

<p>Come, go we to the King. Our power is ready;</p>

<p>Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth</p>

<p>Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above</p>

<p>Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you</p>

<p>may.</p>

<p>The night is long that never finds the day.</p>
