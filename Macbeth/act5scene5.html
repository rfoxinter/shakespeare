<p><center><i>[Enter Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers, with Drum and</p>

<p>Colors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Hang out our banners on the outward walls.</p>

<p>The cry is still “They come!” Our castle’s strength</p>

<p>Will laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lie</p>

<p>Till famine and the ague eat them up.</p>

<p>Were they not forced with those that should be</p>

<p>ours,</p>

<p>We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,</p>

<p>And beat them backward home.</p>

<p><center><i>[A cry within of women.]</i></center></p>

<p>What is that noise?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Seyton</span></p>

<p>It is the cry of women, my good lord.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>I have almost forgot the taste of fears.</p>

<p>The time has been my senses would have cooled</p>

<p>To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair</p>

<p>Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir</p>

<p>As life were in ’t. I have supped full with horrors.</p>

<p>Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,</p>

<p>Cannot once start me.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Seyton.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Wherefore was that cry?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Seyton</span>  The Queen, my lord, is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  She should have died hereafter.</p>

<p>There would have been a time for such a word.</p>

<p>Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow</p>

<p>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day</p>

<p>To the last syllable of recorded time,</p>

<p>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</p>

<p>The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!</p>

<p>Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player</p>

<p>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage</p>

<p>And then is heard no more. It is a tale</p>

<p>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,</p>

<p>Signifying nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Thou com’st to use thy tongue: thy story quickly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Gracious my lord,</p>

<p>I should report that which I say I saw,</p>

<p>But know not how to do ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Well, say, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>As I did stand my watch upon the hill,</p>

<p>I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought</p>

<p>The Wood began to move.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Liar and slave!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Let me endure your wrath if ’t be not so.</p>

<p>Within this three mile may you see it coming.</p>

<p>I say, a moving grove.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  If thou speak’st false,</p>

<p>Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive</p>

<p>Till famine cling thee. If thy speech be sooth,</p>

<p>I care not if thou dost for me as much.–</p>

<p>I pull in resolution and begin</p>

<p>To doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend,</p>

<p>That lies like truth. “Fear not till Birnam Wood</p>

<p>Do come to Dunsinane,” and now a wood</p>

<p>Comes toward Dunsinane.–Arm, arm, and out!–</p>

<p>If this which he avouches does appear,</p>

<p>There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.</p>

<p>I ’gin to be aweary of the sun</p>

<p>And wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now</p>

<p>undone.–</p>

<p>Ring the alarum bell!–Blow wind, come wrack,</p>

<p>At least we’ll die with harness on our back.</p>
