<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King Duncan, Lennox, Malcolm,</p>

<p>Donalbain, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duncan</sc></p>

<p>Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not</p>

<p>Those in commission yet returned?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Malcolm</sc>  My liege,</p>

<p>They are not yet come back. But I have spoke</p>

<p>With one that saw him die, who did report</p>

<p>That very frankly he confessed his treasons,</p>

<p>Implored your Highness’ pardon, and set forth</p>

<p>A deep repentance. Nothing in his life</p>

<p>Became him like the leaving it. He died</p>

<p>As one that had been studied in his death</p>

<p>To throw away the dearest thing he owed</p>

<p>As ’twere a careless trifle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duncan</sc>  There’s no art</p>

<p>To find the mind’s construction in the face.</p>

<p>He was a gentleman on whom I built</p>

<p>An absolute trust.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O worthiest cousin,</p>

<p>The sin of my ingratitude even now</p>

<p>Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before</p>

<p>That swiftest wing of recompense is slow</p>

<p>To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,</p>

<p>That the proportion both of thanks and payment</p>

<p>Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,</p>

<p>More is thy due than more than all can pay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>The service and the loyalty I owe</p>

<p>In doing it pays itself. Your Highness’ part</p>

<p>Is to receive our duties, and our duties</p>

<p>Are to your throne and state children and servants,</p>

<p>Which do but what they should by doing everything</p>

<p>Safe toward your love and honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duncan</sc>  Welcome hither.</p>

<p>I have begun to plant thee and will labor</p>

<p>To make thee full of growing.–Noble Banquo,</p>

<p>That hast no less deserved nor must be known</p>

<p>No less to have done so, let me enfold thee</p>

<p>And hold thee to my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc>  There, if I grow,</p>

<p>The harvest is your own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duncan</sc>  My plenteous joys,</p>

<p>Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves</p>

<p>In drops of sorrow.–Sons, kinsmen, thanes,</p>

<p>And you whose places are the nearest, know</p>

<p>We will establish our estate upon</p>

<p>Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter</p>

<p>The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must</p>

<p>Not unaccompanied invest him only,</p>

<p>But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine</p>

<p>On all deservers.–From hence to Inverness</p>

<p>And bind us further to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>The rest is labor which is not used for you.</p>

<p>I’ll be myself the harbinger and make joyful</p>

<p>The hearing of my wife with your approach.</p>

<p>So humbly take my leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duncan</sc>  My worthy Cawdor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step</p>

<p>On which I must fall down or else o’erleap,</p>

<p>For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;</p>

<p>Let not light see my black and deep desires.</p>

<p>The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be</p>

<p>Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duncan</sc></p>

<p>True, worthy Banquo. He is full so valiant,</p>

<p>And in his commendations I am fed:</p>

<p>It is a banquet to me.–Let’s after him,</p>

<p>Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome.</p>

<p>It is a peerless kinsman.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. They exit.]</i></center></p>
