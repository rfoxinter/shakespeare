<p><center><i>[Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch before him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc>  How goes the night, boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fleance</sc></p>

<p>The moon is down. I have not heard the clock.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc>  And she goes down at twelve.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fleance</sc>  I take ’t ’tis later, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc></p>

<p>Hold, take my sword.     <i><i>[He gives his sword to Fleance.]</i></i></p>

<p>There’s husbandry in heaven;</p>

<p>Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.</p>

<p>A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,</p>

<p>And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,</p>

<p>Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature</p>

<p>Gives way to in repose.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Macbeth, and a Servant with a torch.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Give me my sword.–Who’s</p>

<p>there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  A friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc></p>

<p>What, sir, not yet at rest? The King’s abed.</p>

<p>He hath been in unusual pleasure, and</p>

<p>Sent forth great largess to your offices.</p>

<p>This diamond he greets your wife withal,</p>

<p>By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up</p>

<p>In measureless content.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives Macbeth a jewel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  Being unprepared,</p>

<p>Our will became the servant to defect,</p>

<p>Which else should free have wrought.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc>  All’s well.</p>

<p>I dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters.</p>

<p>To you they have showed some truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  I think not of</p>

<p>them.</p>

<p>Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,</p>

<p>We would spend it in some words upon that</p>

<p>business,</p>

<p>If you would grant the time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc>  At your kind’st leisure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis,</p>

<p>It shall make honor for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc>  So I lose none</p>

<p>In seeking to augment it, but still keep</p>

<p>My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,</p>

<p>I shall be counseled.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc>  Good repose the while.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Banquo</sc>  Thanks, sir. The like to you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Banquo and Fleance exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macbeth</sc></p>

<p>Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,</p>

<p>She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.</p>

<p><center><i>[Servant exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Is this a dagger which I see before me,</p>

<p>The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<p>I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.</p>

<p>Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible</p>

<p>To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but</p>

<p>A dagger of the mind, a false creation</p>

<p>Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?</p>

<p>I see thee yet, in form as palpable</p>

<p>As this which now I draw.     <i><i>[He draws his dagger.]</i></i></p>

<p>Thou marshal’st me the way that I was going,</p>

<p>And such an instrument I was to use.</p>

<p>Mine eyes are made the fools o’ th’ other senses</p>

<p>Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still,</p>

<p>And, on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,</p>

<p>Which was not so before. There’s no such thing.</p>

<p>It is the bloody business which informs</p>

<p>Thus to mine eyes. Now o’er the one-half world</p>

<p>Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse</p>

<p>The curtained sleep. Witchcraft celebrates</p>

<p>Pale Hecate’s off’rings, and withered murder,</p>

<p>Alarumed by his sentinel, the wolf,</p>

<p>Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,</p>

<p>With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his</p>

<p>design</p>

<p>Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,</p>

<p>Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear</p>

<p>Thy very stones prate of my whereabouts</p>

<p>And take the present horror from the time,</p>

<p>Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives.</p>

<p>Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.</p>

<p><center><i>[A bell rings.]</i></center></p>

<p>I go, and it is done. The bell invites me.</p>

<p>Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell</p>

<p>That summons thee to heaven or to hell.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
