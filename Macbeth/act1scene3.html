<p><center><i>[Thunder. Enter the three Witches.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span>  Where hast thou been, sister?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span>  Killing swine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span>  Sister, where thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap</p>

<p>And munched and munched and munched. “Give</p>

<p>me,” quoth I.</p>

<p>“Aroint thee, witch,” the rump-fed runnion cries.</p>

<p>Her husband’s to Aleppo gone, master o’ th’ Tiger;</p>

<p>But in a sieve I’ll thither sail,</p>

<p>And, like a rat without a tail,</p>

<p>I’ll do, I’ll do, and I’ll do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>I’ll give thee a wind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>Th’ art kind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>And I another.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>I myself have all the other,</p>

<p>And the very ports they blow;</p>

<p>All the quarters that they know</p>

<p>I’ th’ shipman’s card.</p>

<p>I’ll drain him dry as hay.</p>

<p>Sleep shall neither night nor day</p>

<p>Hang upon his penthouse lid.</p>

<p>He shall live a man forbid.</p>

<p>Weary sev’nnights, nine times nine,</p>

<p>Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine.</p>

<p>Though his bark cannot be lost,</p>

<p>Yet it shall be tempest-tossed.</p>

<p>Look what I have.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span>  Show me, show me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>Here I have a pilot’s thumb,</p>

<p>Wracked as homeward he did come.     <i><i>[Drum within.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>A drum, a drum!</p>

<p>Macbeth doth come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <i>[dancing in a circle]</i></p>

<p>The Weird Sisters, hand in hand,</p>

<p>Posters of the sea and land,</p>

<p>Thus do go about, about,</p>

<p>Thrice to thine and thrice to mine</p>

<p>And thrice again, to make up nine.</p>

<p>Peace, the charm’s wound up.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Macbeth and Banquo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>So foul and fair a day I have not seen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span></p>

<p>How far is ’t called to Forres?–What are these,</p>

<p>So withered, and so wild in their attire,</p>

<p>That look not like th’ inhabitants o’ th’ Earth</p>

<p>And yet are on ’t?–Live you? Or are you aught</p>

<p>That man may question? You seem to understand</p>

<p>me</p>

<p>By each at once her choppy finger laying</p>

<p>Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,</p>

<p>And yet your beards forbid me to interpret</p>

<p>That you are so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Speak if you can. What are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span></p>

<p>Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear</p>

<p>Things that do sound so fair?–I’ th’ name of truth,</p>

<p>Are you fantastical, or that indeed</p>

<p>Which outwardly you show? My noble partner</p>

<p>You greet with present grace and great prediction</p>

<p>Of noble having and of royal hope,</p>

<p>That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.</p>

<p>If you can look into the seeds of time</p>

<p>And say which grain will grow and which will not,</p>

<p>Speak, then, to me, who neither beg nor fear</p>

<p>Your favors nor your hate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span>  Hail!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span>  Hail!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span>  Hail!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>Lesser than Macbeth and greater.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>Not so happy, yet much happier.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.</p>

<p>So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Witch</span></p>

<p>Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Stay, you imperfect speakers. Tell me more.</p>

<p>By Sinel’s death I know I am Thane of Glamis.</p>

<p>But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives</p>

<p>A prosperous gentleman, and to be king</p>

<p>Stands not within the prospect of belief,</p>

<p>No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence</p>

<p>You owe this strange intelligence or why</p>

<p>Upon this blasted heath you stop our way</p>

<p>With such prophetic greeting. Speak, I charge you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Witches vanish.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span></p>

<p>The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,</p>

<p>And these are of them. Whither are they vanished?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Into the air, and what seemed corporal melted,</p>

<p>As breath into the wind. Would they had stayed!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span></p>

<p>Were such things here as we do speak about?</p>

<p>Or have we eaten on the insane root</p>

<p>That takes the reason prisoner?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Your children shall be kings.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span>  You shall be king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span></p>

<p>To th’ selfsame tune and words.–Who’s here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ross and Angus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span></p>

<p>The King hath happily received, Macbeth,</p>

<p>The news of thy success, and, when he reads</p>

<p>Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight,</p>

<p>His wonders and his praises do contend</p>

<p>Which should be thine or his. Silenced with that,</p>

<p>In viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day</p>

<p>He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,</p>

<p>Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,</p>

<p>Strange images of death. As thick as tale</p>

<p>Came post with post, and every one did bear</p>

<p>Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense,</p>

<p>And poured them down before him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angus</span>  We are sent</p>

<p>To give thee from our royal master thanks,</p>

<p>Only to herald thee into his sight,</p>

<p>Not pay thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span></p>

<p>And for an earnest of a greater honor,</p>

<p>He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor,</p>

<p>In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,</p>

<p>For it is thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span>  What, can the devil speak true?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me</p>

<p>In borrowed robes?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angus</span>  Who was the Thane lives yet,</p>

<p>But under heavy judgment bears that life</p>

<p>Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was</p>

<p>combined</p>

<p>With those of Norway, or did line the rebel</p>

<p>With hidden help and vantage, or that with both</p>

<p>He labored in his country’s wrack, I know not;</p>

<p>But treasons capital, confessed and proved,</p>

<p>Have overthrown him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Glamis and Thane of Cawdor!</p>

<p>The greatest is behind. <i>[To Ross and Angus.]</i> Thanks</p>

<p>for your pains.</p>

<p><i>[Aside to Banquo.]</i> Do you not hope your children</p>

<p>shall be kings,</p>

<p>When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me</p>

<p>Promised no less to them?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span>  That, trusted home,</p>

<p>Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,</p>

<p>Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange.</p>

<p>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,</p>

<p>The instruments of darkness tell us truths,</p>

<p>Win us with honest trifles, to betray ’s</p>

<p>In deepest consequence.–</p>

<p>Cousins, a word, I pray you.     <i><i>[They step aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Two truths are told</p>

<p>As happy prologues to the swelling act</p>

<p>Of the imperial theme.–I thank you, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> This supernatural soliciting</p>

<p>Cannot be ill, cannot be good. If ill,</p>

<p>Why hath it given me earnest of success</p>

<p>Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.</p>

<p>If good, why do I yield to that suggestion</p>

<p>Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair</p>

<p>And make my seated heart knock at my ribs</p>

<p>Against the use of nature? Present fears</p>

<p>Are less than horrible imaginings.</p>

<p>My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,</p>

<p>Shakes so my single state of man</p>

<p>That function is smothered in surmise,</p>

<p>And nothing is but what is not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span>  Look how our partner’s rapt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>If chance will have me king, why, chance may</p>

<p>crown me</p>

<p>Without my stir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span>  New honors come upon him,</p>

<p>Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mold</p>

<p>But with the aid of use.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Come what come may,</p>

<p>Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span></p>

<p>Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Give me your favor. My dull brain was wrought</p>

<p>With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains</p>

<p>Are registered where every day I turn</p>

<p>The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King.</p>

<p><i>[Aside to Banquo.]</i> Think upon what hath chanced,</p>

<p>and at more time,</p>

<p>The interim having weighed it, let us speak</p>

<p>Our free hearts each to other.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Banquo</span>  Very gladly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Till then, enough.–Come, friends.</p>
