<p><center><i>[Enter Macbeth.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Why should I play the Roman fool and die</p>

<p>On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes</p>

<p>Do better upon them.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Macduff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  Turn, hellhound, turn!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Of all men else I have avoided thee.</p>

<p>But get thee back. My soul is too much charged</p>

<p>With blood of thine already.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  I have no words;</p>

<p>My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain</p>

<p>Than terms can give thee out.     <i><i>[Fight. Alarum.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Thou losest labor.</p>

<p>As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air</p>

<p>With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.</p>

<p>Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;</p>

<p>I bear a charmed life, which must not yield</p>

<p>To one of woman born.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  Despair thy charm,</p>

<p>And let the angel whom thou still hast served</p>

<p>Tell thee Macduff was from his mother’s womb</p>

<p>Untimely ripped.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,</p>

<p>For it hath cowed my better part of man!</p>

<p>And be these juggling fiends no more believed</p>

<p>That palter with us in a double sense,</p>

<p>That keep the word of promise to our ear</p>

<p>And break it to our hope. I’ll not fight with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span>  Then yield thee, coward,</p>

<p>And live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time.</p>

<p>We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,</p>

<p>Painted upon a pole, and underwrit</p>

<p>“Here may you see the tyrant.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  I will not yield</p>

<p>To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet</p>

<p>And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.</p>

<p>Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane</p>

<p>And thou opposed, being of no woman born,</p>

<p>Yet I will try the last. Before my body</p>

<p>I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,</p>

<p>And damned be him that first cries “Hold! Enough!”</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit fighting. Alarums.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[They enter fighting, and Macbeth is slain. Macduff</p>

<p>exits carrying off Macbeth’s body. Retreat and flourish.</p>

<p>Enter, with Drum and Colors, Malcolm, Siward, Ross,</p>

<p>Thanes, and Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Siward</span></p>

<p>Some must go off; and yet by these I see</p>

<p>So great a day as this is cheaply bought.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>Macduff is missing, and your noble son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span></p>

<p>Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt.</p>

<p>He only lived but till he was a man,</p>

<p>The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed</p>

<p>In the unshrinking station where he fought,</p>

<p>But like a man he died.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Siward</span>  Then he is dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span></p>

<p>Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow</p>

<p>Must not be measured by his worth, for then</p>

<p>It hath no end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Siward</span>  Had he his hurts before?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span></p>

<p>Ay, on the front.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Siward</span>  Why then, God’s soldier be he!</p>

<p>Had I as many sons as I have hairs,</p>

<p>I would not wish them to a fairer death;</p>

<p>And so his knell is knolled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>He’s worth more sorrow, and that I’ll spend for</p>

<p>him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Siward</span>  He’s worth no more.</p>

<p>They say he parted well and paid his score,</p>

<p>And so, God be with him. Here comes newer</p>

<p>comfort.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Macduff with Macbeth’s head.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macduff</span></p>

<p>Hail, King! for so thou art. Behold where stands</p>

<p>Th’ usurper’s cursed head. The time is free.</p>

<p>I see thee compassed with thy kingdom’s pearl,</p>

<p>That speak my salutation in their minds,</p>

<p>Whose voices I desire aloud with mine.</p>

<p>Hail, King of Scotland!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  Hail, King of Scotland!     <i><i>[Flourish.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Malcolm</span></p>

<p>We shall not spend a large expense of time</p>

<p>Before we reckon with your several loves</p>

<p>And make us even with you. My thanes and</p>

<p>kinsmen,</p>

<p>Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland</p>

<p>In such an honor named. What’s more to do,</p>

<p>Which would be planted newly with the time,</p>

<p>As calling home our exiled friends abroad</p>

<p>That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,</p>

<p>Producing forth the cruel ministers</p>

<p>Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen</p>

<p>(Who, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands,</p>

<p>Took off her life)–this, and what needful else</p>

<p>That calls upon us, by the grace of grace,</p>

<p>We will perform in measure, time, and place.</p>

<p>So thanks to all at once and to each one,</p>

<p>Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. All exit.]</i></center></p>
