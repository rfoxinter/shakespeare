<p><center><i>[Hautboys. Torches. Enter a Sewer and divers Servants</p>

<p>with dishes and service over the stage. Then enter</p>

<p>Macbeth.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well</p>

<p>It were done quickly. If th’ assassination</p>

<p>Could trammel up the consequence and catch</p>

<p>With his surcease success, that but this blow</p>

<p>Might be the be-all and the end-all here,</p>

<p>But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,</p>

<p>We’d jump the life to come. But in these cases</p>

<p>We still have judgment here, that we but teach</p>

<p>Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return</p>

<p>To plague th’ inventor. This even-handed justice</p>

<p>Commends th’ ingredience of our poisoned chalice</p>

<p>To our own lips. He’s here in double trust:</p>

<p>First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,</p>

<p>Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,</p>

<p>Who should against his murderer shut the door,</p>

<p>Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan</p>

<p>Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been</p>

<p>So clear in his great office, that his virtues</p>

<p>Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against</p>

<p>The deep damnation of his taking-off;</p>

<p>And pity, like a naked newborn babe</p>

<p>Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubin horsed</p>

<p>Upon the sightless couriers of the air,</p>

<p>Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,</p>

<p>That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur</p>

<p>To prick the sides of my intent, but only</p>

<p>Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself</p>

<p>And falls on th’ other–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lady Macbeth.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>He has almost supped. Why have you left the</p>

<p>chamber?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Hath he asked for me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Know you not he has?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>We will proceed no further in this business.</p>

<p>He hath honored me of late, and I have bought</p>

<p>Golden opinions from all sorts of people,</p>

<p>Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,</p>

<p>Not cast aside so soon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Was the hope drunk</p>

<p>Wherein you dressed yourself? Hath it slept since?</p>

<p>And wakes it now, to look so green and pale</p>

<p>At what it did so freely? From this time</p>

<p>Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard</p>

<p>To be the same in thine own act and valor</p>

<p>As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that</p>

<p>Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life</p>

<p>And live a coward in thine own esteem,</p>

<p>Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would,”</p>

<p>Like the poor cat i’ th’ adage?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Prithee, peace.</p>

<p>I dare do all that may become a man.</p>

<p>Who dares do more is none.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  What beast was ’t,</p>

<p>then,</p>

<p>That made you break this enterprise to me?</p>

<p>When you durst do it, then you were a man;</p>

<p>And to be more than what you were, you would</p>

<p>Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place</p>

<p>Did then adhere, and yet you would make both.</p>

<p>They have made themselves, and that their fitness</p>

<p>now</p>

<p>Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know</p>

<p>How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me.</p>

<p>I would, while it was smiling in my face,</p>

<p>Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums</p>

<p>And dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you</p>

<p>Have done to this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  If we should fail–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  We fail?</p>

<p>But screw your courage to the sticking place</p>

<p>And we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep</p>

<p>(Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey</p>

<p>Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains</p>

<p>Will I with wine and wassail so convince</p>

<p>That memory, the warder of the brain,</p>

<p>Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason</p>

<p>A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep</p>

<p>Their drenched natures lies as in a death,</p>

<p>What cannot you and I perform upon</p>

<p>Th’ unguarded Duncan? What not put upon</p>

<p>His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt</p>

<p>Of our great quell?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Bring forth men-children only,</p>

<p>For thy undaunted mettle should compose</p>

<p>Nothing but males. Will it not be received,</p>

<p>When we have marked with blood those sleepy two</p>

<p>Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,</p>

<p>That they have done ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Who dares receive it other,</p>

<p>As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar</p>

<p>Upon his death?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  I am settled and bend up</p>

<p>Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.</p>

<p>Away, and mock the time with fairest show.</p>

<p>False face must hide what the false heart doth</p>

<p>know.</p>
