<p><center><i>[Enter Macbeth’s Lady and a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Is Banquo gone from court?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span></p>

<p>Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Say to the King I would attend his leisure</p>

<p>For a few words.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span>  Madam, I will.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Naught’s had, all’s spent,</p>

<p>Where our desire is got without content.</p>

<p>’Tis safer to be that which we destroy</p>

<p>Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Macbeth.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, my lord, why do you keep alone,</p>

<p>Of sorriest fancies your companions making,</p>

<p>Using those thoughts which should indeed have died</p>

<p>With them they think on? Things without all remedy</p>

<p>Should be without regard. What’s done is done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>We have scorched the snake, not killed it.</p>

<p>She’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice</p>

<p>Remains in danger of her former tooth.</p>

<p>But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds</p>

<p>suffer,</p>

<p>Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep</p>

<p>In the affliction of these terrible dreams</p>

<p>That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,</p>

<p>Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,</p>

<p>Than on the torture of the mind to lie</p>

<p>In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave.</p>

<p>After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well.</p>

<p>Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison,</p>

<p>Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing</p>

<p>Can touch him further.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  Come on, gentle my lord,</p>

<p>Sleek o’er your rugged looks. Be bright and jovial</p>

<p>Among your guests tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  So shall I, love,</p>

<p>And so I pray be you. Let your remembrance</p>

<p>Apply to Banquo; present him eminence</p>

<p>Both with eye and tongue: unsafe the while that we</p>

<p>Must lave our honors in these flattering streams</p>

<p>And make our faces vizards to our hearts,</p>

<p>Disguising what they are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  You must leave this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!</p>

<p>Thou know’st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>There’s comfort yet; they are assailable.</p>

<p>Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown</p>

<p>His cloistered flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons</p>

<p>The shard-born beetle with his drowsy hums</p>

<p>Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done</p>

<p>A deed of dreadful note.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>  What’s to be done?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span></p>

<p>Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,</p>

<p>Till thou applaud the deed.–Come, seeling night,</p>

<p>Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day</p>

<p>And with thy bloody and invisible hand</p>

<p>Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond</p>

<p>Which keeps me pale. Light thickens, and the crow</p>

<p>Makes wing to th’ rooky wood.</p>

<p>Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,</p>

<p>Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do</p>

<p>rouse.–</p>

<p>Thou marvel’st at my words, but hold thee still.</p>

<p>Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.</p>

<p>So prithee go with me.</p>
