<p><center><i>[Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  I have two nights watched with you but can</p>

<p>perceive no truth in your report. When was it she</p>

<p>last walked?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentlewoman</sc>  Since his Majesty went into the field, I</p>

<p>have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown</p>

<p>upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,</p>

<p>fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and</p>

<p>again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast</p>

<p>sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  A great perturbation in nature, to receive at</p>

<p>once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of</p>

<p>watching. In this slumb’ry agitation, besides her</p>

<p>walking and other actual performances, what at any</p>

<p>time have you heard her say?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentlewoman</sc>  That, sir, which I will not report after</p>

<p>her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  You may to me, and ’tis most meet you</p>

<p>should.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentlewoman</sc>  Neither to you nor anyone, having no</p>

<p>witness to confirm my speech.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise and,</p>

<p>upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  How came she by that light?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentlewoman</sc>  Why, it stood by her. She has light by</p>

<p>her continually. ’Tis her command.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  You see her eyes are open.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentlewoman</sc>  Ay, but their sense are shut.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  What is it she does now? Look how she rubs</p>

<p>her hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentlewoman</sc>  It is an accustomed action with her to</p>

<p>seem thus washing her hands. I have known her</p>

<p>continue in this a quarter of an hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  Yet here’s a spot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes</p>

<p>from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more</p>

<p>strongly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  Out, damned spot, out, I say! One. Two.</p>

<p>Why then, ’tis time to do ’t. Hell is murky. Fie, my</p>

<p>lord, fie, a soldier and afeard? What need we fear</p>

<p>who knows it, when none can call our power to</p>

<p>account? Yet who would have thought the old man</p>

<p>to have had so much blood in him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Do you mark that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is</p>

<p>she now? What, will these hands ne’er be clean? No</p>

<p>more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that. You mar all</p>

<p>with this starting.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Go to, go to. You have known what you should</p>

<p>not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentlewoman</sc>  She has spoke what she should not,</p>

<p>I am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has</p>

<p>known.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  Here’s the smell of the blood still. All</p>

<p>the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little</p>

<p>hand. O, O, O!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely</p>

<p>charged.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentlewoman</sc>  I would not have such a heart in my</p>

<p>bosom for the dignity of the whole body.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Well, well, well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentlewoman</sc>  Pray God it be, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have</p>

<p>known those which have walked in their sleep,</p>

<p>who have died holily in their beds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown.</p>

<p>Look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo’s</p>

<p>buried; he cannot come out on ’s grave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Even so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Macbeth</sc>  To bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the</p>

<p>gate. Come, come, come, come. Give me your</p>

<p>hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to</p>

<p>bed, to bed.     <i><i>[Lady Macbeth exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Will she go now to bed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentlewoman</sc>  Directly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>Foul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds</p>

<p>Do breed unnatural troubles. Infected minds</p>

<p>To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.</p>

<p>More needs she the divine than the physician.</p>

<p>God, God forgive us all. Look after her.</p>

<p>Remove from her the means of all annoyance</p>

<p>And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night.</p>

<p>My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.</p>

<p>I think but dare not speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentlewoman</sc>  Good night, good doctor.</p>
