<p><center><i>[Enter Agrippa, Maecenas, and Caesar.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more</p>

<p>In Alexandria. Here’s the manner of ’t:</p>

<p>I’ th’ marketplace, on a tribunal silvered,</p>

<p>Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold</p>

<p>Were publicly enthroned. At the feet sat</p>

<p>Caesarion, whom they call my father’s son,</p>

<p>And all the unlawful issue that their lust</p>

<p>Since then hath made between them. Unto her</p>

<p>He gave the stablishment of Egypt, made her</p>

<p>Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,</p>

<p>Absolute queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maecenas</span>  This in the public eye?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>I’ th’ common showplace where they exercise.</p>

<p>His sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings.</p>

<p>Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia</p>

<p>He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assigned</p>

<p>Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She</p>

<p>In th’ habiliments of the goddess Isis</p>

<p>That day appeared, and oft before gave audience,</p>

<p>As ’tis reported, so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maecenas</span>  Let Rome be thus informed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agrippa</span></p>

<p>Who, queasy with his insolence already,</p>

<p>Will their good thoughts call from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>The people knows it and have now received</p>

<p>His accusations.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agrippa</span>  Who does he accuse?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Caesar, and that, having in Sicily</p>

<p>Sextus Pompeius spoiled, we had not rated him</p>

<p>His part o’ th’ isle. Then does he say he lent me</p>

<p>Some shipping, unrestored. Lastly, he frets</p>

<p>That Lepidus of the triumvirate</p>

<p>Should be deposed and, being, that we detain</p>

<p>All his revenue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agrippa</span>  Sir, this should be answered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>’Tis done already, and the messenger gone.</p>

<p>I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,</p>

<p>That he his high authority abused</p>

<p>And did deserve his change. For what I have</p>

<p>conquered,</p>

<p>I grant him part; but then in his Armenia</p>

<p>And other of his conquered kingdoms I</p>

<p>Demand the like.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maecenas</span>  He’ll never yield to that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Nor must not then be yielded to in this.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Octavia with her Train.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavia</span></p>

<p>Hail, Caesar, and my lord! Hail, most dear Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>That ever I should call thee castaway!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavia</span></p>

<p>You have not called me so, nor have you cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Why have you stol’n upon us thus? You come not</p>

<p>Like Caesar’s sister. The wife of Antony</p>

<p>Should have an army for an usher and</p>

<p>The neighs of horse to tell of her approach</p>

<p>Long ere she did appear. The trees by th’ way</p>

<p>Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,</p>

<p>Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust</p>

<p>Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,</p>

<p>Raised by your populous troops. But you are come</p>

<p>A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented</p>

<p>The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,</p>

<p>Is often left unloved. We should have met you</p>

<p>By sea and land, supplying every stage</p>

<p>With an augmented greeting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavia</span>  Good my lord,</p>

<p>To come thus was I not constrained, but did it</p>

<p>On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,</p>

<p>Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted</p>

<p>My grieved ear withal, whereon I begged</p>

<p>His pardon for return.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Which soon he granted,</p>

<p>Being an abstract ’tween his lust and him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavia</span></p>

<p>Do not say so, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  I have eyes upon him,</p>

<p>And his affairs come to me on the wind.</p>

<p>Where is he now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavia</span>  My lord, in Athens.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>No, my most wronged sister. Cleopatra</p>

<p>Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire</p>

<p>Up to a whore, who now are levying</p>

<p>The kings o’ th’ Earth for war. He hath assembled</p>

<p>Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus</p>

<p>Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King</p>

<p>Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;</p>

<p>King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;</p>

<p>Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, King</p>

<p>Of Comagen; Polemon and Amyntas,</p>

<p>The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia,</p>

<p>With a more larger list of scepters.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavia</span>  Ay me, most wretched,</p>

<p>That have my heart parted betwixt two friends</p>

<p>That does afflict each other!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Welcome hither.</p>

<p>Your letters did withhold our breaking forth</p>

<p>Till we perceived both how you were wrong led</p>

<p>And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart.</p>

<p>Be you not troubled with the time, which drives</p>

<p>O’er your content these strong necessities,</p>

<p>But let determined things to destiny</p>

<p>Hold unbewailed their way. Welcome to Rome,</p>

<p>Nothing more dear to me. You are abused</p>

<p>Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,</p>

<p>To do you justice, makes his ministers</p>

<p>Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,</p>

<p>And ever welcome to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agrippa</span>  Welcome, lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maecenas</span>  Welcome, dear madam.</p>

<p>Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;</p>

<p>Only th’ adulterous Antony, most large</p>

<p>In his abominations, turns you off</p>

<p>And gives his potent regiment to a trull</p>

<p>That noises it against us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavia</span> <i>[to Caesar]</i>  Is it so, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you</p>

<p>Be ever known to patience. My dear’st sister!</p>
