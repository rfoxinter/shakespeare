<p><center><i>[Enter Octavius Caesar, reading a letter,</p>

<p>Lepidus, and their Train.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,</p>

<p>It is not Caesar’s natural vice to hate</p>

<p>Our great competitor. From Alexandria</p>

<p>This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes</p>

<p>The lamps of night in revel, is not more manlike</p>

<p>Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy</p>

<p>More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or</p>

<p>Vouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall</p>

<p>find there</p>

<p>A man who is th’ abstract of all faults</p>

<p>That all men follow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lepidus</span>  I must not think there are</p>

<p>Evils enough to darken all his goodness.</p>

<p>His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,</p>

<p>More fiery by night’s blackness, hereditary</p>

<p>Rather than purchased, what he cannot change</p>

<p>Than what he chooses.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>You are too indulgent. Let’s grant it is not</p>

<p>Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,</p>

<p>To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit</p>

<p>And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,</p>

<p>To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet</p>

<p>With knaves that smells of sweat. Say this becomes</p>

<p>him–</p>

<p>As his composure must be rare indeed</p>

<p>Whom these things cannot blemish–yet must</p>

<p>Antony</p>

<p>No way excuse his foils when we do bear</p>

<p>So great weight in his lightness. If he filled</p>

<p>His vacancy with his voluptuousness,</p>

<p>Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones</p>

<p>Call on him for ’t. But to confound such time</p>

<p>That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud</p>

<p>As his own state and ours, ’tis to be chid</p>

<p>As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,</p>

<p>Pawn their experience to their present pleasure</p>

<p>And so rebel to judgment.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lepidus</span>  Here’s more news.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Thy biddings have been done, and every hour,</p>

<p>Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report</p>

<p>How ’tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,</p>

<p>And it appears he is beloved of those</p>

<p>That only have feared Caesar. To the ports</p>

<p>The discontents repair, and men’s reports</p>

<p>Give him much wronged.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  I should have known no less.</p>

<p>It hath been taught us from the primal state</p>

<p>That he which is was wished until he were,</p>

<p>And the ebbed man, ne’er loved till ne’er worth love,</p>

<p>Comes feared by being lacked. This common body,</p>

<p>Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,</p>

<p>Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide</p>

<p>To rot itself with motion.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Second Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Caesar, I bring thee word</p>

<p>Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,</p>

<p>Makes the sea serve them, which they ear and</p>

<p>wound</p>

<p>With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads</p>

<p>They make in Italy–the borders maritime</p>

<p>Lack blood to think on ’t–and flush youth revolt.</p>

<p>No vessel can peep forth but ’tis as soon</p>

<p>Taken as seen, for Pompey’s name strikes more</p>

<p>Than could his war resisted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Antony,</p>

<p>Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once</p>

<p>Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st</p>

<p>Hirsius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel</p>

<p>Did famine follow, whom thou fought’st against,</p>

<p>Though daintily brought up, with patience more</p>

<p>Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink</p>

<p>The stale of horses and the gilded puddle</p>

<p>Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did</p>

<p>deign</p>

<p>The roughest berry on the rudest hedge.</p>

<p>Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,</p>

<p>The barks of trees thou browsed. On the Alps</p>

<p>It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh</p>

<p>Which some did die to look on. And all this–</p>

<p>It wounds thine honor that I speak it now–</p>

<p>Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek</p>

<p>So much as lanked not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lepidus</span>  ’Tis pity of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Let his shames quickly</p>

<p>Drive him to Rome. ’Tis time we twain</p>

<p>Did show ourselves i’ th’ field, and to that end</p>

<p>Assemble we immediate council. Pompey</p>

<p>Thrives in our idleness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lepidus</span>  Tomorrow, Caesar,</p>

<p>I shall be furnished to inform you rightly</p>

<p>Both what by sea and land I can be able</p>

<p>To front this present time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Till which encounter,</p>

<p>It is my business too. Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lepidus</span></p>

<p>Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime</p>

<p>Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,</p>

<p>To let me be partaker.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Doubt not, sir. I knew it for my bond.</p>
