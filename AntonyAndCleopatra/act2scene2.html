<p><center><i>[Enter Enobarbus and Lepidus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lepidus</sc></p>

<p>Good Enobarbus, ’tis a worthy deed,</p>

<p>And shall become you well, to entreat your captain</p>

<p>To soft and gentle speech.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  I shall entreat him</p>

<p>To answer like himself. If Caesar move him,</p>

<p>Let Antony look over Caesar’s head</p>

<p>And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,</p>

<p>Were I the wearer of Antonio’s beard,</p>

<p>I would not shave ’t today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lepidus</sc></p>

<p>’Tis not a time for private stomaching.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  Every time serves for the matter that is</p>

<p>then born in ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lepidus</sc></p>

<p>But small to greater matters must give way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  Not if the small come first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lepidus</sc></p>

<p>Your speech is passion; but pray you stir</p>

<p>No embers up. Here comes the noble Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter, at one door, Antony and Ventidius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  And yonder Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter, at another door, Caesar,</p>

<p>Maecenas, and Agrippa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc> <i>[to Ventidius]</i></p>

<p>If we compose well here, to Parthia.</p>

<p>Hark, Ventidius.     <i><i>[They talk aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc> <i>[to Maecenas]</i></p>

<p>I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lepidus</sc> <i>[to Caesar and Antony]</i>  Noble friends,</p>

<p>That which combined us was most great, and let not</p>

<p>A leaner action rend us. What’s amiss,</p>

<p>May it be gently heard. When we debate</p>

<p>Our trivial difference loud, we do commit</p>

<p>Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,</p>

<p>The rather for I earnestly beseech,</p>

<p>Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,</p>

<p>Nor curstness grow to th’ matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  ’Tis spoken well.</p>

<p>Were we before our armies, and to fight,</p>

<p>I should do thus.     <i><i>[Flourish.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Welcome to Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Thank you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Sit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Sit, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Nay, then.     <i><i>[They sit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>I learn you take things ill which are not so,</p>

<p>Or, being, concern you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  I must be laughed at</p>

<p>If or for nothing or a little, I</p>

<p>Should say myself offended, and with you</p>

<p>Chiefly i’ th’ world; more laughed at, that I should</p>

<p>Once name you derogately when to sound your</p>

<p>name</p>

<p>It not concerned me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was ’t to you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>No more than my residing here at Rome</p>

<p>Might be to you in Egypt. Yet if you there</p>

<p>Did practice on my state, your being in Egypt</p>

<p>Might be my question.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  How intend you, practiced?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>You may be pleased to catch at mine intent</p>

<p>By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother</p>

<p>Made wars upon me, and their contestation</p>

<p>Was theme for you; you were the word of war.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>You do mistake your business. My brother never</p>

<p>Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,</p>

<p>And have my learning from some true reports</p>

<p>That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather</p>

<p>Discredit my authority with yours,</p>

<p>And make the wars alike against my stomach,</p>

<p>Having alike your cause? Of this my letters</p>

<p>Before did satisfy you. If you’ll patch a quarrel,</p>

<p>As matter whole you have to make it with,</p>

<p>It must not be with this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  You praise yourself</p>

<p>By laying defects of judgment to me; but</p>

<p>You patched up your excuses.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Not so, not so.</p>

<p>I know you could not lack–I am certain on ’t–</p>

<p>Very necessity of this thought, that I,</p>

<p>Your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought,</p>

<p>Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars</p>

<p>Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,</p>

<p>I would you had her spirit in such another.</p>

<p>The third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle</p>

<p>You may pace easy, but not such a wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  Would we had all such wives, that the men</p>

<p>might go to wars with the women!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,</p>

<p>Made out of her impatience–which not wanted</p>

<p>Shrewdness of policy too–I grieving grant</p>

<p>Did you too much disquiet. For that you must</p>

<p>But say I could not help it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  I wrote to you</p>

<p>When rioting in Alexandria; you</p>

<p>Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts</p>

<p>Did gibe my missive out of audience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Sir,</p>

<p>He fell upon me ere admitted, then;</p>

<p>Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want</p>

<p>Of what I was i’ th’ morning. But next day</p>

<p>I told him of myself, which was as much</p>

<p>As to have asked him pardon. Let this fellow</p>

<p>Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,</p>

<p>Out of our question wipe him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  You have broken</p>

<p>The article of your oath, which you shall never</p>

<p>Have tongue to charge me with.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lepidus</sc>  Soft, Caesar!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  No, Lepidus, let him speak.</p>

<p>The honor is sacred which he talks on now,</p>

<p>Supposing that I lacked it.–But on, Caesar:</p>

<p>The article of my oath?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>To lend me arms and aid when I required them,</p>

<p>The which you both denied.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Neglected, rather;</p>

<p>And then when poisoned hours had bound me up</p>

<p>From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may</p>

<p>I’ll play the penitent to you. But mine honesty</p>

<p>Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power</p>

<p>Work without it. Truth is that Fulvia,</p>

<p>To have me out of Egypt, made wars here,</p>

<p>For which myself, the ignorant motive, do</p>

<p>So far ask pardon as befits mine honor</p>

<p>To stoop in such a case.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lepidus</sc>  ’Tis noble spoken.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maecenas</sc></p>

<p>If it might please you to enforce no further</p>

<p>The griefs between you, to forget them quite</p>

<p>Were to remember that the present need</p>

<p>Speaks to atone you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lepidus</sc>  Worthily spoken, Maecenas.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  Or, if you borrow one another’s love for</p>

<p>the instant, you may, when you hear no more words</p>

<p>of Pompey, return it again. You shall have time to</p>

<p>wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  That truth should be silent I had almost</p>

<p>forgot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  Go to, then. Your considerate stone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>I do not much dislike the matter, but</p>

<p>The manner of his speech; for ’t cannot be</p>

<p>We shall remain in friendship, our conditions</p>

<p>So diff’ring in their acts. Yet if I knew</p>

<p>What hoop should hold us staunch, from edge to</p>

<p>edge</p>

<p>O’ th’ world I would pursue it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agrippa</sc>  Give me leave, Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Speak, Agrippa.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agrippa</sc></p>

<p>Thou hast a sister by the mother’s side,</p>

<p>Admired Octavia. Great Mark Antony</p>

<p>Is now a widower.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Say not so, Agrippa.</p>

<p>If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof</p>

<p>Were well deserved of rashness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear</p>

<p>Agrippa further speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agrippa</sc></p>

<p>To hold you in perpetual amity,</p>

<p>To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts</p>

<p>With an unslipping knot, take Antony</p>

<p>Octavia to his wife, whose beauty claims</p>

<p>No worse a husband than the best of men;</p>

<p>Whose virtue and whose general graces speak</p>

<p>That which none else can utter. By this marriage</p>

<p>All little jealousies, which now seem great,</p>

<p>And all great fears, which now import their dangers,</p>

<p>Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,</p>

<p>Where now half-tales be truths. Her love to both</p>

<p>Would each to other and all loves to both</p>

<p>Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,</p>

<p>For ’tis a studied, not a present thought,</p>

<p>By duty ruminated.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Will Caesar speak?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>Not till he hears how Antony is touched</p>

<p>With what is spoke already.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  What power is in Agrippa,</p>

<p>If I would say “Agrippa, be it so,”</p>

<p>To make this good?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  The power of Caesar, and</p>

<p>His power unto Octavia.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  May I never</p>

<p>To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,</p>

<p>Dream of impediment. Let me have thy hand.</p>

<p>Further this act of grace; and from this hour</p>

<p>The heart of brothers govern in our loves</p>

<p>And sway our great designs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  There’s my hand.</p>

<p><center><i>[They clasp hands.]</i></center></p>

<p>A sister I bequeath you whom no brother</p>

<p>Did ever love so dearly. Let her live</p>

<p>To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never</p>

<p>Fly off our loves again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lepidus</sc>  Happily, amen!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>I did not think to draw my sword ’gainst Pompey,</p>

<p>For he hath laid strange courtesies and great</p>

<p>Of late upon me. I must thank him only,</p>

<p>Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;</p>

<p>At heel of that, defy him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lepidus</sc>  Time calls upon ’s.</p>

<p>Of us must Pompey presently be sought,</p>

<p>Or else he seeks out us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Where lies he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  About the Mount Misena.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  What is his strength by land?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Great and increasing;</p>

<p>But by sea he is an absolute master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  So is the fame.</p>

<p>Would we had spoke together. Haste we for it.</p>

<p>Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we</p>

<p>The business we have talked of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  With most gladness,</p>

<p>And do invite you to my sister’s view,</p>

<p>Whither straight I’ll lead you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Let us, Lepidus, not lack your company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lepidus</sc></p>

<p>Noble Antony, not sickness should detain me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. All but Enobarbus, Agrippa, and</p>

<p>Maecenas exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maecenas</sc> <i>[to Enobarbus]</i>  Welcome from Egypt, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  Half the heart of Caesar, worthy</p>

<p>Maecenas!–My honorable friend Agrippa!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agrippa</sc>  Good Enobarbus!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maecenas</sc>  We have cause to be glad that matters are so</p>

<p>well digested. You stayed well by ’t in Egypt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  Ay, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance</p>

<p>and made the night light with drinking.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maecenas</sc>  Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast,</p>

<p>and but twelve persons there. Is this true?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had</p>

<p>much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily</p>

<p>deserved noting.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maecenas</sc>  She’s a most triumphant lady, if report be</p>

<p>square to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  When she first met Mark Antony, she</p>

<p>pursed up his heart upon the river of Cydnus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agrippa</sc>  There she appeared indeed, or my reporter</p>

<p>devised well for her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  I will tell you.</p>

<p>The barge she sat in like a burnished throne</p>

<p>Burned on the water. The poop was beaten gold,</p>

<p>Purple the sails, and so perfumed that</p>

<p>The winds were lovesick with them. The oars were</p>

<p>silver,</p>

<p>Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</p>

<p>The water which they beat to follow faster,</p>

<p>As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</p>

<p>It beggared all description: she did lie</p>

<p>In her pavilion–cloth-of-gold, of tissue–</p>

<p>O’erpicturing that Venus where we see</p>

<p>The fancy outwork nature. On each side her</p>

<p>Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,</p>

<p>With divers-colored fans, whose wind did seem</p>

<p>To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,</p>

<p>And what they undid did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agrippa</sc>  O, rare for Antony!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc></p>

<p>Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,</p>

<p>So many mermaids, tended her i’ th’ eyes,</p>

<p>And made their bends adornings. At the helm</p>

<p>A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle</p>

<p>Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands</p>

<p>That yarely frame the office. From the barge</p>

<p>A strange invisible perfume hits the sense</p>

<p>Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast</p>

<p>Her people out upon her; and Antony,</p>

<p>Enthroned i’ th’ market-place, did sit alone,</p>

<p>Whistling to th’ air, which but for vacancy</p>

<p>Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too</p>

<p>And made a gap in nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agrippa</sc>  Rare Egyptian!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc></p>

<p>Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,</p>

<p>Invited her to supper. She replied</p>

<p>It should be better he became her guest,</p>

<p>Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,</p>

<p>Whom ne’er the word of “No” woman heard speak,</p>

<p>Being barbered ten times o’er, goes to the feast,</p>

<p>And for his ordinary pays his heart</p>

<p>For what his eyes eat only.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agrippa</sc>  Royal wench!</p>

<p>She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;</p>

<p>He ploughed her, and she cropped.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  I saw her once</p>

<p>Hop forty paces through the public street,</p>

<p>And having lost her breath, she spoke and panted,</p>

<p>That she did make defect perfection,</p>

<p>And breathless pour breath forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maecenas</sc></p>

<p>Now Antony must leave her utterly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  Never. He will not.</p>

<p>Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale</p>

<p>Her infinite variety. Other women cloy</p>

<p>The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry</p>

<p>Where most she satisfies. For vilest things</p>

<p>Become themselves in her, that the holy priests</p>

<p>Bless her when she is riggish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maecenas</sc></p>

<p>If beauty, wisdom, modesty can settle</p>

<p>The heart of Antony, Octavia is</p>

<p>A blessed lottery to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agrippa</sc>  Let us go.</p>

<p>Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest</p>

<p>Whilst you abide here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  Humbly, sir, I thank you.</p>
