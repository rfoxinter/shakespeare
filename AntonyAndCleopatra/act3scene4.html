<p><center><i>[Enter Antony and Octavia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that–</p>

<p>That were excusable, that and thousands more</p>

<p>Of semblable import–but he hath waged</p>

<p>New wars ’gainst Pompey; made his will and read it</p>

<p>To public ear;</p>

<p>Spoke scantly of me; when perforce he could not</p>

<p>But pay me terms of honor, cold and sickly</p>

<p>He vented them, most narrow measure lent me;</p>

<p>When the best hint was given him, he not took ’t,</p>

<p>Or did it from his teeth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavia</span>  O, my good lord,</p>

<p>Believe not all, or if you must believe,</p>

<p>Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,</p>

<p>If this division chance, ne’er stood between,</p>

<p>Praying for both parts.</p>

<p>The good gods will mock me presently</p>

<p>When I shall pray “O, bless my lord and husband!”</p>

<p>Undo that prayer by crying out as loud</p>

<p>“O, bless my brother!” Husband win, win brother</p>

<p>Prays and destroys the prayer; no midway</p>

<p>’Twixt these extremes at all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Gentle Octavia,</p>

<p>Let your best love draw to that point which seeks</p>

<p>Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honor,</p>

<p>I lose myself; better I were not yours</p>

<p>Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,</p>

<p>Yourself shall go between ’s. The meantime, lady,</p>

<p>I’ll raise the preparation of a war</p>

<p>Shall stain your brother. Make your soonest haste,</p>

<p>So your desires are yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavia</span>  Thanks to my lord.</p>

<p>The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak,</p>

<p>Your reconciler. Wars ’twixt you twain would be</p>

<p>As if the world should cleave, and that slain men</p>

<p>Should solder up the rift.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>When it appears to you where this begins,</p>

<p>Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults</p>

<p>Can never be so equal that your love</p>

<p>Can equally move with them. Provide your going;</p>

<p>Choose your own company, and command what cost</p>

<p>Your heart has mind to.</p>
