<p><center><i>[Enter Caesar with Agrippa, Dolabella, Maecenas,</p>

<p>Gallus, and Proculeius, his council of war.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span> <i>[aside to Dolabella]</i></p>

<p>Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield.</p>

<p>Being so frustrate, tell him, he mocks</p>

<p>The pauses that he makes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dolabella</span>  Caesar, I shall.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dolabella exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dercetus with the sword of Antony.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar’st</p>

<p>Appear thus to us?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dercetus</span>  I am called Dercetus.</p>

<p>Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy</p>

<p>Best to be served. Whilst he stood up and spoke,</p>

<p>He was my master, and I wore my life</p>

<p>To spend upon his haters. If thou please</p>

<p>To take me to thee, as I was to him</p>

<p>I’ll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,</p>

<p>I yield thee up my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  What is ’t thou say’st?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dercetus</span></p>

<p>I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>The breaking of so great a thing should make</p>

<p>A greater crack. The round world</p>

<p>Should have shook lions into civil streets</p>

<p>And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony</p>

<p>Is not a single doom; in the name lay</p>

<p>A moiety of the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dercetus</span>  He is dead, Caesar,</p>

<p>Not by a public minister of justice,</p>

<p>Nor by a hired knife, but that self hand</p>

<p>Which writ his honor in the acts it did</p>

<p>Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,</p>

<p>Splitted the heart. This is his sword.</p>

<p>I robbed his wound of it. Behold it stained</p>

<p>With his most noble blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Look you sad, friends?</p>

<p>The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings</p>

<p>To wash the eyes of kings.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agrippa</span>  And strange it is</p>

<p>That nature must compel us to lament</p>

<p>Our most persisted deeds.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maecenas</span>  His taints and honors</p>

<p>Waged equal with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agrippa</span>  A rarer spirit never</p>

<p>Did steer humanity, but you gods will give us</p>

<p>Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touched.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maecenas</span></p>

<p>When such a spacious mirror’s set before him,</p>

<p>He needs must see himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  O Antony,</p>

<p>I have followed thee to this, but we do lance</p>

<p>Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce</p>

<p>Have shown to thee such a declining day</p>

<p>Or look on thine. We could not stall together</p>

<p>In the whole world. But yet let me lament</p>

<p>With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts</p>

<p>That thou my brother, my competitor</p>

<p>In top of all design, my mate in empire,</p>

<p>Friend and companion in the front of war,</p>

<p>The arm of mine own body, and the heart</p>

<p>Where mine his thoughts did kindle–that our stars</p>

<p>Unreconciliable should divide</p>

<p>Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter an Egyptian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But I will tell you at some meeter season.</p>

<p>The business of this man looks out of him.</p>

<p>We’ll hear him what he says.–Whence are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Egyptian</span></p>

<p>A poor Egyptian yet, the Queen my mistress,</p>

<p>Confined in all she has, her monument,</p>

<p>Of thy intents desires instruction,</p>

<p>That she preparedly may frame herself</p>

<p>To th’ way she’s forced to.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Bid her have good heart.</p>

<p>She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,</p>

<p>How honorable and how kindly we</p>

<p>Determine for her. For Caesar cannot live</p>

<p>To be ungentle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Egyptian</span>  So the gods preserve thee.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say</p>

<p>We purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts</p>

<p>The quality of her passion shall require,</p>

<p>Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke</p>

<p>She do defeat us, for her life in Rome</p>

<p>Would be eternal in our triumph. Go,</p>

<p>And with your speediest bring us what she says</p>

<p>And how you find of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proculeius</span>  Caesar, I shall.</p>

<p><center><i>[Proculeius exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Gallus, go you along.     <i><i>[Gallus exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Where’s Dolabella,</p>

<p>To second Proculeius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  Dolabella!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Let him alone, for I remember now</p>

<p>How he’s employed. He shall in time be ready.</p>

<p>Go with me to my tent, where you shall see</p>

<p>How hardly I was drawn into this war,</p>

<p>How calm and gentle I proceeded still</p>

<p>In all my writings. Go with me and see</p>

<p>What I can show in this.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
