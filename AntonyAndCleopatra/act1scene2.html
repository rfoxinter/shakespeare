<p><center><i>[Enter Enobarbus, Lamprius, a Soothsayer, Rannius,</p>

<p>Lucillius, Charmian, Iras, Mardian the Eunuch, Alexas,</p>

<p>and Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything</p>

<p>Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where’s the</p>

<p>soothsayer that you praised so to th’ Queen? O, that</p>

<p>I knew this husband which you say must charge</p>

<p>his horns with garlands!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alexas</span>  Soothsayer!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span>  Your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span></p>

<p>Is this the man?–Is ’t you, sir, that know things?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span></p>

<p>In nature’s infinite book of secrecy</p>

<p>A little I can read.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alexas</span> <i>[to Charmian]</i>  Show him your hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span> <i>[to Servants]</i></p>

<p>Bring in the banquet quickly, wine enough</p>

<p>Cleopatra’s health to drink.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span> <i>[giving her hand to the Soothsayer]</i>  Good sir,</p>

<p>give me good fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span>  I make not, but foresee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  Pray then, foresee me one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span></p>

<p>You shall be yet far fairer than you are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  He means in flesh.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iras</span>  No, you shall paint when you are old.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  Wrinkles forbid!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alexas</span>  Vex not his prescience. Be attentive.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  Hush.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span></p>

<p>You shall be more beloving than beloved.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  I had rather heat my liver with drinking.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alexas</span>  Nay, hear him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me</p>

<p>be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow</p>

<p>them all. Let me have a child at fifty to whom Herod</p>

<p>of Jewry may do homage. Find me to marry me</p>

<p>with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my</p>

<p>mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span></p>

<p>You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span></p>

<p>You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune</p>

<p>Than that which is to approach.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  Then belike my children shall have no</p>

<p>names. Prithee, how many boys and wenches must</p>

<p>I have?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span></p>

<p>If every of your wishes had a womb,</p>

<p>And fertile every wish, a million.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alexas</span>  You think none but your sheets are privy to</p>

<p>your wishes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span> <i>[to Soothsayer]</i>  Nay, come. Tell Iras hers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alexas</span>  We’ll know all our fortunes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight,</p>

<p>shall be–drunk to bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iras</span> <i>[giving her hand to the Soothsayer]</i>  There’s a palm</p>

<p>presages chastity, if nothing else.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  E’en as the o’erflowing Nilus presageth</p>

<p>famine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iras</span>  Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication,</p>

<p>I cannot scratch mine ear.–Prithee</p>

<p>tell her but a workaday fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span>  Your fortunes are alike.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iras</span>  But how, but how? Give me particulars.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span>  I have said.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iras</span>  Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  Well, if you were but an inch of fortune</p>

<p>better than I, where would you choose it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iras</span>  Not in my husband’s nose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  Our worser thoughts heavens mend. Alexas–</p>

<p>come, his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a</p>

<p>woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee, and</p>

<p>let her die, too, and give him a worse, and let worse</p>

<p>follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing</p>

<p>to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold. Good Isis, hear me</p>

<p>this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more</p>

<p>weight, good Isis, I beseech thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iras</span>  Amen, dear goddess, hear that prayer of the</p>

<p>people. For, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome</p>

<p>man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to</p>

<p>behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore, dear</p>

<p>Isis, keep decorum and fortune him accordingly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alexas</span>  Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a</p>

<p>cuckold, they would make themselves whores but</p>

<p>they’d do ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Hush, here comes Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  Not he. The Queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cleopatra.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleopatra</span>  Saw you my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  No, lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleopatra</span>  Was he not here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charmian</span>  No, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleopatra</span></p>

<p>He was disposed to mirth, but on the sudden</p>

<p>A Roman thought hath struck him.–Enobarbus!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleopatra</span></p>

<p>Seek him and bring him hither.–Where’s Alexas?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alexas</span></p>

<p>Here at your service. My lord approaches.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antony with a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleopatra</span></p>

<p>We will not look upon him. Go with us.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Antony and the Messenger exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Against my brother Lucius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Ay.</p>

<p>But soon that war had end, and the time’s state</p>

<p>Made friends of them, jointing their force ’gainst</p>

<p>Caesar,</p>

<p>Whose better issue in the war from Italy</p>

<p>Upon the first encounter drave them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Well, what worst?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>The nature of bad news infects the teller.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>When it concerns the fool or coward. On.</p>

<p>Things that are past are done, with me. ’Tis thus:</p>

<p>Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,</p>

<p>I hear him as he flattered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Labienus–</p>

<p>This is stiff news–hath with his Parthian force</p>

<p>Extended Asia: from Euphrates</p>

<p>His conquering banner shook, from Syria</p>

<p>To Lydia and to Ionia,</p>

<p>Whilst–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  “Antony,” thou wouldst say?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  O, my lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue.</p>

<p>Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome;</p>

<p>Rail thou in Fulvia’s phrase, and taunt my faults</p>

<p>With such full license as both truth and malice</p>

<p>Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds</p>

<p>When our quick winds lie still, and our ills told us</p>

<p>Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  At your noble pleasure.     <i><i>[Messenger exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter another Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>From Sicyon how the news? Speak there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>The man from Sicyon–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Is there such an one?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>He stays upon your will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Let him appear.</p>

<p><center><i>[Second Messenger exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,</p>

<p>Or lose myself in dotage.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter another Messenger with a letter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Fulvia thy wife is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Where died she?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  In Sicyon.</p>

<p>Her length of sickness, with what else more serious</p>

<p>Importeth thee to know, this bears.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands Antony the letter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Forbear me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Third Messenger exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>There’s a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.</p>

<p>What our contempts doth often hurl from us,</p>

<p>We wish it ours again. The present pleasure,</p>

<p>By revolution lowering, does become</p>

<p>The opposite of itself. She’s good, being gone.</p>

<p>The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.</p>

<p>I must from this enchanting queen break off.</p>

<p>Ten thousand harms more than the ills I know</p>

<p>My idleness doth hatch.–How now, Enobarbus!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Enobarbus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  What’s your pleasure, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  I must with haste from hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Why then we kill all our women. We see</p>

<p>how mortal an unkindness is to them. If they suffer</p>

<p>our departure, death’s the word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  I must be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Under a compelling occasion, let women</p>

<p>die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing,</p>

<p>though between them and a great cause, they</p>

<p>should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching</p>

<p>but the least noise of this, dies instantly. I have seen</p>

<p>her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do</p>

<p>think there is mettle in death which commits some</p>

<p>loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in</p>

<p>dying.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  She is cunning past man’s thought.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of</p>

<p>nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot</p>

<p>call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are</p>

<p>greater storms and tempests than almanacs can</p>

<p>report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she</p>

<p>makes a shower of rain as well as Jove.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Would I had never seen her!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful</p>

<p>piece of work, which not to have been blest</p>

<p>withal would have discredited your travel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Fulvia is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Fulvia is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Fulvia?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.</p>

<p>When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a</p>

<p>man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the</p>

<p>Earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are</p>

<p>worn out, there are members to make new. If there</p>

<p>were no more women but Fulvia, then had you</p>

<p>indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief</p>

<p>is crowned with consolation; your old smock brings</p>

<p>forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an</p>

<p>onion that should water this sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>The business she hath broached in the state</p>

<p>Cannot endure my absence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  And the business you have broached here</p>

<p>cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra’s,</p>

<p>which wholly depends on your abode.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>No more light answers. Let our officers</p>

<p>Have notice what we purpose. I shall break</p>

<p>The cause of our expedience to the Queen</p>

<p>And get her leave to part. For not alone</p>

<p>The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,</p>

<p>Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too</p>

<p>Of many our contriving friends in Rome</p>

<p>Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius</p>

<p>Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands</p>

<p>The empire of the sea. Our slippery people,</p>

<p>Whose love is never linked to the deserver</p>

<p>Till his deserts are past, begin to throw</p>

<p>Pompey the Great and all his dignities</p>

<p>Upon his son, who–high in name and power,</p>

<p>Higher than both in blood and life–stands up</p>

<p>For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,</p>

<p>The sides o’ th’ world may danger. Much is</p>

<p>breeding</p>

<p>Which, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life</p>

<p>And not a serpent’s poison. Say our pleasure,</p>

<p>To such whose place is under us, requires</p>

<p>Our quick remove from hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  I shall do ’t.</p>
