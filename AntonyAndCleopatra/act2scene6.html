<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter Pompey and Menas at one door,</p>

<p>with Drum and Trumpet; at another Caesar, Lepidus,</p>

<p>Antony, Enobarbus, Maecenas, and Agrippa,</p>

<p>with Soldiers marching.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span></p>

<p>Your hostages I have, so have you mine,</p>

<p>And we shall talk before we fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Most meet</p>

<p>That first we come to words, and therefore have we</p>

<p>Our written purposes before us sent,</p>

<p>Which if thou hast considered, let us know</p>

<p>If ’twill tie up thy discontented sword</p>

<p>And carry back to Sicily much tall youth</p>

<p>That else must perish here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  To you all three,</p>

<p>The senators alone of this great world,</p>

<p>Chief factors for the gods: I do not know</p>

<p>Wherefore my father should revengers want,</p>

<p>Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,</p>

<p>Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,</p>

<p>There saw you laboring for him. What was ’t</p>

<p>That moved pale Cassius to conspire? And what</p>

<p>Made the all-honored, honest, Roman Brutus,</p>

<p>With the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous</p>

<p>freedom,</p>

<p>To drench the Capitol, but that they would</p>

<p>Have one man but a man? And that is it</p>

<p>Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden</p>

<p>The angered ocean foams, with which I meant</p>

<p>To scourge th’ ingratitude that despiteful Rome</p>

<p>Cast on my noble father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Take your time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails.</p>

<p>We’ll speak with thee at sea. At land thou know’st</p>

<p>How much we do o’ercount thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  At land indeed</p>

<p>Thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house;</p>

<p>But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,</p>

<p>Remain in ’t as thou mayst.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lepidus</span>  Be pleased to tell us–</p>

<p>For this is from the present–how you take</p>

<p>The offers we have sent you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  There’s the point.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>Which do not be entreated to, but weigh</p>

<p>What it is worth embraced.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  And what may follow</p>

<p>To try a larger fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  You have made me offer</p>

<p>Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must</p>

<p>Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send</p>

<p>Measures of wheat to Rome. This ’greed upon,</p>

<p>To part with unhacked edges and bear back</p>

<p>Our targes undinted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  That’s our offer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  Know then</p>

<p>I came before you here a man prepared</p>

<p>To take this offer. But Mark Antony</p>

<p>Put me to some impatience.–Though I lose</p>

<p>The praise of it by telling, you must know</p>

<p>When Caesar and your brother were at blows,</p>

<p>Your mother came to Sicily and did find</p>

<p>Her welcome friendly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  I have heard it, Pompey,</p>

<p>And am well studied for a liberal thanks,</p>

<p>Which I do owe you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  Let me have your hand.</p>

<p><center><i>[They clasp hands.]</i></center></p>

<p>I did not think, sir, to have met you here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>The beds i’ th’ East are soft; and thanks to you,</p>

<p>That called me timelier than my purpose hither,</p>

<p>For I have gained by ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span> <i>[to Pompey]</i>  Since I saw you last,</p>

<p>There’s a change upon you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  Well, I know not</p>

<p>What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face,</p>

<p>But in my bosom shall she never come</p>

<p>To make my heart her vassal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lepidus</span>  Well met here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span></p>

<p>I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.</p>

<p>I crave our composition may be written</p>

<p>And sealed between us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  That’s the next to do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span></p>

<p>We’ll feast each other ere we part, and let’s</p>

<p>Draw lots who shall begin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  That will I, Pompey.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span></p>

<p>No, Antony, take the lot. But, first or last,</p>

<p>Your fine Egyptian cookery shall have</p>

<p>The fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar</p>

<p>Grew fat with feasting there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  You have heard much.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  I have fair meanings, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  And fair words to them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  Then so much have I heard.</p>

<p>And I have heard Apollodorus carried–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span></p>

<p>No more of that. He did so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  What, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span></p>

<p>A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span></p>

<p>I know thee now. How far’st thou, soldier?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Well,</p>

<p>And well am like to do, for I perceive</p>

<p>Four feasts are toward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  Let me shake thy hand.</p>

<p>I never hated thee. I have seen thee fight</p>

<p>When I have envied thy behavior.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Sir,</p>

<p>I never loved you much, but I ha’ praised you</p>

<p>When you have well deserved ten times as much</p>

<p>As I have said you did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  Enjoy thy plainness;</p>

<p>It nothing ill becomes thee.–</p>

<p>Aboard my galley I invite you all.</p>

<p>Will you lead, lords?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  Show ’s the way, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  Come.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit, except for Enobarbus and Menas.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Thy father, Pompey, would ne’er have</p>

<p>made this treaty.–You and I have known, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  At sea, I think.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  We have, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  You have done well by water.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  And you by land.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  I will praise any man that will praise me,</p>

<p>though it cannot be denied what I have done by</p>

<p>land.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  Nor what I have done by water.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Yes, something you can deny for your own</p>

<p>safety: you have been a great thief by sea.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  And you by land.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  There I deny my land service. But give me</p>

<p>your hand, Menas. <i>[They clasp hands.]</i> If our eyes</p>

<p>had authority, here they might take two thieves</p>

<p>kissing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  All men’s faces are true, whatsome’er their</p>

<p>hands are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  But there is never a fair woman has a true</p>

<p>face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  No slander. They steal hearts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  We came hither to fight with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a</p>

<p>drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his</p>

<p>fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  If he do, sure he cannot weep ’t back</p>

<p>again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  You’ve said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony</p>

<p>here. Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Caesar’s sister is called Octavia.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  True, sir. She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  But she is now the wife of Marcus</p>

<p>Antonius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  Pray you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  ’Tis true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  Then is Caesar and he forever knit together.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  If I were bound to divine of this unity, I</p>

<p>would not prophesy so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  I think the policy of that purpose made more in</p>

<p>the marriage than the love of the parties.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  I think so, too. But you shall find the band</p>

<p>that seems to tie their friendship together will be</p>

<p>the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy,</p>

<p>cold, and still conversation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  Who would not have his wife so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  Not he that himself is not so, which is</p>

<p>Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again.</p>

<p>Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in</p>

<p>Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the</p>

<p>strength of their amity shall prove the immediate</p>

<p>author of their variance. Antony will use his affection</p>

<p>where it is. He married but his occasion here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?</p>

<p>I have a health for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Enobarbus</span>  I shall take it, sir. We have used our throats</p>

<p>in Egypt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menas</span>  Come, let’s away.</p>
