<p><center><i>[Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, and Iras.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>My desolation does begin to make</p>

<p>A better life. ’Tis paltry to be Caesar;</p>

<p>Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave,</p>

<p>A minister of her will. And it is great</p>

<p>To do that thing that ends all other deeds,</p>

<p>Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,</p>

<p>Which sleeps and never palates more the dung,</p>

<p>The beggar’s nurse, and Caesar’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Proculeius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proculeius</sc></p>

<p>Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt,</p>

<p>And bids thee study on what fair demands</p>

<p>Thou mean’st to have him grant thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  What’s thy name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proculeius</sc></p>

<p>My name is Proculeius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Antony</p>

<p>Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but</p>

<p>I do not greatly care to be deceived</p>

<p>That have no use for trusting. If your master</p>

<p>Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him</p>

<p>That majesty, to keep decorum, must</p>

<p>No less beg than a kingdom. If he please</p>

<p>To give me conquered Egypt for my son,</p>

<p>He gives me so much of mine own as I</p>

<p>Will kneel to him with thanks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proculeius</sc>  Be of good cheer.</p>

<p>You’re fall’n into a princely hand; fear nothing.</p>

<p>Make your full reference freely to my lord,</p>

<p>Who is so full of grace that it flows over</p>

<p>On all that need. Let me report to him</p>

<p>Your sweet dependency, and you shall find</p>

<p>A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness</p>

<p>Where he for grace is kneeled to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Pray you tell him</p>

<p>I am his fortune’s vassal and I send him</p>

<p>The greatness he has got. I hourly learn</p>

<p>A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly</p>

<p>Look him i’ th’ face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proculeius</sc>  This I’ll report, dear lady.</p>

<p>Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied</p>

<p>Of him that caused it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Gallus and Soldiers enter and seize Cleopatra.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gallus</sc></p>

<p>You see how easily she may be surprised.</p>

<p>Guard her till Caesar come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iras</sc>  Royal queen!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc></p>

<p>O, Cleopatra, thou art taken, queen!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc> <i>[drawing a dagger]</i></p>

<p>Quick, quick, good hands!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proculeius</sc> <i>[seizing the dagger]</i>  Hold, worthy lady, hold!</p>

<p>Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this</p>

<p>Relieved, but not betrayed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  What, of death, too,</p>

<p>That rids our dogs of languish?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proculeius</sc>  Cleopatra,</p>

<p>Do not abuse my master’s bounty by</p>

<p>Th’ undoing of yourself. Let the world see</p>

<p>His nobleness well acted, which your death</p>

<p>Will never let come forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Where art thou, Death?</p>

<p>Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen</p>

<p>Worth many babes and beggars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proculeius</sc>  O, temperance, lady!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Sir, I will eat no meat; I’ll not drink, sir.</p>

<p>If idle talk will once be necessary–</p>

<p>I’ll not sleep neither. This mortal house I’ll ruin,</p>

<p>Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I</p>

<p>Will not wait pinioned at your master’s court,</p>

<p>Nor once be chastised with the sober eye</p>

<p>Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up</p>

<p>And show me to the shouting varletry</p>

<p>Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt</p>

<p>Be gentle grave unto me; rather on Nilus’ mud</p>

<p>Lay me stark naked, and let the waterflies</p>

<p>Blow me into abhorring; rather make</p>

<p>My country’s high pyramides my gibbet</p>

<p>And hang me up in chains!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proculeius</sc>  You do extend</p>

<p>These thoughts of horror further than you shall</p>

<p>Find cause in Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dolabella.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  Proculeius,</p>

<p>What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,</p>

<p>And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,</p>

<p>I’ll take her to my guard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proculeius</sc>  So, Dolabella,</p>

<p>It shall content me best. Be gentle to her.</p>

<p><i>[To Cleopatra.]</i> To Caesar I will speak what you</p>

<p>shall please,</p>

<p>If you’ll employ me to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Say I would die.</p>

<p><center><i>[Proculeius, Gallus, and Soldiers exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc></p>

<p>Most noble empress, you have heard of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>I cannot tell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  Assuredly you know me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.</p>

<p>You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;</p>

<p>Is ’t not your trick?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  I understand not, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>I dreamt there was an emperor Antony.</p>

<p>O, such another sleep, that I might see</p>

<p>But such another man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  If it might please you–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck</p>

<p>A sun and moon, which kept their course and</p>

<p>lighted</p>

<p>The little O, the Earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  Most sovereign creature–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>His legs bestrid the ocean, his reared arm</p>

<p>Crested the world. His voice was propertied</p>

<p>As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;</p>

<p>But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,</p>

<p>He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,</p>

<p>There was no winter in ’t; an autumn ’twas</p>

<p>That grew the more by reaping. His delights</p>

<p>Were dolphin-like; they showed his back above</p>

<p>The element they lived in. In his livery</p>

<p>Walked crowns and crownets; realms and islands</p>

<p>were</p>

<p>As plates dropped from his pocket.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  Cleopatra–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Think you there was, or might be, such a man</p>

<p>As this I dreamt of?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  Gentle madam, no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>You lie up to the hearing of the gods!</p>

<p>But if there be nor ever were one such,</p>

<p>It’s past the size of dreaming. Nature wants stuff</p>

<p>To vie strange forms with fancy, yet t’ imagine</p>

<p>An Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy,</p>

<p>Condemning shadows quite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  Hear me, good madam.</p>

<p>Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it</p>

<p>As answering to the weight. Would I might never</p>

<p>O’ertake pursued success but I do feel,</p>

<p>By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites</p>

<p>My very heart at root.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  I thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Know you what Caesar means to do with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc></p>

<p>I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Nay, pray you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  Though he be honorable–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  He’ll lead me, then, in triumph.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  Madam, he will. I know ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter Caesar, Proculeius, Gallus, Maecenas,</p>

<p>and others of his train.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Make way there! Caesar!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Which is the Queen of Egypt?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  It is the Emperor, madam.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cleopatra kneels.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Arise. You shall not kneel.</p>

<p>I pray you, rise. Rise, Egypt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Sir, the gods</p>

<p>Will have it thus. My master and my lord</p>

<p>I must obey.     <i><i>[She stands.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Take to you no hard thoughts.</p>

<p>The record of what injuries you did us,</p>

<p>Though written in our flesh, we shall remember</p>

<p>As things but done by chance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Sole sir o’ th’ world,</p>

<p>I cannot project mine own cause so well</p>

<p>To make it clear, but do confess I have</p>

<p>Been laden with like frailties which before</p>

<p>Have often shamed our sex.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Cleopatra, know</p>

<p>We will extenuate rather than enforce.</p>

<p>If you apply yourself to our intents,</p>

<p>Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find</p>

<p>A benefit in this change; but if you seek</p>

<p>To lay on me a cruelty by taking</p>

<p>Antony’s course, you shall bereave yourself</p>

<p>Of my good purposes, and put your children</p>

<p>To that destruction which I’ll guard them from</p>

<p>If thereon you rely. I’ll take my leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>And may through all the world. ’Tis yours, and we,</p>

<p>Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall</p>

<p>Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[She holds out a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels</p>

<p>I am possessed of. ’Tis exactly valued,</p>

<p>Not petty things admitted.–Where’s Seleucus?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Seleucus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seleucus</sc>  Here, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>This is my treasurer. Let him speak, my lord,</p>

<p>Upon his peril, that I have reserved</p>

<p>To myself nothing.–Speak the truth, Seleucus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seleucus</sc></p>

<p>Madam, I had rather seel my lips</p>

<p>Than to my peril speak that which is not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  What have I kept back?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seleucus</sc></p>

<p>Enough to purchase what you have made known.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>Nay, blush not, Cleopatra. I approve</p>

<p>Your wisdom in the deed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  See, Caesar, O, behold</p>

<p>How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours,</p>

<p>And should we shift estates, yours would be mine.</p>

<p>The ingratitude of this Seleucus does</p>

<p>Even make me wild.–O slave, of no more trust</p>

<p>Than love that’s hired! What, goest thou back? Thou</p>

<p>shalt</p>

<p>Go back, I warrant thee! But I’ll catch thine eyes</p>

<p>Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!</p>

<p>O rarely base!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Good queen, let us entreat you–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,</p>

<p>That thou vouchsafing here to visit me,</p>

<p>Doing the honor of thy lordliness</p>

<p>To one so meek, that mine own servant should</p>

<p>Parcel the sum of my disgraces by</p>

<p>Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,</p>

<p>That I some lady trifles have reserved,</p>

<p>Immoment toys, things of such dignity</p>

<p>As we greet modern friends withal, and say</p>

<p>Some nobler token I have kept apart</p>

<p>For Livia and Octavia, to induce</p>

<p>Their mediation, must I be unfolded</p>

<p>With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me</p>

<p>Beneath the fall I have. <i>[To Seleucus.]</i> Prithee, go</p>

<p>hence,</p>

<p>Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits</p>

<p>Through th’ ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,</p>

<p>Thou wouldst have mercy on me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Forbear, Seleucus.</p>

<p><center><i>[Seleucus exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought</p>

<p>For things that others do; and when we fall,</p>

<p>We answer others’ merits in our name–</p>

<p>Are therefore to be pitied.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Cleopatra,</p>

<p>Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged</p>

<p>Put we i’ th’ roll of conquest. Still be ’t yours!</p>

<p>Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe</p>

<p>Caesar’s no merchant to make prize with you</p>

<p>Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be</p>

<p>cheered.</p>

<p>Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear</p>

<p>queen,</p>

<p>For we intend so to dispose you as</p>

<p>Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.</p>

<p>Our care and pity is so much upon you</p>

<p>That we remain your friend. And so adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>My master and my lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Not so. Adieu.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. Caesar and his train exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not</p>

<p>Be noble to myself. But hark thee, Charmian.</p>

<p><center><i>[She whispers to Charmian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iras</sc></p>

<p>Finish, good lady. The bright day is done,</p>

<p>And we are for the dark.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc> <i>[to Charmian]</i>  Hie thee again.</p>

<p>I have spoke already, and it is provided.</p>

<p>Go put it to the haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  Madam, I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dolabella.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc></p>

<p>Where’s the Queen?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  Behold, sir.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Dolabella.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc></p>

<p>Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,</p>

<p>Which my love makes religion to obey,</p>

<p>I tell you this: Caesar through Syria</p>

<p>Intends his journey, and within three days</p>

<p>You with your children will he send before.</p>

<p>Make your best use of this. I have performed</p>

<p>Your pleasure and my promise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Dolabella,</p>

<p>I shall remain your debtor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  I your servant.</p>

<p>Adieu, good queen. I must attend on Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, and thanks.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Now, Iras, what think’st thou?</p>

<p>Thou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown</p>

<p>In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves</p>

<p>With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers shall</p>

<p>Uplift us to the view. In their thick breaths,</p>

<p>Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded</p>

<p>And forced to drink their vapor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iras</sc>  The gods forbid!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Nay, ’tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors</p>

<p>Will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers</p>

<p>Ballad us out o’ tune. The quick comedians</p>

<p>Extemporally will stage us and present</p>

<p>Our Alexandrian revels. Antony</p>

<p>Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see</p>

<p>Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness</p>

<p>I’ th’ posture of a whore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iras</sc>  O the good gods!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Nay, that’s certain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iras</sc></p>

<p>I’ll never see ’t! For I am sure mine nails</p>

<p>Are stronger than mine eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Why, that’s the way</p>

<p>To fool their preparation and to conquer</p>

<p>Their most absurd intents.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Charmian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now, Charmian!</p>

<p>Show me, my women, like a queen. Go fetch</p>

<p>My best attires. I am again for Cydnus</p>

<p>To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah Iras, go.–</p>

<p>Now, noble Charmian, we’ll dispatch indeed,</p>

<p>And when thou hast done this chare, I’ll give thee</p>

<p>leave</p>

<p>To play till Doomsday.–Bring our crown and all.</p>

<p><center><i>[Iras exits. A noise within.]</i></center></p>

<p>Wherefore’s this noise?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Guardsman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guardsman</sc>  Here is a rural fellow</p>

<p>That will not be denied your Highness’ presence.</p>

<p>He brings you figs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Let him come in.     <i><i>[Guardsman exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>What poor an instrument</p>

<p>May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.</p>

<p>My resolution’s placed, and I have nothing</p>

<p>Of woman in me. Now from head to foot</p>

<p>I am marble-constant. Now the fleeting moon</p>

<p>No planet is of mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Guardsman and Countryman, with a basket.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guardsman</sc>  This is the man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Avoid, and leave him.     <i><i>[Guardsman exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there</p>

<p>That kills and pains not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countryman</sc>  Truly I have him, but I would not be</p>

<p>the party that should desire you to touch him, for</p>

<p>his biting is immortal. Those that do die of it do</p>

<p>seldom or never recover.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Remember’st thou any that have died on ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countryman</sc>  Very many, men and women too. I</p>

<p>heard of one of them no longer than yesterday–a</p>

<p>very honest woman, but something given to lie, as a</p>

<p>woman should not do but in the way of honesty–</p>

<p>how she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt.</p>

<p>Truly, she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm.</p>

<p>But he that will believe all that they say shall never</p>

<p>be saved by half that they do. But this is most</p>

<p>falliable, the worm’s an odd worm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Get thee hence. Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countryman</sc>  I wish you all joy of the worm.</p>

<p><center><i>[He sets down the basket.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countryman</sc>  You must think this, look you, that the</p>

<p>worm will do his kind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Ay, ay, farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countryman</sc>  Look you, the worm is not to be trusted</p>

<p>but in the keeping of wise people, for indeed there</p>

<p>is no goodness in the worm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countryman</sc>  Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you,</p>

<p>for it is not worth the feeding.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Will it eat me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countryman</sc>  You must not think I am so simple but</p>

<p>I know the devil himself will not eat a woman. I</p>

<p>know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil</p>

<p>dress her not. But truly these same whoreson devils</p>

<p>do the gods great harm in their women, for in every</p>

<p>ten that they make, the devils mar five.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Well, get thee gone. Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Countryman</sc>  Yes, forsooth. I wish you joy o’ th’</p>

<p>worm.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Iras bearing Cleopatra’s royal regalia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Give me my robe. Put on my crown. I have</p>

<p>Immortal longings in me. Now no more</p>

<p>The juice of Egypt’s grape shall moist this lip.</p>

<p><center><i>[Charmian and Iras begin to dress her.]</i></center></p>

<p>Yare, yare, good Iras, quick. Methinks I hear</p>

<p>Antony call. I see him rouse himself</p>

<p>To praise my noble act. I hear him mock</p>

<p>The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men</p>

<p>To excuse their after wrath.–Husband, I come!</p>

<p>Now to that name my courage prove my title.</p>

<p>I am fire and air; my other elements</p>

<p>I give to baser life.–So, have you done?</p>

<p>Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.</p>

<p>Farewell, kind Charmian.–Iras, long farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[She kisses them. Iras falls and dies.]</i></center></p>

<p>Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?</p>

<p>If thou and nature can so gently part,</p>

<p>The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch,</p>

<p>Which hurts and is desired. Dost thou lie still?</p>

<p>If thus thou vanishest, thou tell’st the world</p>

<p>It is not worth leave-taking.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc></p>

<p>Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say</p>

<p>The gods themselves do weep!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  This proves me base.</p>

<p>If she first meet the curled Antony,</p>

<p>He’ll make demand of her, and spend that kiss</p>

<p>Which is my heaven to have.–Come, thou mortal</p>

<p>wretch,     <i><i>[She places an asp on her breast.]</i></i></p>

<p>With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate</p>

<p>Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,</p>

<p>Be angry and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,</p>

<p>That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass</p>

<p>Unpolicied!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  O eastern star!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Peace, peace!</p>

<p>Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,</p>

<p>That sucks the nurse asleep?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  O, break! O, break!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle–</p>

<p>O Antony!–Nay, I will take thee too.</p>

<p><center><i>[She places an asp on her arm.]</i></center></p>

<p>What should I stay–     <i><i>[Dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  In this wild world? So, fare thee well.</p>

<p>Now boast thee, Death, in thy possession lies</p>

<p>A lass unparalleled. Downy windows, close,</p>

<p><center><i>[She closes Cleopatra’s eyes.]</i></center></p>

<p>And golden Phoebus, never be beheld</p>

<p>Of eyes again so royal. Your crown’s awry.</p>

<p>I’ll mend it, and then play–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Guard rustling in.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Guard</sc></p>

<p>Where’s the Queen?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  Speak softly. Wake her not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Guard</sc></p>

<p>Caesar hath sent–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  Too slow a messenger.</p>

<p><center><i>[She takes out an asp.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Guard</sc></p>

<p>Approach, ho! All’s not well. Caesar’s beguiled.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Guard</sc></p>

<p>There’s Dolabella sent from Caesar. Call him.</p>

<p><center><i>[A Guardsman exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Guard</sc></p>

<p>What work is here, Charmian? Is this well done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc></p>

<p>It is well done, and fitting for a princess</p>

<p>Descended of so many royal kings.</p>

<p>Ah, soldier!     <i><i>[Charmian dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dolabella.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc></p>

<p>How goes it here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Guard</sc>  All dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  Caesar, thy thoughts</p>

<p>Touch their effects in this. Thyself art coming</p>

<p>To see performed the dreaded act which thou</p>

<p>So sought’st to hinder.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Caesar and all his train, marching.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  A way there, a way for Caesar!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc></p>

<p>O sir, you are too sure an augurer:</p>

<p>That you did fear is done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Bravest at the last,</p>

<p>She leveled at our purposes and, being royal,</p>

<p>Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?</p>

<p>I do not see them bleed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  Who was last with them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Guard</sc></p>

<p>A simple countryman that brought her figs.</p>

<p>This was his basket.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Poisoned, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Guard</sc>  O Caesar,</p>

<p>This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake.</p>

<p>I found her trimming up the diadem</p>

<p>On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,</p>

<p>And on the sudden dropped.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  O, noble weakness!</p>

<p>If they had swallowed poison, ’twould appear</p>

<p>By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,</p>

<p>As she would catch another Antony</p>

<p>In her strong toil of grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  Here on her breast</p>

<p>There is a vent of blood, and something blown.</p>

<p>The like is on her arm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Guard</sc></p>

<p>This is an aspic’s trail, and these fig leaves</p>

<p>Have slime upon them, such as th’ aspic leaves</p>

<p>Upon the caves of Nile.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Most probable</p>

<p>That so she died, for her physician tells me</p>

<p>She hath pursued conclusions infinite</p>

<p>Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,</p>

<p>And bear her women from the monument.</p>

<p>She shall be buried by her Antony.</p>

<p>No grave upon the earth shall clip in it</p>

<p>A pair so famous. High events as these</p>

<p>Strike those that make them; and their story is</p>

<p>No less in pity than his glory which</p>

<p>Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall</p>

<p>In solemn show attend this funeral,</p>

<p>And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see</p>

<p>High order in this great solemnity.</p>
