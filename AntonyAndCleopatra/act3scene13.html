<p><center><i>[Enter Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian, and Iras.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>What shall we do, Enobarbus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  Think, and die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Is Antony or we in fault for this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc></p>

<p>Antony only, that would make his will</p>

<p>Lord of his reason. What though you fled</p>

<p>From that great face of war, whose several ranges</p>

<p>Frighted each other? Why should he follow?</p>

<p>The itch of his affection should not then</p>

<p>Have nicked his captainship, at such a point,</p>

<p>When half to half the world opposed, he being</p>

<p>The mered question. ’Twas a shame no less</p>

<p>Than was his loss, to course your flying flags</p>

<p>And leave his navy gazing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Prithee, peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Ambassador with Antony.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Is that his answer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ambassador</sc>  Ay, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she</p>

<p>Will yield us up?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ambassador</sc>  He says so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Let her know ’t.–</p>

<p>To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,</p>

<p>And he will fill thy wishes to the brim</p>

<p>With principalities.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  That head, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc> <i>[to Ambassador]</i></p>

<p>To him again. Tell him he wears the rose</p>

<p>Of youth upon him, from which the world should</p>

<p>note</p>

<p>Something particular: his coin, ships, legions</p>

<p>May be a coward’s, whose ministers would prevail</p>

<p>Under the service of a child as soon</p>

<p>As i’ th’ command of Caesar. I dare him therefore</p>

<p>To lay his gay caparisons apart</p>

<p>And answer me declined, sword against sword,</p>

<p>Ourselves alone. I’ll write it. Follow me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Antony and Ambassador exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will</p>

<p>Unstate his happiness and be staged to th’ show</p>

<p>Against a sworder! I see men’s judgments are</p>

<p>A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward</p>

<p>Do draw the inward quality after them</p>

<p>To suffer all alike. That he should dream,</p>

<p>Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will</p>

<p>Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued</p>

<p>His judgment too.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  A messenger from Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>What, no more ceremony? See, my women,</p>

<p>Against the blown rose may they stop their nose</p>

<p>That kneeled unto the buds.–Admit him, sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[Servant exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Mine honesty and I begin to square.</p>

<p>The loyalty well held to fools does make</p>

<p>Our faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure</p>

<p>To follow with allegiance a fall’n lord</p>

<p>Does conquer him that did his master conquer,</p>

<p>And earns a place i’ th’ story.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Thidias.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Caesar’s will?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thidias</sc></p>

<p>Hear it apart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  None but friends. Say boldly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thidias</sc></p>

<p>So haply are they friends to Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc></p>

<p>He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,</p>

<p>Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master</p>

<p>Will leap to be his friend. For us, you know</p>

<p>Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thidias</sc>  So.–</p>

<p>Thus then, thou most renowned: Caesar entreats</p>

<p>Not to consider in what case thou stand’st</p>

<p>Further than he is Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Go on; right royal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thidias</sc></p>

<p>He knows that you embrace not Antony</p>

<p>As you did love, but as you feared him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  O!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thidias</sc></p>

<p>The scars upon your honor therefore he</p>

<p>Does pity as constrained blemishes,</p>

<p>Not as deserved.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  He is a god and knows</p>

<p>What is most right. Mine honor was not yielded,</p>

<p>But conquered merely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  To be sure of that,</p>

<p>I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky</p>

<p>That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for</p>

<p>Thy dearest quit thee.     <i><i>[Enobarbus exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thidias</sc>  Shall I say to Caesar</p>

<p>What you require of him? For he partly begs</p>

<p>To be desired to give. It much would please him</p>

<p>That of his fortunes you should make a staff</p>

<p>To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits</p>

<p>To hear from me you had left Antony</p>

<p>And put yourself under his shroud,</p>

<p>The universal landlord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  What’s your name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thidias</sc></p>

<p>My name is Thidias.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Most kind messenger,</p>

<p>Say to great Caesar this in deputation:</p>

<p>I kiss his conqu’ring hand. Tell him I am prompt</p>

<p>To lay my crown at ’s feet, and there to kneel.</p>

<p>Tell him, from his all-obeying breath I hear</p>

<p>The doom of Egypt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thidias</sc>  ’Tis your noblest course.</p>

<p>Wisdom and fortune combating together,</p>

<p>If that the former dare but what it can,</p>

<p>No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay</p>

<p>My duty on your hand.</p>

<p><center><i>[She gives him her hand to kiss.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Your Caesar’s father oft,</p>

<p>When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,</p>

<p>Bestowed his lips on that unworthy place</p>

<p>As it rained kisses.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antony and Enobarbus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Favors? By Jove that thunders!</p>

<p>What art thou, fellow?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thidias</sc>  One that but performs</p>

<p>The bidding of the fullest man and worthiest</p>

<p>To have command obeyed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc>  You will be whipped.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc> <i>[calling for Servants]</i></p>

<p>Approach there!–Ah, you kite!–Now, gods and</p>

<p>devils,</p>

<p>Authority melts from me. Of late when I cried “Ho!”</p>

<p>Like boys unto a muss kings would start forth</p>

<p>And cry “Your will?” Have you no ears? I am</p>

<p>Antony yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Take hence this jack and whip him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>’Tis better playing with a lion’s whelp</p>

<p>Than with an old one dying.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Moon and stars!</p>

<p>Whip him! Were ’t twenty of the greatest tributaries</p>

<p>That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them</p>

<p>So saucy with the hand of she here–what’s her</p>

<p>name</p>

<p>Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,</p>

<p>Till like a boy you see him cringe his face</p>

<p>And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thidias</sc></p>

<p>Mark Antony–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Tug him away. Being whipped,</p>

<p>Bring him again. This jack of Caesar’s shall</p>

<p>Bear us an errand to him.</p>

<p><center><i>[Servants exit with Thidias.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Cleopatra.]</i> You were half blasted ere I knew you.</p>

<p>Ha!</p>

<p>Have I my pillow left unpressed in Rome,</p>

<p>Forborne the getting of a lawful race,</p>

<p>And by a gem of women, to be abused</p>

<p>By one that looks on feeders?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Good my lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  You have been a boggler ever.</p>

<p>But when we in our viciousness grow hard–</p>

<p>O, misery on ’t!–the wise gods seel our eyes,</p>

<p>In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us</p>

<p>Adore our errors, laugh at ’s while we strut</p>

<p>To our confusion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  O, is ’t come to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>I found you as a morsel cold upon</p>

<p>Dead Caesar’s trencher; nay, you were a fragment</p>

<p>Of Gneius Pompey’s, besides what hotter hours,</p>

<p>Unregistered in vulgar fame, you have</p>

<p>Luxuriously picked out. For I am sure,</p>

<p>Though you can guess what temperance should be,</p>

<p>You know not what it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Wherefore is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>To let a fellow that will take rewards</p>

<p>And say “God quit you!” be familiar with</p>

<p>My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal</p>

<p>And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were</p>

<p>Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar</p>

<p>The horned herd! For I have savage cause,</p>

<p>And to proclaim it civilly were like</p>

<p>A haltered neck which does the hangman thank</p>

<p>For being yare about him.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant with Thidias.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Is he whipped?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  Soundly, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Cried he? And begged he pardon?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  He did ask favor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc> <i>[to Thidias]</i></p>

<p>If that thy father live, let him repent</p>

<p>Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry</p>

<p>To follow Caesar in his triumph, since</p>

<p>Thou hast been whipped for following him.</p>

<p>Henceforth</p>

<p>The white hand of a lady fever thee;</p>

<p>Shake thou to look on ’t. Get thee back to Caesar.</p>

<p>Tell him thy entertainment. Look thou say</p>

<p>He makes me angry with him; for he seems</p>

<p>Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,</p>

<p>Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry,</p>

<p>And at this time most easy ’tis to do ’t,</p>

<p>When my good stars that were my former guides</p>

<p>Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires</p>

<p>Into th’ abysm of hell. If he mislike</p>

<p>My speech and what is done, tell him he has</p>

<p>Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom</p>

<p>He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,</p>

<p>As he shall like to quit me. Urge it thou.</p>

<p>Hence with thy stripes, begone!     <i><i>[Thidias exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Have you done yet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Alack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed,</p>

<p>And it portends alone the fall of Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  I must stay his time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes</p>

<p>With one that ties his points?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Not know me yet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Coldhearted toward me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Ah, dear, if I be so,</p>

<p>From my cold heart let heaven engender hail</p>

<p>And poison it in the source, and the first stone</p>

<p>Drop in my neck; as it determines, so</p>

<p>Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite,</p>

<p>Till by degrees the memory of my womb,</p>

<p>Together with my brave Egyptians all,</p>

<p>By the discandying of this pelleted storm</p>

<p>Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile</p>

<p>Have buried them for prey!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  I am satisfied.</p>

<p>Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where</p>

<p>I will oppose his fate. Our force by land</p>

<p>Hath nobly held; our severed navy too</p>

<p>Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sealike.</p>

<p>Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear,</p>

<p>lady?</p>

<p>If from the field I shall return once more</p>

<p>To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.</p>

<p>I and my sword will earn our chronicle.</p>

<p>There’s hope in ’t yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  That’s my brave lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>I will be treble-sinewed, -hearted, -breathed,</p>

<p>And fight maliciously; for when mine hours</p>

<p>Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives</p>

<p>Of me for jests. But now I’ll set my teeth</p>

<p>And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,</p>

<p>Let’s have one other gaudy night. Call to me</p>

<p>All my sad captains. Fill our bowls once more.</p>

<p>Let’s mock the midnight bell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  It is my birthday.</p>

<p>I had thought t’ have held it poor. But since my lord</p>

<p>Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  We will yet do well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Call all his noble captains to my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Do so; we’ll speak to them, and tonight I’ll force</p>

<p>The wine peep through their scars.–Come on, my</p>

<p>queen,</p>

<p>There’s sap in ’t yet. The next time I do fight</p>

<p>I’ll make Death love me, for I will contend</p>

<p>Even with his pestilent scythe.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Enobarbus exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Enobarbus</sc></p>

<p>Now he’ll outstare the lightning. To be furious</p>

<p>Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood</p>

<p>The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still</p>

<p>A diminution in our captain’s brain</p>

<p>Restores his heart. When valor preys on reason,</p>

<p>It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek</p>

<p>Some way to leave him.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
