<p><center><i>[Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Alexas, and Iras.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Where is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  I did not see him since.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc> <i>[to Alexas]</i></p>

<p>See where he is, who’s with him, what he does.</p>

<p>I did not send you. If you find him sad,</p>

<p>Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report</p>

<p>That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.</p>

<p><center><i>[Alexas exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc></p>

<p>Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,</p>

<p>You do not hold the method to enforce</p>

<p>The like from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  What should I do I do not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc></p>

<p>In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Thou teachest like a fool: the way to lose him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc></p>

<p>Tempt him not so too far. I wish, forbear.</p>

<p>In time we hate that which we often fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antony.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But here comes Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  I am sick and sullen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Help me away, dear Charmian! I shall fall.</p>

<p>It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature</p>

<p>Will not sustain it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Now, my dearest queen–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Pray you stand farther from me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>I know by that same eye there’s some good news.</p>

<p>What, says the married woman you may go?</p>

<p>Would she had never given you leave to come.</p>

<p>Let her not say ’tis I that keep you here.</p>

<p>I have no power upon you. Hers you are.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>The gods best know–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  O, never was there queen</p>

<p>So mightily betrayed! Yet at the first</p>

<p>I saw the treasons planted.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Cleopatra–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Why should I think you can be mine, and true–</p>

<p>Though you in swearing shake the throned gods–</p>

<p>Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,</p>

<p>To be entangled with those mouth-made vows</p>

<p>Which break themselves in swearing!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Most sweet</p>

<p>queen–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Nay, pray you seek no color for your going,</p>

<p>But bid farewell and go. When you sued staying,</p>

<p>Then was the time for words. No going then!</p>

<p>Eternity was in our lips and eyes,</p>

<p>Bliss in our brows’ bent; none our parts so poor</p>

<p>But was a race of heaven. They are so still,</p>

<p>Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,</p>

<p>Art turned the greatest liar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  How now, lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know</p>

<p>There were a heart in Egypt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Hear me, queen:</p>

<p>The strong necessity of time commands</p>

<p>Our services awhile, but my full heart</p>

<p>Remains in use with you. Our Italy</p>

<p>Shines o’er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius</p>

<p>Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;</p>

<p>Equality of two domestic powers</p>

<p>Breed scrupulous faction; the hated grown to</p>

<p>strength</p>

<p>Are newly grown to love; the condemned Pompey,</p>

<p>Rich in his father’s honor, creeps apace</p>

<p>Into the hearts of such as have not thrived</p>

<p>Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;</p>

<p>And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge</p>

<p>By any desperate change. My more particular,</p>

<p>And that which most with you should safe my going,</p>

<p>Is Fulvia’s death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Though age from folly could not give me freedom,</p>

<p>It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  She’s dead, my queen.     <i><i>[He shows her papers.]</i></i></p>

<p>Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read</p>

<p>The garboils she awaked; at the last, best,</p>

<p>See when and where she died.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  O, most false love!</p>

<p>Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill</p>

<p>With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,</p>

<p>In Fulvia’s death, how mine received shall be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know</p>

<p>The purposes I bear, which are or cease</p>

<p>As you shall give th’ advice. By the fire</p>

<p>That quickens Nilus’ slime, I go from hence</p>

<p>Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war</p>

<p>As thou affects.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Cut my lace, Charmian, come!</p>

<p>But let it be; I am quickly ill and well;</p>

<p>So Antony loves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  My precious queen, forbear,</p>

<p>And give true evidence to his love, which stands</p>

<p>An honorable trial.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  So Fulvia told me.</p>

<p>I prithee turn aside and weep for her,</p>

<p>Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears</p>

<p>Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene</p>

<p>Of excellent dissembling, and let it look</p>

<p>Like perfect honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  You’ll heat my blood. No more!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>You can do better yet, but this is meetly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Now by my sword–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  And target. Still he mends.</p>

<p>But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,</p>

<p>How this Herculean Roman does become</p>

<p>The carriage of his chafe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  I’ll leave you, lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Courteous lord, one word.</p>

<p>Sir, you and I must part, but that’s not it;</p>

<p>Sir, you and I have loved, but there’s not it;</p>

<p>That you know well. Something it is I would–</p>

<p>O, my oblivion is a very Antony,</p>

<p>And I am all forgotten.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  But that your Royalty</p>

<p>Holds idleness your subject, I should take you</p>

<p>For idleness itself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  ’Tis sweating labor</p>

<p>To bear such idleness so near the heart</p>

<p>As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me,</p>

<p>Since my becomings kill me when they do not</p>

<p>Eye well to you. Your honor calls you hence;</p>

<p>Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,</p>

<p>And all the gods go with you. Upon your sword</p>

<p>Sit laurel victory, and smooth success</p>

<p>Be strewed before your feet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Let us go. Come.</p>

<p>Our separation so abides and flies</p>

<p>That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,</p>

<p>And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.</p>

<p>Away!</p>
