<p><center><i>[Enter Pompey, Menecrates, and Menas,</p>

<p>in warlike manner.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc></p>

<p>If the great gods be just, they shall assist</p>

<p>The deeds of justest men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menas</sc>  Know, worthy Pompey,</p>

<p>That what they do delay they not deny.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc></p>

<p>Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays</p>

<p>The thing we sue for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menas</sc>  We, ignorant of ourselves,</p>

<p>Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers</p>

<p>Deny us for our good; so find we profit</p>

<p>By losing of our prayers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  I shall do well.</p>

<p>The people love me, and the sea is mine;</p>

<p>My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope</p>

<p>Says it will come to th’ full. Mark Antony</p>

<p>In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make</p>

<p>No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where</p>

<p>He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,</p>

<p>Of both is flattered; but he neither loves,</p>

<p>Nor either cares for him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menas</sc>  Caesar and Lepidus</p>

<p>Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc></p>

<p>Where have you this? ’Tis false.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menas</sc>  From Silvius, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc></p>

<p>He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,</p>

<p>Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,</p>

<p>Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wanned lip!</p>

<p>Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;</p>

<p>Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts;</p>

<p>Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks</p>

<p>Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,</p>

<p>That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honor</p>

<p>Even till a Lethe’d dullness–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Varrius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Varrius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Varrius</sc></p>

<p>This is most certain that I shall deliver:</p>

<p>Mark Antony is every hour in Rome</p>

<p>Expected. Since he went from Egypt ’tis</p>

<p>A space for farther travel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  I could have given less matter</p>

<p>A better ear.–Menas, I did not think</p>

<p>This amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm</p>

<p>For such a petty war. His soldiership</p>

<p>Is twice the other twain. But let us rear</p>

<p>The higher our opinion, that our stirring</p>

<p>Can from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluck</p>

<p>The ne’er lust-wearied Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menas</sc>  I cannot hope</p>

<p>Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.</p>

<p>His wife that’s dead did trespasses to Caesar;</p>

<p>His brother warred upon him, although I think</p>

<p>Not moved by Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  I know not, Menas,</p>

<p>How lesser enmities may give way to greater.</p>

<p>Were ’t not that we stand up against them all,</p>

<p>’Twere pregnant they should square between</p>

<p>themselves,</p>

<p>For they have entertained cause enough</p>

<p>To draw their swords. But how the fear of us</p>

<p>May cement their divisions and bind up</p>

<p>The petty difference, we yet not know.</p>

<p>Be ’t as our gods will have ’t. It only stands</p>

<p>Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.</p>

<p>Come, Menas.</p>
