<p><center><i>[Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Mardian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Charmian!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  Madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Ha, ha! Give me to drink mandragora.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  Why, madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>That I might sleep out this great gap of time</p>

<p>My Antony is away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  You think of him too much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>O, ’tis treason!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  Madam, I trust not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Thou, eunuch Mardian!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mardian</sc>  What’s your Highness’ pleasure?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Not now to hear thee sing. I take no pleasure</p>

<p>In aught an eunuch has. ’Tis well for thee</p>

<p>That, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts</p>

<p>May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mardian</sc>  Yes, gracious madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Indeed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mardian</sc></p>

<p>Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing</p>

<p>But what indeed is honest to be done.</p>

<p>Yet have I fierce affections, and think</p>

<p>What Venus did with Mars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  O, Charmian,</p>

<p>Where think’st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?</p>

<p>Or does he walk? Or is he on his horse?</p>

<p>O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!</p>

<p>Do bravely, horse, for wot’st thou whom thou</p>

<p>mov’st?</p>

<p>The demi-Atlas of this Earth, the arm</p>

<p>And burgonet of men. He’s speaking now,</p>

<p>Or murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?”</p>

<p>For so he calls me. Now I feed myself</p>

<p>With most delicious poison. Think on me</p>

<p>That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black,</p>

<p>And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,</p>

<p>When thou wast here above the ground, I was</p>

<p>A morsel for a monarch. And great Pompey</p>

<p>Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;</p>

<p>There would he anchor his aspect, and die</p>

<p>With looking on his life.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Alexas from Antony.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexas</sc>  Sovereign of Egypt, hail!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!</p>

<p>Yet coming from him, that great med’cine hath</p>

<p>With his tinct gilded thee.</p>

<p>How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexas</sc>  Last thing he did, dear queen,</p>

<p>He kissed–the last of many doubled kisses–</p>

<p>This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Mine ear must pluck it thence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexas</sc>  “Good friend,” quoth</p>

<p>he,</p>

<p>“Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends</p>

<p>This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,</p>

<p>To mend the petty present, I will piece</p>

<p>Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,</p>

<p>Say thou, shall call her mistress.” So he nodded</p>

<p>And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,</p>

<p>Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke</p>

<p>Was beastly dumbed by him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  What, was he sad, or merry?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexas</sc></p>

<p>Like to the time o’ th’ year between th’ extremes</p>

<p>Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>O, well-divided disposition!–Note him,</p>

<p>Note him, good Charmian, ’tis the man! But note</p>

<p>him:</p>

<p>He was not sad, for he would shine on those</p>

<p>That make their looks by his; he was not merry,</p>

<p>Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay</p>

<p>In Egypt with his joy; but between both.</p>

<p>O, heavenly mingle!–Be’st thou sad or merry,</p>

<p>The violence of either thee becomes,</p>

<p>So does it no man’s else.–Met’st thou my posts?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexas</sc></p>

<p>Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.</p>

<p>Why do you send so thick?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Who’s born that day</p>

<p>When I forget to send to Antony</p>

<p>Shall die a beggar.–Ink and paper, Charmian.–</p>

<p>Welcome, my good Alexas.–Did I, Charmian,</p>

<p>Ever love Caesar so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  O, that brave Caesar!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Be choked with such another emphasis!</p>

<p>Say “the brave Antony.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  The valiant Caesar!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth</p>

<p>If thou with Caesar paragon again</p>

<p>My man of men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  By your most gracious pardon,</p>

<p>I sing but after you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  My salad days,</p>

<p>When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,</p>

<p>To say as I said then. But come, away,</p>

<p>Get me ink and paper.</p>

<p>He shall have every day a several greeting,</p>

<p>Or I’ll unpeople Egypt.</p>
