<p><center><i>[Enter Caesar, Agrippa, Thidias, and</p>

<p>Dolabella, with others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>Let him appear that’s come from Antony.</p>

<p>Know you him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dolabella</sc>  Caesar, ’tis his schoolmaster–</p>

<p>An argument that he is plucked, when hither</p>

<p>He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,</p>

<p>Which had superfluous kings for messengers</p>

<p>Not many moons gone by.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ambassador from Antony.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Approach, and speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ambassador</sc></p>

<p>Such as I am, I come from Antony.</p>

<p>I was of late as petty to his ends</p>

<p>As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf</p>

<p>To his grand sea.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Be ’t so. Declare thine office.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ambassador</sc></p>

<p>Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and</p>

<p>Requires to live in Egypt, which not granted,</p>

<p>He lessens his requests, and to thee sues</p>

<p>To let him breathe between the heavens and Earth,</p>

<p>A private man in Athens. This for him.</p>

<p>Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,</p>

<p>Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves</p>

<p>The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,</p>

<p>Now hazarded to thy grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  For Antony,</p>

<p>I have no ears to his request. The Queen</p>

<p>Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she</p>

<p>From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,</p>

<p>Or take his life there. This if she perform,</p>

<p>She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ambassador</sc></p>

<p>Fortune pursue thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Bring him through the bands.</p>

<p><center><i>[Ambassador exits, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Thidias.]</i> To try thy eloquence now ’tis time.</p>

<p>Dispatch.</p>

<p>From Antony win Cleopatra. Promise,</p>

<p>And in our name, what she requires; add more,</p>

<p>From thine invention, offers. Women are not</p>

<p>In their best fortunes strong, but want will perjure</p>

<p>The ne’er-touched vestal. Try thy cunning, Thidias.</p>

<p>Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we</p>

<p>Will answer as a law.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thidias</sc>  Caesar, I go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,</p>

<p>And what thou think’st his very action speaks</p>

<p>In every power that moves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thidias</sc>  Caesar, I shall.</p>
