<p><center><i>[Enter Antony with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Hark, the land bids me tread no more upon ’t.</p>

<p>It is ashamed to bear me. Friends, come hither.</p>

<p>I am so lated in the world that I</p>

<p>Have lost my way forever. I have a ship</p>

<p>Laden with gold. Take that, divide it. Fly,</p>

<p>And make your peace with Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Fly? Not we!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>I have fled myself and have instructed cowards</p>

<p>To run and show their shoulders. Friends, begone.</p>

<p>I have myself resolved upon a course</p>

<p>Which has no need of you. Begone.</p>

<p>My treasure’s in the harbor; take it. O,</p>

<p>I followed that I blush to look upon!</p>

<p>My very hairs do mutiny, for the white</p>

<p>Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them</p>

<p>For fear and doting. Friends, begone. You shall</p>

<p>Have letters from me to some friends that will</p>

<p>Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,</p>

<p>Nor make replies of loathness. Take the hint</p>

<p>Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left</p>

<p>Which leaves itself. To the seaside straightway!</p>

<p>I will possess you of that ship and treasure.</p>

<p>Leave me, I pray, a little–pray you, now,</p>

<p>Nay, do so–for indeed I have lost command.</p>

<p>Therefore I pray you–I’ll see you by and by.</p>

<p><center><i>[Attendants move aside. Antony sits down.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cleopatra led by Charmian, Iras, and Eros.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Eros</sc></p>

<p>Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iras</sc>  Do, most dear queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  Do! Why, what else?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Let me sit down. O Juno!     <i><i>[She sits down.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  No, no, no, no, no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Eros</sc>  See you here, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Oh fie, fie, fie!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charmian</sc>  Madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iras</sc>  Madam, O good empress!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Eros</sc>  Sir, sir–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept</p>

<p>His sword e’en like a dancer, while I struck</p>

<p>The lean and wrinkled Cassius, and ’twas I</p>

<p>That the mad Brutus ended. He alone</p>

<p>Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had</p>

<p>In the brave squares of war, yet now–no matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc></p>

<p>Ah, stand by.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Eros</sc>  The Queen, my lord, the Queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iras</sc></p>

<p>Go to him, madam; speak to him.</p>

<p>He’s unqualitied with very shame.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc> <i>[rising]</i>  Well, then, sustain me. O!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Eros</sc></p>

<p>Most noble sir, arise. The Queen approaches.</p>

<p>Her head’s declined, and death will seize her but</p>

<p>Your comfort makes the rescue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  I have offended reputation,</p>

<p>A most unnoble swerving.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Eros</sc>  Sir, the Queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc> <i>[rising]</i></p>

<p>O, whither hast them led me, Egypt? See</p>

<p>How I convey my shame out of thine eyes,</p>

<p>By looking back what I have left behind</p>

<p>’Stroyed in dishonor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  O, my lord, my lord,</p>

<p>Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought</p>

<p>You would have followed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Egypt, thou knew’st too well</p>

<p>My heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings,</p>

<p>And thou shouldst tow me after. O’er my spirit</p>

<p>Thy full supremacy thou knew’st, and that</p>

<p>Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods</p>

<p>Command me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  O, my pardon!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Now I must</p>

<p>To the young man send humble treaties, dodge</p>

<p>And palter in the shifts of lowness, who</p>

<p>With half the bulk o’ th’ world played as I pleased,</p>

<p>Making and marring fortunes. You did know</p>

<p>How much you were my conqueror, and that</p>

<p>My sword, made weak by my affection, would</p>

<p>Obey it on all cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleopatra</sc>  Pardon, pardon!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates</p>

<p>All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss.     <i><i>[They kiss.]</i></i></p>

<p>Even this repays me.–</p>

<p>We sent our schoolmaster. Is he come back?–</p>

<p>Love, I am full of lead.–Some wine</p>

<p>Within there, and our viands! Fortune knows</p>

<p>We scorn her most when most she offers blows.</p>
