<p><center><i>[Enter Hostess Quickly of the tavern with two Officers,</p>

<p>Fang and Snare, who lags behind.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Master Fang, have you entered the action?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fang</sc>  It is entered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Where’s your yeoman? Is ’t a lusty yeoman?</p>

<p>Will he stand to ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fang</sc> <i>[calling]</i>  Sirrah! Where’s Snare?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  O Lord, ay, good Master Snare.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snare</sc> <i>[catching up to them]</i>  Here, here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fang</sc>  Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Yea, good Master Snare, I have entered him</p>

<p>and all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snare</sc>  It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he</p>

<p>will stab.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Alas the day, take heed of him. He stabbed me</p>

<p>in mine own house, and that most beastly, in good</p>

<p>faith. He cares not what mischief he does. If his</p>

<p>weapon be out, he will foin like any devil. He will</p>

<p>spare neither man, woman, nor child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fang</sc>  If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  No, nor I neither. I’ll be at your elbow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fang</sc>  An I but fist him once, an he come but within my</p>

<p>view–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  I am undone by his going. I warrant you, he’s</p>

<p>an infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master</p>

<p>Fang, hold him sure. Good Master Snare, let him</p>

<p>not ’scape. He comes continuantly to Pie Corner,</p>

<p>saving your manhoods, to buy a saddle, and he is</p>

<p>indited to dinner to the Lubber’s Head in Lumbert</p>

<p>Street, to Master Smooth’s the silkman. I pray you,</p>

<p>since my exion is entered, and my case so openly</p>

<p>known to the world, let him be brought in to his</p>

<p>answer. A hundred mark is a long one for a poor</p>

<p>lone woman to bear, and I have borne, and borne,</p>

<p>and borne, and have been fubbed off, and fubbed</p>

<p>off, and fubbed off from this day to that day, that it is</p>

<p>a shame to be thought on. There is no honesty in</p>

<p>such dealing, unless a woman should be made an</p>

<p>ass and a beast to bear every knave’s wrong. Yonder</p>

<p>he comes, and that arrant malmsey-nose knave,</p>

<p>Bardolph, with him. Do your offices, do your offices,</p>

<p>Master Fang and Master Snare, do me, do me,</p>

<p>do me your offices.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff and Bardolph, and the Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  How now, whose mare’s dead? What’s the</p>

<p>matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fang</sc>  Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress</p>

<p>Quickly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Away, varlets!–Draw, Bardolph. Cut me off</p>

<p>the villain’s head. Throw the quean in the</p>

<p>channel.     <i><i>[They draw.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Throw me in the channel? I’ll throw thee in</p>

<p>the channel. Wilt thou, wilt thou, thou bastardly</p>

<p>rogue?–Murder, murder!–Ah, thou honeysuckle</p>

<p>villain, wilt thou kill God’s officers and the King’s?</p>

<p>Ah, thou honeyseed rogue, thou art a honeyseed, a</p>

<p>man-queller, and a woman-queller.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Keep them off, Bardolph.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Officers</sc>  A rescue, a rescue!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Good people, bring a rescue or two.–Thou</p>

<p>wot, wot thou? Thou wot, wot ta? Do, do, thou</p>

<p>rogue. Do, thou hempseed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Away, you scullion, you rampallian, you fustilarian!</p>

<p>I’ll tickle your catastrophe.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Chief Justice and his Men.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc></p>

<p>What is the matter? Keep the peace here, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you</p>

<p>stand to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc></p>

<p>How now, Sir John? What, are you brawling here?</p>

<p>Doth this become your place, your time, and</p>

<p>business?</p>

<p>You should have been well on your way to York.–</p>

<p>Stand from him, fellow. Wherefore hang’st thou</p>

<p>upon him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  O my most worshipful lord, an ’t please your</p>

<p>Grace, I am a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is</p>

<p>arrested at my suit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  For what sum?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all I</p>

<p>have. He hath eaten me out of house and home. He</p>

<p>hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his.</p>

<p><i>[To Falstaff.]</i> But I will have some of it out again, or I</p>

<p>will ride thee o’ nights like the mare.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I think I am as like to ride the mare if I have</p>

<p>any vantage of ground to get up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  How comes this, Sir John? Fie, what</p>

<p>man of good temper would endure this tempest of</p>

<p>exclamation? Are you not ashamed to enforce a</p>

<p>poor widow to so rough a course to come by her</p>

<p>own?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What is the gross sum that I owe thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself</p>

<p>and the money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a</p>

<p>parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin chamber at</p>

<p>the round table by a sea-coal fire, upon Wednesday</p>

<p>in Wheeson week, when the Prince broke thy head</p>

<p>for liking his father to a singing-man of Windsor,</p>

<p>thou didst swear to me then, as I was washing thy</p>

<p>wound, to marry me and make me my lady thy wife.</p>

<p>Canst thou deny it? Did not Goodwife Keech, the</p>

<p>butcher’s wife, come in then and call me Gossip</p>

<p>Quickly, coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar,</p>

<p>telling us she had a good dish of prawns, whereby</p>

<p>thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told thee</p>

<p>they were ill for a green wound? And didst thou not,</p>

<p>when she was gone downstairs, desire me to be no</p>

<p>more so familiarity with such poor people, saying</p>

<p>that ere long they should call me madam? And didst</p>

<p>thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty</p>

<p>shillings? I put thee now to thy book-oath. Deny it if</p>

<p>thou canst.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  My lord, this is a poor mad soul, and she says</p>

<p>up and down the town that her eldest son is like</p>

<p>you. She hath been in good case, and the truth is,</p>

<p>poverty hath distracted her. But, for these foolish</p>

<p>officers, I beseech you I may have redress against</p>

<p>them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted</p>

<p>with your manner of wrenching the true cause the</p>

<p>false way. It is not a confident brow, nor the throng</p>

<p>of words that come with such more than impudent</p>

<p>sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level</p>

<p>consideration. You have, as it appears to me, practiced</p>

<p>upon the easy-yielding spirit of this woman,</p>

<p>and made her serve your uses both in purse and in</p>

<p>person.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Yea, in truth, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Pray thee, peace.–Pay her the debt you</p>

<p>owe her, and unpay the villainy you have done with</p>

<p>her. The one you may do with sterling money, and</p>

<p>the other with current repentance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without</p>

<p>reply. You call honorable boldness “impudent</p>

<p>sauciness.” If a man will make curtsy and say</p>

<p>nothing, he is virtuous. No, my lord, my humble</p>

<p>duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say to</p>

<p>you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,</p>

<p>being upon hasty employment in the King’s affairs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  You speak as having power to do wrong;</p>

<p>but answer in th’ effect of your reputation, and</p>

<p>satisfy the poor woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Come hither, hostess.</p>

<p><center><i>[He speaks aside to the Hostess.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger, Master Gower.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Now, Master Gower, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc></p>

<p>The King, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales</p>

<p>Are near at hand. The rest the paper tells.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives the Chief Justice a paper to read.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[to the Hostess]</i>  As I am a gentleman!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Faith, you said so before.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  As I am a gentleman. Come. No more words</p>

<p>of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be</p>

<p>fain to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my</p>

<p>dining chambers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Glasses, glasses, is the only drinking. And for</p>

<p>thy walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of the</p>

<p>Prodigal or the German hunting in waterwork is</p>

<p>worth a thousand of these bed-hangers and these</p>

<p>fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if thou</p>

<p>canst. Come, an ’twere not for thy humors, there’s</p>

<p>not a better wench in England. Go wash thy face,</p>

<p>and draw the action. Come, thou must not be in this</p>

<p>humor with me. Dost not know me? Come, come. I</p>

<p>know thou wast set on to this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty</p>

<p>nobles. I’ faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God</p>

<p>save me, la.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Let it alone. I’ll make other shift. You’ll be a</p>

<p>fool still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my</p>

<p>gown. I hope you’ll come to supper. You’ll pay</p>

<p>me all together?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Will I live? <i>[Aside to Bardolph.]</i> Go with her,</p>

<p>with her. Hook on, hook on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at</p>

<p>supper?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  No more words. Let’s have her.</p>

<p><center><i>[Hostess, Fang, Snare, Bardolph, Page,</p>

<p>and others exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc> <i>[to Gower]</i>  I have heard better news.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[to Chief Justice]</i>  What’s the news, my good</p>

<p>lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc> <i>[to Gower]</i>  Where lay the King</p>

<p>tonight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  At Basingstoke, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[to Chief Justice]</i>  I hope, my lord, all’s</p>

<p>well. What is the news, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc> <i>[to Gower]</i>  Come all his forces back?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc></p>

<p>No. Fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse</p>

<p>Are marched up to my Lord of Lancaster</p>

<p>Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[to Chief Justice]</i></p>

<p>Comes the King back from Wales, my noble lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc> <i>[to Gower]</i></p>

<p>You shall have letters of me presently.</p>

<p>Come. Go along with me, good Master Gower.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  My lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to</p>

<p>dinner?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  I must wait upon my good lord here. I thank</p>

<p>you, good Sir John.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Sir John, you loiter here too long, being</p>

<p>you are to take soldiers up in counties as you go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Will you sup with me, Master Gower?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  What foolish master taught you these</p>

<p>manners, Sir John?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Master Gower, if they become me not, he was</p>

<p>a fool that taught them me.–This is the right</p>

<p>fencing grace, my lord: tap for tap, and so part fair.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Now the Lord lighten thee. Thou art a</p>

<p>great fool.</p>
