<br/>

<p><sc>Rumor</sc></p>

<p>Open your ears, for which of you will stop</p>

<p>The vent of hearing when loud Rumor speaks?</p>

<p>I, from the orient to the drooping west,</p>

<p>Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold</p>

<p>The acts commenced on this ball of earth.</p>

<p>Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</p>

<p>The which in every language I pronounce,</p>

<p>Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</p>

<p>I speak of peace while covert enmity</p>

<p>Under the smile of safety wounds the world.</p>

<p>And who but Rumor, who but only I,</p>

<p>Make fearful musters and prepared defense</p>

<p>Whiles the big year, swoll’n with some other grief,</p>

<p>Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</p>

<p>And no such matter? Rumor is a pipe</p>

<p>Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,</p>

<p>And of so easy and so plain a stop</p>

<p>That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</p>

<p>The still-discordant wav’ring multitude,</p>

<p>Can play upon it. But what need I thus</p>

<p>My well-known body to anatomize</p>

<p>Among my household? Why is Rumor here?</p>

<p>I run before King Harry’s victory,</p>

<p>Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury</p>

<p>Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</p>

<p>Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</p>

<p>Even with the rebels’ blood. But what mean I</p>

<p>To speak so true at first? My office is</p>

<p>To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</p>

<p>Under the wrath of noble Hotspur’s sword,</p>

<p>And that the King before the Douglas’ rage</p>

<p>Stooped his anointed head as low as death.</p>

<p>This have I rumored through the peasant towns</p>

<p>Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</p>

<p>And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</p>

<p>Where Hotspur’s father, old Northumberland,</p>

<p>Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,</p>

<p>And not a man of them brings other news</p>

<p>Than they have learnt of me. From Rumor’s</p>

<p>tongues</p>

<p>They bring smooth comforts false, worse than</p>

<p>true wrongs.</p>
