<p><center><i>[Enter two Grooms.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Groom</span>  More rushes, more rushes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Groom</span>  The trumpets have sounded twice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Groom</span>  ’Twill be two o’clock ere they come</p>

<p>from the coronation. Dispatch, dispatch.</p>

<p><center><i>[Grooms exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Trumpets sound, and the King and his train pass over</p>

<p>the stage. After them enter Falstaff, Shallow, Pistol,</p>

<p>Bardolph, and the Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow. I</p>

<p>will make the King do you grace. I will leer upon</p>

<p>him as he comes by, and do but mark the countenance</p>

<p>that he will give me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  God bless thy lungs, good knight!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Come here, Pistol, stand behind me.–O, if I</p>

<p>had had time to have made new liveries, I would</p>

<p>have bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of</p>

<p>you. But ’tis no matter. This poor show doth better.</p>

<p>This doth infer the zeal I had to see him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  It doth so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  It shows my earnestness of affection–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  It doth so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  My devotion–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  It doth, it doth, it doth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  As it were, to ride day and night, and not to</p>

<p>deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience</p>

<p>to shift me–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  It is best, certain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  But to stand stained with travel and sweating</p>

<p>with desire to see him, thinking of nothing else,</p>

<p>putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there were</p>

<p>nothing else to be done but to see him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  ’Tis semper idem, for obsque hoc nihil est; ’tis</p>

<p>all in every part.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  ’Tis so indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver, and</p>

<p>make thee rage. Thy Doll and Helen of thy noble</p>

<p>thoughts is in base durance and contagious prison,</p>

<p>haled thither by most mechanical and dirty hand.</p>

<p>Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell Alecto’s</p>

<p>snake, for Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  I will deliver her.</p>

<p><center><i>[Shouts within. The trumpets sound.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span></p>

<p>There roared the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the King and his train.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span></p>

<p>God save thy Grace, King Hal, my royal Hal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span></p>

<p>The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal</p>

<p>imp of fame!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  God save thee, my sweet boy!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>My Lord Chief Justice, speak to that vain man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chief</span> <span class='sc'>Justice</span> <i>[to Falstaff]</i></p>

<p>Have you your wits? Know you what ’tis you</p>

<p>speak?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span> <i>[to the King]</i></p>

<p>My king, my Jove, I speak to thee, my heart!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>I know thee not, old man. Fall to thy prayers.</p>

<p>How ill white hairs becomes a fool and jester.</p>

<p>I have long dreamt of such a kind of man,</p>

<p>So surfeit-swelled, so old, and so profane;</p>

<p>But being awaked, I do despise my dream.</p>

<p>Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;</p>

<p>Leave gormandizing. Know the grave doth gape</p>

<p>For thee thrice wider than for other men.</p>

<p>Reply not to me with a fool-born jest.</p>

<p>Presume not that I am the thing I was,</p>

<p>For God doth know–so shall the world perceive–</p>

<p>That I have turned away my former self.</p>

<p>So will I those that kept me company.</p>

<p>When thou dost hear I am as I have been,</p>

<p>Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,</p>

<p>The tutor and the feeder of my riots.</p>

<p>Till then I banish thee, on pain of death,</p>

<p>As I have done the rest of my misleaders,</p>

<p>Not to come near our person by ten mile.</p>

<p>For competence of life I will allow you,</p>

<p>That lack of means enforce you not to evils.</p>

<p>And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,</p>

<p>We will, according to your strengths and qualities,</p>

<p>Give you advancement. <i>[To the Lord Chief Justice.]</i></p>

<p>Be it your charge, my lord,</p>

<p>To see performed the tenor of my word.–</p>

<p>Set on.</p>

<p><center><i>[King and his train exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  Yea, marry, Sir John, which I beseech you to</p>

<p>let me have home with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not</p>

<p>you grieve at this. I shall be sent for in private to</p>

<p>him. Look you, he must seem thus to the world.</p>

<p>Fear not your advancements. I will be the man yet</p>

<p>that shall make you great.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  I cannot well perceive how, unless you</p>

<p>should give me your doublet and stuff me out with</p>

<p>straw. I beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five</p>

<p>hundred of my thousand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Sir, I will be as good as my word. This that</p>

<p>you heard was but a color.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  A color that I fear you will die in, Sir John.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  Fear no colors. Go with me to dinner.–</p>

<p>Come, lieutenant Pistol.–Come, Bardolph.–I</p>

<p>shall be sent for soon at night.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Lord Chief Justice and Prince John, with</p>

<p>Officers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chief</span> <span class='sc'>Justice</span></p>

<p>Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet.</p>

<p>Take all his company along with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  My lord, my lord –</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chief</span> <span class='sc'>Justice</span></p>

<p>I cannot now speak. I will hear you soon.–</p>

<p>Take them away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Si fortuna me tormenta, spero me contenta.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but John of Lancaster and</p>

<p>Chief Justice exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>John</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Lancaster</span></p>

<p>I like this fair proceeding of the King’s.</p>

<p>He hath intent his wonted followers</p>

<p>Shall all be very well provided for,</p>

<p>But all are banished till their conversations</p>

<p>Appear more wise and modest to the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chief</span> <span class='sc'>Justice</span>  And so they are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>John</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Lancaster</span></p>

<p>The King hath called his parliament, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chief</span> <span class='sc'>Justice</span>  He hath.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>John</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Lancaster</span></p>

<p>I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,</p>

<p>We bear our civil swords and native fire</p>

<p>As far as France. I heard a bird so sing,</p>

<p>Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the King.</p>

<p>Come, will you hence?</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
