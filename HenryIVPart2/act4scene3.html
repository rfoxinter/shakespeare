<p><center><i>[Enter the King in a chair, Warwick, Thomas Duke of</p>

<p>Clarence, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, and</p>

<p>Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Now, lords, if God doth give successful end</p>

<p>To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,</p>

<p>We will our youth lead on to higher fields</p>

<p>And draw no swords but what are sanctified.</p>

<p>Our navy is addressed, our power collected,</p>

<p>Our substitutes in absence well invested,</p>

<p>And everything lies level to our wish.</p>

<p>Only we want a little personal strength;</p>

<p>And pause us till these rebels now afoot</p>

<p>Come underneath the yoke of government.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Both which we doubt not but your Majesty</p>

<p>Shall soon enjoy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Humphrey, my son of Gloucester, where is the</p>

<p>Prince your brother?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Humphrey</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>I think he’s gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>And how accompanied?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Humphrey</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  I do not know, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Humphrey</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>No, my good lord, he is in presence here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Clarence</span> <i>[coming forward]</i>  What would</p>

<p>my lord and father?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.</p>

<p>How chance thou art not with the Prince thy</p>

<p>brother?</p>

<p>He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas.</p>

<p>Thou hast a better place in his affection</p>

<p>Than all thy brothers. Cherish it, my boy,</p>

<p>And noble offices thou mayst effect</p>

<p>Of mediation, after I am dead,</p>

<p>Between his greatness and thy other brethren.</p>

<p>Therefore omit him not, blunt not his love,</p>

<p>Nor lose the good advantage of his grace</p>

<p>By seeming cold or careless of his will.</p>

<p>For he is gracious if he be observed;</p>

<p>He hath a tear for pity, and a hand</p>

<p>Open as day for melting charity;</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding, being incensed he is flint,</p>

<p>As humorous as winter, and as sudden</p>

<p>As flaws congealed in the spring of day.</p>

<p>His temper therefore must be well observed.</p>

<p>Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,</p>

<p>When you perceive his blood inclined to mirth;</p>

<p>But, being moody, give him time and scope</p>

<p>Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,</p>

<p>Confound themselves with working. Learn this,</p>

<p>Thomas,</p>

<p>And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,</p>

<p>A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,</p>

<p>That the united vessel of their blood,</p>

<p>Mingled with venom of suggestion</p>

<p>(As, force perforce, the age will pour it in),</p>

<p>Shall never leak, though it do work as strong</p>

<p>As aconitum or rash gunpowder.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>I shall observe him with all care and love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>He is not there today; he dines in London.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>And how accompanied? Canst thou tell that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>With Poins and other his continual followers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds,</p>

<p>And he, the noble image of my youth,</p>

<p>Is overspread with them; therefore my grief</p>

<p>Stretches itself beyond the hour of death.</p>

<p>The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape,</p>

<p>In forms imaginary, th’ unguided days</p>

<p>And rotten times that you shall look upon</p>

<p>When I am sleeping with my ancestors.</p>

<p>For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,</p>

<p>When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,</p>

<p>When means and lavish manners meet together,</p>

<p>O, with what wings shall his affections fly</p>

<p>Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite.</p>

<p>The Prince but studies his companions</p>

<p>Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the</p>

<p>language,</p>

<p>’Tis needful that the most immodest word</p>

<p>Be looked upon and learned; which, once attained,</p>

<p>Your Highness knows, comes to no further use</p>

<p>But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,</p>

<p>The Prince will, in the perfectness of time,</p>

<p>Cast off his followers, and their memory</p>

<p>Shall as a pattern or a measure live,</p>

<p>By which his Grace must mete the lives of others,</p>

<p>Turning past evils to advantages.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>’Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb</p>

<p>In the dead carrion.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Westmoreland.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Who’s here? Westmoreland?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>Health to my sovereign, and new happiness</p>

<p>Added to that that I am to deliver.</p>

<p>Prince John your son doth kiss your Grace’s hand.</p>

<p>Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings, and all</p>

<p>Are brought to the correction of your law.</p>

<p>There is not now a rebel’s sword unsheathed,</p>

<p>But peace puts forth her olive everywhere.</p>

<p>The manner how this action hath been borne</p>

<p>Here at more leisure may your Highness read</p>

<p>With every course in his particular.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives the King a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,</p>

<p>Which ever in the haunch of winter sings</p>

<p>The lifting up of day.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Harcourt.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look, here’s more news.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Harcourt</span></p>

<p>From enemies heavens keep your Majesty,</p>

<p>And when they stand against you, may they fall</p>

<p>As those that I am come to tell you of.</p>

<p>The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,</p>

<p>With a great power of English and of Scots,</p>

<p>Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown.</p>

<p>The manner and true order of the fight</p>

<p>This packet, please it you, contains at large.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives the King papers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>And wherefore should these good news make me</p>

<p>sick?</p>

<p>Will Fortune never come with both hands full,</p>

<p>But write her fair words still in foulest letters?</p>

<p>She either gives a stomach and no food–</p>

<p>Such are the poor, in health–or else a feast</p>

<p>And takes away the stomach–such are the rich,</p>

<p>That have abundance and enjoy it not.</p>

<p>I should rejoice now at this happy news,</p>

<p>And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy.</p>

<p>O, me! Come near me, now I am much ill.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Humphrey</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Comfort, your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Clarence</span>  O, my royal father!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Be patient, princes. You do know these fits</p>

<p>Are with his Highness very ordinary.</p>

<p>Stand from him, give him air. He’ll straight be</p>

<p>well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs.</p>

<p>Th’ incessant care and labor of his mind</p>

<p>Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in</p>

<p>So thin that life looks through and will break out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Humphrey</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>The people fear me, for they do observe</p>

<p>Unfathered heirs and loathly births of nature.</p>

<p>The seasons change their manners, as the year</p>

<p>Had found some months asleep and leapt them</p>

<p>over.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>The river hath thrice flowed, no ebb between,</p>

<p>And the old folk, time’s doting chronicles,</p>

<p>Say it did so a little time before</p>

<p>That our great-grandsire, Edward, sicked and died.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Speak lower, princes, for the King recovers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Humphrey</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>This apoplexy will certain be his end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>I pray you take me up and bear me hence</p>

<p>Into some other chamber. Softly, pray.</p>

<p><center><i>[The King is carried to a bed on another</p>

<p>part of the stage.]</i></center></p>

<p>Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends,</p>

<p>Unless some dull and favorable hand</p>

<p>Will whisper music to my weary spirit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span> <i>[to an Attendant]</i></p>

<p>Call for the music in the other room.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Set me the crown upon my pillow here.</p>

<p><center><i>[The crown is placed on the bed.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Clarence</span> <i>[aside to the others]</i></p>

<p>His eye is hollow, and he changes much.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Less noise, less noise.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Prince Harry.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Who saw the Duke of Clarence?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Clarence</span> <i>[weeping]</i></p>

<p>I am here, brother, full of heaviness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>How now, rain within doors, and none abroad?</p>

<p>How doth the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Humphrey</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  Exceeding ill.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>Heard he the good news yet? Tell it him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Humphrey</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>He altered much upon the hearing it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  If he be sick with joy, he’ll recover without</p>

<p>physic.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Not so much noise, my lords.–Sweet prince, speak</p>

<p>low.</p>

<p>The King your father is disposed to sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>Let us withdraw into the other room.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Will ’t please your Grace to go along with us?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>No, I will sit and watch here by the King.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Prince and King exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,</p>

<p>Being so troublesome a bedfellow?</p>

<p>O polished perturbation, golden care,</p>

<p>That keep’st the ports of slumber open wide</p>

<p>To many a watchful night! Sleep with it now;</p>

<p>Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet</p>

<p>As he whose brow with homely biggen bound</p>

<p>Snores out the watch of night. O majesty,</p>

<p>When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit</p>

<p>Like a rich armor worn in heat of day,</p>

<p>That scald’st with safety. By his gates of breath</p>

<p>There lies a downy feather which stirs not;</p>

<p>Did he suspire, that light and weightless down</p>

<p>Perforce must move. My gracious lord, my father,</p>

<p>This sleep is sound indeed. This is a sleep</p>

<p>That from this golden rigol hath divorced</p>

<p>So many English kings. Thy due from me</p>

<p>Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,</p>

<p>Which nature, love, and filial tenderness</p>

<p>Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously.</p>

<p>My due from thee is this imperial crown,</p>

<p>Which, as immediate from thy place and blood,</p>

<p>Derives itself to me. <i>[He puts on the crown.]</i> Lo,</p>

<p>where it sits,</p>

<p>Which God shall guard. And, put the world’s whole</p>

<p>strength</p>

<p>Into one giant arm, it shall not force</p>

<p>This lineal honor from me. This from thee</p>

<p>Will I to mine leave, as ’tis left to me.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with the crown.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[rising up in his bed]</i>  Warwick! Gloucester!</p>

<p>Clarence!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Warwick, Gloucester, Clarence, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Clarence</span>  Doth the King call?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>What would your Majesty? How fares your Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Clarence</span></p>

<p>We left the Prince my brother here, my liege,</p>

<p>Who undertook to sit and watch by you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>The Prince of Wales? Where is he? Let me see him.</p>

<p>He is not here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>This door is open. He is gone this way.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Humphrey</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>He came not through the chamber where we</p>

<p>stayed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>The Prince hath ta’en it hence. Go seek him out.</p>

<p>Is he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my</p>

<p>death?</p>

<p>Find him, my Lord of Warwick. Chide him hither.</p>

<p><center><i>[Warwick exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>This part of his conjoins with my disease</p>

<p>And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you</p>

<p>are,</p>

<p>How quickly nature falls into revolt</p>

<p>When gold becomes her object!</p>

<p>For this the foolish overcareful fathers</p>

<p>Have broke their sleep with thoughts,</p>

<p>Their brains with care, their bones with industry.</p>

<p>For this they have engrossed and piled up</p>

<p>The cankered heaps of strange-achieved gold.</p>

<p>For this they have been thoughtful to invest</p>

<p>Their sons with arts and martial exercises–</p>

<p>When, like the bee, tolling from every flower</p>

<p>The virtuous sweets,</p>

<p>Our thighs packed with wax, our mouths with</p>

<p>honey,</p>

<p>We bring it to the hive and, like the bees,</p>

<p>Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste</p>

<p>Yields his engrossments to the ending father.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Warwick.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now where is he that will not stay so long</p>

<p>Till his friend sickness hath determined me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>My lord, I found the Prince in the next room,</p>

<p>Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,</p>

<p>With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow</p>

<p>That tyranny, which never quaffed but blood,</p>

<p>Would, by beholding him, have washed his knife</p>

<p>With gentle eyedrops. He is coming hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>But wherefore did he take away the crown?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Prince Harry with the crown.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Lo where he comes.–Come hither to me, Harry.–</p>

<p>Depart the chamber. Leave us here alone.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gloucester, Clarence, Warwick, and others exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>I never thought to hear you speak again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought.</p>

<p>I stay too long by thee; I weary thee.</p>

<p>Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair</p>

<p>That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors</p>

<p>Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth,</p>

<p>Thou seek’st the greatness that will overwhelm</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<p>Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity</p>

<p>Is held from falling with so weak a wind</p>

<p>That it will quickly drop. My day is dim.</p>

<p>Thou hast stol’n that which after some few hours</p>

<p>Were thine without offense, and at my death</p>

<p>Thou hast sealed up my expectation.</p>

<p>Thy life did manifest thou loved’st me not,</p>

<p>And thou wilt have me die assured of it.</p>

<p>Thou hid’st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,</p>

<p>Whom thou hast whetted on thy stony heart</p>

<p>To stab at half an hour of my life.</p>

<p>What, canst thou not forbear me half an hour?</p>

<p>Then get thee gone, and dig my grave thyself,</p>

<p>And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear</p>

<p>That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.</p>

<p>Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse</p>

<p>Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head;</p>

<p>Only compound me with forgotten dust.</p>

<p>Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.</p>

<p>Pluck down my officers, break my decrees,</p>

<p>For now a time is come to mock at form.</p>

<p>Harry the Fifth is crowned. Up, vanity,</p>

<p>Down, royal state, all you sage councillors,</p>

<p>hence,</p>

<p>And to the English court assemble now,</p>

<p>From every region, apes of idleness.</p>

<p>Now, neighbor confines, purge you of your scum.</p>

<p>Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,</p>

<p>Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit</p>

<p>The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?</p>

<p>Be happy, he will trouble you no more.</p>

<p>England shall double gild his treble guilt.</p>

<p>England shall give him office, honor, might,</p>

<p>For the fifth Harry from curbed license plucks</p>

<p>The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog</p>

<p>Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.</p>

<p>O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!</p>

<p>When that my care could not withhold thy riots,</p>

<p>What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?</p>

<p>O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,</p>

<p>Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <i>[placing the crown on the pillow]</i></p>

<p>O pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,</p>

<p>The moist impediments unto my speech,</p>

<p>I had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke</p>

<p>Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard</p>

<p>The course of it so far. There is your crown,</p>

<p>And He that wears the crown immortally</p>

<p>Long guard it yours. <i>[He kneels.]</i> If I affect it</p>

<p>more</p>

<p>Than as your honor and as your renown,</p>

<p>Let me no more from this obedience rise,</p>

<p>Which my most inward true and duteous spirit</p>

<p>Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending.</p>

<p>God witness with me, when I here came in</p>

<p>And found no course of breath within your Majesty,</p>

<p>How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,</p>

<p>O, let me in my present wildness die</p>

<p>And never live to show th’ incredulous world</p>

<p>The noble change that I have purposed.</p>

<p>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</p>

<p>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</p>

<p>I spake unto this crown as having sense,</p>

<p>And thus upbraided it: “The care on thee</p>

<p>depending</p>

<p>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</p>

<p>Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold.</p>

<p>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,</p>

<p>Preserving life in med’cine potable;</p>

<p>But thou, most fine, most honored, most renowned,</p>

<p>Hast eat thy bearer up.” Thus, my most royal liege,</p>

<p>Accusing it, I put it on my head</p>

<p>To try with it, as with an enemy</p>

<p>That had before my face murdered my father,</p>

<p>The quarrel of a true inheritor.</p>

<p>But if it did infect my blood with joy</p>

<p>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride,</p>

<p>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine</p>

<p>Did with the least affection of a welcome</p>

<p>Give entertainment to the might of it,</p>

<p>Let God forever keep it from my head</p>

<p>And make me as the poorest vassal is</p>

<p>That doth with awe and terror kneel to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  O my son,</p>

<p>God put it in thy mind to take it hence</p>

<p>That thou mightst win the more thy father’s love,</p>

<p>Pleading so wisely in excuse of it.</p>

<p>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed</p>

<p>And hear, I think, the very latest counsel</p>

<p>That ever I shall breathe.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Prince rises from his knees and sits</p>

<p>near the bed.]</i></center></p>

<p>God knows, my son,</p>

<p>By what bypaths and indirect crook’d ways</p>

<p>I met this crown, and I myself know well</p>

<p>How troublesome it sat upon my head.</p>

<p>To thee it shall descend with better quiet,</p>

<p>Better opinion, better confirmation,</p>

<p>For all the soil of the achievement goes</p>

<p>With me into the earth. It seemed in me</p>

<p>But as an honor snatched with boist’rous hand,</p>

<p>And I had many living to upbraid</p>

<p>My gain of it by their assistances,</p>

<p>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</p>

<p>Wounding supposed peace. All these bold fears</p>

<p>Thou seest with peril I have answered,</p>

<p>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</p>

<p>Acting that argument. And now my death</p>

<p>Changes the mood, for what in me was purchased</p>

<p>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort.</p>

<p>So thou the garland wear’st successively.</p>

<p>Yet though thou stand’st more sure than I could do,</p>

<p>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green,</p>

<p>And all my friends, which thou must make thy</p>

<p>friends,</p>

<p>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta’en out,</p>

<p>By whose fell working I was first advanced</p>

<p>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</p>

<p>To be again displaced; which to avoid,</p>

<p>I cut them off and had a purpose now</p>

<p>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</p>

<p>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</p>

<p>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</p>

<p>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</p>

<p>With foreign quarrels, that action, hence borne</p>

<p>out,</p>

<p>May waste the memory of the former days.</p>

<p>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</p>

<p>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</p>

<p>How I came by the crown, O God forgive,</p>

<p>And grant it may with thee in true peace live.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  My gracious liege,</p>

<p>You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me.</p>

<p>Then plain and right must my possession be,</p>

<p>Which I with more than with a common pain</p>

<p>’Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter John of Lancaster and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>John</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Lancaster</span></p>

<p>Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Thou bring’st me happiness and peace, son John,</p>

<p>But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown</p>

<p>From this bare withered trunk. Upon thy sight</p>

<p>My worldly business makes a period.</p>

<p>Where is my Lord of Warwick?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  My Lord of Warwick.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Warwick.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Doth any name particular belong</p>

<p>Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>’Tis called Jerusalem, my noble lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Laud be to God! Even there my life must end.</p>

<p>It hath been prophesied to me many years,</p>

<p>I should not die but in Jerusalem,</p>

<p>Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land.</p>

<p>But bear me to that chamber; there I’ll lie.</p>

<p>In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.</p>
