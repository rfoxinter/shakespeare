<p><center><i>[Enter Northumberland, his wife, and the wife to</p>

<p>Harry Percy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>I pray thee, loving wife and gentle daughter,</p>

<p>Give even way unto my rough affairs.</p>

<p>Put not you on the visage of the times</p>

<p>And be, like them, to Percy troublesome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>I have given over. I will speak no more.</p>

<p>Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Alas, sweet wife, my honor is at pawn,</p>

<p>And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Percy</span></p>

<p>O yet, for God’s sake, go not to these wars.</p>

<p>The time was, father, that you broke your word</p>

<p>When you were more endeared to it than now,</p>

<p>When your own Percy, when my heart’s dear Harry,</p>

<p>Threw many a northward look to see his father</p>

<p>Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.</p>

<p>Who then persuaded you to stay at home?</p>

<p>There were two honors lost, yours and your son’s.</p>

<p>For yours, the God of heaven brighten it.</p>

<p>For his, it stuck upon him as the sun</p>

<p>In the gray vault of heaven, and by his light</p>

<p>Did all the chivalry of England move</p>

<p>To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass</p>

<p>Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves.</p>

<p>He had no legs that practiced not his gait;</p>

<p>And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,</p>

<p>Became the accents of the valiant;</p>

<p>For those that could speak low and tardily</p>

<p>Would turn their own perfection to abuse</p>

<p>To seem like him. So that in speech, in gait,</p>

<p>In diet, in affections of delight,</p>

<p>In military rules, humors of blood,</p>

<p>He was the mark and glass, copy and book,</p>

<p>That fashioned others. And him–O wondrous him!</p>

<p>O miracle of men!–him did you leave,</p>

<p>Second to none, unseconded by you,</p>

<p>To look upon the hideous god of war</p>

<p>In disadvantage, to abide a field</p>

<p>Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur’s name</p>

<p>Did seem defensible. So you left him.</p>

<p>Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong</p>

<p>To hold your honor more precise and nice</p>

<p>With others than with him. Let them alone.</p>

<p>The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong.</p>

<p>Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,</p>

<p>Today might I, hanging on Hotspur’s neck,</p>

<p>Have talked of Monmouth’s grave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  Beshrew your</p>

<p>heart,</p>

<p>Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me</p>

<p>With new lamenting ancient oversights.</p>

<p>But I must go and meet with danger there,</p>

<p>Or it will seek me in another place</p>

<p>And find me worse provided.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  O, fly to Scotland</p>

<p>Till that the nobles and the armed commons</p>

<p>Have of their puissance made a little taste.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Percy</span></p>

<p>If they get ground and vantage of the King,</p>

<p>Then join you with them like a rib of steel</p>

<p>To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,</p>

<p>First let them try themselves. So did your son;</p>

<p>He was so suffered. So came I a widow,</p>

<p>And never shall have length of life enough</p>

<p>To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes</p>

<p>That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven</p>

<p>For recordation to my noble husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Come, come, go in with me. ’Tis with my mind</p>

<p>As with the tide swelled up unto his height,</p>

<p>That makes a still-stand, running neither way.</p>

<p>Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop,</p>

<p>But many thousand reasons hold me back.</p>

<p>I will resolve for Scotland. There am I</p>

<p>Till time and vantage crave my company.</p>
