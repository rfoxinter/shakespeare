<p><center><i>[Enter the King in his nightgown with a Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;</p>

<p>But, ere they come, bid them o’erread these letters</p>

<p>And well consider of them. Make good speed.</p>

<p><center><i>[Page exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>How many thousand of my poorest subjects</p>

<p>Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,</p>

<p>Nature’s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,</p>

<p>That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down</p>

<p>And steep my senses in forgetfulness?</p>

<p>Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,</p>

<p>Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,</p>

<p>And hushed with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,</p>

<p>Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,</p>

<p>Under the canopies of costly state,</p>

<p>And lulled with sound of sweetest melody?</p>

<p>O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile</p>

<p>In loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch</p>

<p>A watch-case or a common ’larum bell?</p>

<p>Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast</p>

<p>Seal up the shipboy’s eyes and rock his brains</p>

<p>In cradle of the rude imperious surge</p>

<p>And in the visitation of the winds,</p>

<p>Who take the ruffian billows by the top,</p>

<p>Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them</p>

<p>With deafing clamor in the slippery clouds</p>

<p>That with the hurly death itself awakes?</p>

<p>Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose</p>

<p>To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,</p>

<p>And, in the calmest and most stillest night,</p>

<p>With all appliances and means to boot,</p>

<p>Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down.</p>

<p>Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Warwick, Surrey and Sir John Blunt.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Many good morrows to your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Is it good morrow, lords?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc>  ’Tis one o’clock, and past.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Why then, good morrow to you all, my lords.</p>

<p>Have you read o’er the letter that I sent you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc>  We have, my liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Then you perceive the body of our kingdom</p>

<p>How foul it is, what rank diseases grow,</p>

<p>And with what danger near the heart of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>It is but as a body yet distempered,</p>

<p>Which to his former strength may be restored</p>

<p>With good advice and little medicine.</p>

<p>My Lord Northumberland will soon be cooled.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>O God, that one might read the book of fate</p>

<p>And see the revolution of the times</p>

<p>Make mountains level, and the continent,</p>

<p>Weary of solid firmness, melt itself</p>

<p>Into the sea, and other times to see</p>

<p>The beachy girdle of the ocean</p>

<p>Too wide for Neptune’s hips; how chance’s mocks</p>

<p>And changes fill the cup of alteration</p>

<p>With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,</p>

<p>The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,</p>

<p>What perils past, what crosses to ensue,</p>

<p>Would shut the book and sit him down and die.</p>

<p>’Tis not ten years gone</p>

<p>Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,</p>

<p>Did feast together, and in two years after</p>

<p>Were they at wars. It is but eight years since</p>

<p>This Percy was the man nearest my soul,</p>

<p>Who like a brother toiled in my affairs</p>

<p>And laid his love and life under my foot,</p>

<p>Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard</p>

<p>Gave him defiance. But which of you was by–</p>

<p><i>[To Warwick.]</i> You, cousin Nevil, as I may</p>

<p>remember–</p>

<p>When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,</p>

<p>Then checked and rated by Northumberland,</p>

<p>Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?</p>

<p>“Northumberland, thou ladder by the which</p>

<p>My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne”–</p>

<p>Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,</p>

<p>But that necessity so bowed the state</p>

<p>That I and greatness were compelled to kiss–</p>

<p>“The time shall come,” thus did he follow it,</p>

<p>“The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,</p>

<p>Shall break into corruption”–so went on,</p>

<p>Foretelling this same time’s condition</p>

<p>And the division of our amity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>There is a history in all men’s lives</p>

<p>Figuring the natures of the times deceased,</p>

<p>The which observed, a man may prophesy,</p>

<p>With a near aim, of the main chance of things</p>

<p>As yet not come to life, who in their seeds</p>

<p>And weak beginning lie intreasured.</p>

<p>Such things become the hatch and brood of time,</p>

<p>And by the necessary form of this,</p>

<p>King Richard might create a perfect guess</p>

<p>That great Northumberland, then false to him,</p>

<p>Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness,</p>

<p>Which should not find a ground to root upon</p>

<p>Unless on you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Are these things then necessities?</p>

<p>Then let us meet them like necessities.</p>

<p>And that same word even now cries out on us.</p>

<p>They say the Bishop and Northumberland</p>

<p>Are fifty thousand strong.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc>  It cannot be, my lord.</p>

<p>Rumor doth double, like the voice and echo,</p>

<p>The numbers of the feared. Please it your Grace</p>

<p>To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,</p>

<p>The powers that you already have sent forth</p>

<p>Shall bring this prize in very easily.</p>

<p>To comfort you the more, I have received</p>

<p>A certain instance that Glendower is dead.</p>

<p>Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill,</p>

<p>And these unseasoned hours perforce must add</p>

<p>Unto your sickness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  I will take your counsel.</p>

<p>And were these inward wars once out of hand,</p>

<p>We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.</p>
