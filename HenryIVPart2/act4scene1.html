<p><center><i>[Enter the Archbishop of York, Mowbray, Lord</p>

<p>Bardolph, Hastings, and their officers within the Forest</p>

<p>of Gaultree.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span>  What is this forest called?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>’Tis Gaultree Forest, an ’t shall please your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>Here stand, my lords, and send discoverers forth</p>

<p>To know the numbers of our enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>We have sent forth already.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span>  ’Tis well done.</p>

<p>My friends and brethren in these great affairs,</p>

<p>I must acquaint you that I have received</p>

<p>New-dated letters from Northumberland,</p>

<p>Their cold intent, tenor, and substance, thus:</p>

<p>Here doth he wish his person, with such powers</p>

<p>As might hold sortance with his quality,</p>

<p>The which he could not levy; whereupon</p>

<p>He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,</p>

<p>To Scotland, and concludes in hearty prayers</p>

<p>That your attempts may overlive the hazard</p>

<p>And fearful meeting of their opposite.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground</p>

<p>And dash themselves to pieces.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span>  Now, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,</p>

<p>In goodly form comes on the enemy,</p>

<p>And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number</p>

<p>Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>The just proportion that we gave them out.</p>

<p>Let us sway on and face them in the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Westmoreland.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>What well-appointed leader fronts us here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>Health and fair greeting from our general,</p>

<p>The Prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace,</p>

<p>What doth concern your coming.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span>  Then, my lord,</p>

<p>Unto your Grace do I in chief address</p>

<p>The substance of my speech. If that rebellion</p>

<p>Came like itself, in base and abject routs,</p>

<p>Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rage,</p>

<p>And countenanced by boys and beggary–</p>

<p>I say, if damned commotion so appeared</p>

<p>In his true, native, and most proper shape,</p>

<p>You, reverend father, and these noble lords</p>

<p>Had not been here to dress the ugly form</p>

<p>Of base and bloody insurrection</p>

<p>With your fair honors. You, Lord Archbishop,</p>

<p>Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,</p>

<p>Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touched,</p>

<p>Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutored,</p>

<p>Whose white investments figure innocence,</p>

<p>The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,</p>

<p>Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself</p>

<p>Out of the speech of peace, that bears such grace,</p>

<p>Into the harsh and boist’rous tongue of war,</p>

<p>Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,</p>

<p>Your pens to lances, and your tongue divine</p>

<p>To a loud trumpet and a point of war?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.</p>

<p>Briefly, to this end: we are all diseased</p>

<p>And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</p>

<p>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</p>

<p>And we must bleed for it; of which disease</p>

<p>Our late King Richard, being infected, died.</p>

<p>But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,</p>

<p>I take not on me here as a physician,</p>

<p>Nor do I as an enemy to peace</p>

<p>Troop in the throngs of military men,</p>

<p>But rather show awhile like fearful war</p>

<p>To diet rank minds sick of happiness</p>

<p>And purge th’ obstructions which begin to stop</p>

<p>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</p>

<p>I have in equal balance justly weighed</p>

<p>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we</p>

<p>suffer,</p>

<p>And find our griefs heavier than our offenses.</p>

<p>We see which way the stream of time doth run</p>

<p>And are enforced from our most quiet there</p>

<p>By the rough torrent of occasion,</p>

<p>And have the summary of all our griefs,</p>

<p>When time shall serve, to show in articles;</p>

<p>Which long ere this we offered to the King</p>

<p>And might by no suit gain our audience.</p>

<p>When we are wronged and would unfold our griefs,</p>

<p>We are denied access unto his person</p>

<p>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</p>

<p>The dangers of the days but newly gone,</p>

<p>Whose memory is written on the earth</p>

<p>With yet-appearing blood, and the examples</p>

<p>Of every minute’s instance, present now,</p>

<p>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,</p>

<p>Not to break peace or any branch of it,</p>

<p>But to establish here a peace indeed,</p>

<p>Concurring both in name and quality.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>Whenever yet was your appeal denied?</p>

<p>Wherein have you been galled by the King?</p>

<p>What peer hath been suborned to grate on you,</p>

<p>That you should seal this lawless bloody book</p>

<p>Of forged rebellion with a seal divine</p>

<p>And consecrate commotion’s bitter edge?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>My brother general, the commonwealth,</p>

<p>To brother born an household cruelty,</p>

<p>I make my quarrel in particular.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>There is no need of any such redress,</p>

<p>Or if there were, it not belongs to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>Why not to him in part, and to us all</p>

<p>That feel the bruises of the days before</p>

<p>And suffer the condition of these times</p>

<p>To lay a heavy and unequal hand</p>

<p>Upon our honors?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span>  O, my good Lord Mowbray,</p>

<p>Construe the times to their necessities,</p>

<p>And you shall say indeed it is the time,</p>

<p>And not the King, that doth you injuries.</p>

<p>Yet for your part, it not appears to me</p>

<p>Either from the King or in the present time</p>

<p>That you should have an inch of any ground</p>

<p>To build a grief on. Were you not restored</p>

<p>To all the Duke of Norfolk’s seigniories,</p>

<p>Your noble and right well remembered father’s?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>What thing, in honor, had my father lost</p>

<p>That need to be revived and breathed in me?</p>

<p>The King that loved him, as the state stood then,</p>

<p>Was force perforce compelled to banish him,</p>

<p>And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he,</p>

<p>Being mounted and both roused in their seats,</p>

<p>Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</p>

<p>Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,</p>

<p>Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,</p>

<p>And the loud trumpet blowing them together,</p>

<p>Then, then, when there was nothing could have</p>

<p>stayed</p>

<p>My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,</p>

<p>O, when the King did throw his warder down–</p>

<p>His own life hung upon the staff he threw–</p>

<p>Then threw he down himself and all their lives</p>

<p>That by indictment and by dint of sword</p>

<p>Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</p>

<p>The Earl of Hereford was reputed then</p>

<p>In England the most valiant gentleman.</p>

<p>Who knows on whom fortune would then have</p>

<p>smiled?</p>

<p>But if your father had been victor there,</p>

<p>He ne’er had borne it out of Coventry;</p>

<p>For all the country in a general voice</p>

<p>Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and</p>

<p>love</p>

<p>Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on</p>

<p>And blessed and graced, indeed more than the</p>

<p>King.</p>

<p>But this is mere digression from my purpose.</p>

<p>Here come I from our princely general</p>

<p>To know your griefs, to tell you from his Grace</p>

<p>That he will give you audience; and wherein</p>

<p>It shall appear that your demands are just,</p>

<p>You shall enjoy them, everything set off</p>

<p>That might so much as think you enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>But he hath forced us to compel this offer,</p>

<p>And it proceeds from policy, not love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>Mowbray, you overween to take it so.</p>

<p>This offer comes from mercy, not from fear.</p>

<p>For, lo, within a ken our army lies,</p>

<p>Upon mine honor, all too confident</p>

<p>To give admittance to a thought of fear.</p>

<p>Our battle is more full of names than yours,</p>

<p>Our men more perfect in the use of arms,</p>

<p>Our armor all as strong, our cause the best.</p>

<p>Then reason will our hearts should be as good.</p>

<p>Say you not then our offer is compelled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>Well, by my will, we shall admit no parley.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>That argues but the shame of your offense.</p>

<p>A rotten case abides no handling.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Hath the Prince John a full commission,</p>

<p>In very ample virtue of his father,</p>

<p>To hear and absolutely to determine</p>

<p>Of what conditions we shall stand upon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>That is intended in the General’s name.</p>

<p>I muse you make so slight a question.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span> <i>[giving Westmoreland a paper]</i></p>

<p>Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,</p>

<p>For this contains our general grievances.</p>

<p>Each several article herein redressed,</p>

<p>All members of our cause, both here and hence</p>

<p>That are insinewed to this action,</p>

<p>Acquitted by a true substantial form</p>

<p>And present execution of our wills</p>

<p>To us and to our purposes confined,</p>

<p>We come within our awful banks again</p>

<p>And knit our powers to the arm of peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>This will I show the General. Please you, lords,</p>

<p>In sight of both our battles we may meet,</p>

<p>And either end in peace, which God so frame,</p>

<p>Or to the place of difference call the swords</p>

<p>Which must decide it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span>  My lord, we will do so.</p>

<p><center><i>[Westmoreland exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>There is a thing within my bosom tells me</p>

<p>That no conditions of our peace can stand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Fear you not that. If we can make our peace</p>

<p>Upon such large terms and so absolute</p>

<p>As our conditions shall consist upon,</p>

<p>Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>Yea, but our valuation shall be such</p>

<p>That every slight and false-derived cause,</p>

<p>Yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason,</p>

<p>Shall to the King taste of this action,</p>

<p>That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,</p>

<p>We shall be winnowed with so rough a wind</p>

<p>That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff,</p>

<p>And good from bad find no partition.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is weary</p>

<p>Of dainty and such picking grievances,</p>

<p>For he hath found to end one doubt by death</p>

<p>Revives two greater in the heirs of life;</p>

<p>And therefore will he wipe his tables clean</p>

<p>And keep no telltale to his memory</p>

<p>That may repeat and history his loss</p>

<p>To new remembrance. For full well he knows</p>

<p>He cannot so precisely weed this land</p>

<p>As his misdoubts present occasion;</p>

<p>His foes are so enrooted with his friends</p>

<p>That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</p>

<p>He doth unfasten so and shake a friend;</p>

<p>So that this land, like an offensive wife</p>

<p>That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,</p>

<p>As he is striking holds his infant up</p>

<p>And hangs resolved correction in the arm</p>

<p>That was upreared to execution.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Besides, the King hath wasted all his rods</p>

<p>On late offenders, that he now doth lack</p>

<p>The very instruments of chastisement,</p>

<p>So that his power, like to a fangless lion,</p>

<p>May offer but not hold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span>  ’Tis very true,</p>

<p>And therefore be assured, my good Lord Marshal,</p>

<p>If we do now make our atonement well,</p>

<p>Our peace will, like a broken limb united,</p>

<p>Grow stronger for the breaking.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span>  Be it so.</p>

<p>Here is returned my Lord of Westmoreland.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Westmoreland.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span> <i>[to the Archbishop]</i></p>

<p>The Prince is here at hand. Pleaseth your Lordship</p>

<p>To meet his Grace just distance ’tween our armies.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Prince John and his army.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span> <i>[to the Archbishop]</i></p>

<p>Your Grace of York, in God’s name then set</p>

<p>forward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>Before, and greet his Grace.–My lord, we come.</p>

<p><center><i>[All move forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>John</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Lancaster</span></p>

<p>You are well encountered here, my cousin</p>

<p>Mowbray.–</p>

<p>Good day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop,–</p>

<p>And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.–</p>

<p>My Lord of York, it better showed with you</p>

<p>When that your flock, assembled by the bell,</p>

<p>Encircled you to hear with reverence</p>

<p>Your exposition on the holy text</p>

<p>Than now to see you here, an iron man talking,</p>

<p>Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,</p>

<p>Turning the word to sword, and life to death.</p>

<p>That man that sits within a monarch’s heart</p>

<p>And ripens in the sunshine of his favor,</p>

<p>Would he abuse the countenance of the King,</p>

<p>Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroach</p>

<p>In shadow of such greatness! With you, Lord</p>

<p>Bishop,</p>

<p>It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken</p>

<p>How deep you were within the books of God,</p>

<p>To us the speaker in His parliament,</p>

<p>To us th’ imagined voice of God Himself,</p>

<p>The very opener and intelligencer</p>

<p>Between the grace, the sanctities, of heaven,</p>

<p>And our dull workings? O, who shall believe</p>

<p>But you misuse the reverence of your place,</p>

<p>Employ the countenance and grace of heaven</p>

<p>As a false favorite doth his prince’s name,</p>

<p>In deeds dishonorable? You have ta’en up,</p>

<p>Under the counterfeited zeal of God,</p>

<p>The subjects of His substitute, my father,</p>

<p>And both against the peace of heaven and him</p>

<p>Have here up-swarmed them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span>  Good my Lord of</p>

<p>Lancaster,</p>

<p>I am not here against your father’s peace,</p>

<p>But, as I told my Lord of Westmoreland,</p>

<p>The time misordered doth, in common sense,</p>

<p>Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form</p>

<p>To hold our safety up. I sent your Grace</p>

<p>The parcels and particulars of our grief,</p>

<p>The which hath been with scorn shoved from the</p>

<p>court,</p>

<p>Whereon this Hydra son of war is born,</p>

<p>Whose dangerous eyes may well be charmed asleep</p>

<p>With grant of our most just and right desires,</p>

<p>And true obedience, of this madness cured,</p>

<p>Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>If not, we ready are to try our fortunes</p>

<p>To the last man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span>  And though we here fall down,</p>

<p>We have supplies to second our attempt;</p>

<p>If they miscarry, theirs shall second them,</p>

<p>And so success of mischief shall be born,</p>

<p>And heir from heir shall hold his quarrel up</p>

<p>Whiles England shall have generation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>John</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Lancaster</span></p>

<p>You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow</p>

<p>To sound the bottom of the after-times.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly</p>

<p>How far forth you do like their articles.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>John</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Lancaster</span></p>

<p>I like them all, and do allow them well,</p>

<p>And swear here by the honor of my blood</p>

<p>My father’s purposes have been mistook,</p>

<p>And some about him have too lavishly</p>

<p>Wrested his meaning and authority.</p>

<p><i>[To the Archbishop.]</i> My lord, these griefs shall be</p>

<p>with speed redressed;</p>

<p>Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,</p>

<p>Discharge your powers unto their several counties,</p>

<p>As we will ours, and here, between the armies,</p>

<p>Let’s drink together friendly and embrace,</p>

<p>That all their eyes may bear those tokens home</p>

<p>Of our restored love and amity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>I take your princely word for these redresses.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>John</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Lancaster</span></p>

<p>I give it you, and will maintain my word,</p>

<p>And thereupon I drink unto your Grace.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Leaders of both armies begin to drink together.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span> <i>[to an Officer]</i></p>

<p>Go, captain, and deliver to the army</p>

<p>This news of peace. Let them have pay, and part.</p>

<p>I pledge your Grace, and if you knew what pains</p>

<p>I have bestowed to breed this present peace,</p>

<p>You would drink freely. But my love to you</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>I do not doubt you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span>  I am glad of it.–</p>

<p>Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>You wish me health in very happy season,</p>

<p>For I am on the sudden something ill.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>Against ill chances men are ever merry,</p>

<p>But heaviness foreruns the good event.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>Therefore be merry, coz, since sudden sorrow</p>

<p>Serves to say thus: “Some good thing comes</p>

<p>tomorrow.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>This had been cheerful after victory.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>A peace is of the nature of a conquest,</p>

<p>For then both parties nobly are subdued,</p>

<p>Good tidings, my Lord Hastings, for the which</p>

<p>I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason.–</p>

<p>And you, Lord Archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,</p>

<p>Of capital treason I attach you both.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>Is this proceeding just and honorable?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span>  Is your assembly so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>Will you thus break your faith?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>John</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Lancaster</span>  I pawned thee none.</p>

<p>I promised you redress of these same grievances</p>

<p>Whereof you did complain, which, by mine honor,</p>

<p>I will perform with a most Christian care.</p>

<p>But for you rebels, look to taste the due</p>

<p>Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.</p>

<p>Most shallowly did you these arms commence,</p>

<p>Fondly brought here, and foolishly sent hence.–</p>

<p>Strike up our drums; pursue the scattered stray.</p>

<p>God, and not we, hath safely fought today.–</p>

<p>Some guard these traitors to the block of death,</p>

<p>Treason’s true bed and yielder-up of breath.</p>
