<p><center><i>[Alarum. Excursions. Enter Falstaff and Colevile.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What’s your name, sir? Of what condition are</p>

<p>you, and of what place, I pray?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Colevile</sc>  I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of</p>

<p>the Dale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Well then, Colevile is your name, a knight is</p>

<p>your degree, and your place the Dale. Colevile shall</p>

<p>be still your name, a traitor your degree, and the</p>

<p>dungeon your place, a place deep enough so shall</p>

<p>you be still Colevile of the Dale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Colevile</sc>  Are not you Sir John Falstaff?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  As good a man as he, sir, whoe’er I am. Do</p>

<p>you yield, sir, or shall I sweat for you? If I do sweat,</p>

<p>they are the drops of thy lovers and they weep for</p>

<p>thy death. Therefore rouse up fear and trembling,</p>

<p>and do observance to my mercy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Colevile</sc>  I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that</p>

<p>thought yield me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I have a whole school of tongues in this belly</p>

<p>of mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any</p>

<p>other word but my name. An I had but a belly of any</p>

<p>indifferency, I were simply the most active fellow in</p>

<p>Europe. My womb, my womb, my womb undoes</p>

<p>me. Here comes our general.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter John, Westmoreland, and the rest.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc></p>

<p>The heat is past. Follow no further now.</p>

<p>Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.</p>

<p><center><i>[Westmoreland exits. Retreat is sounded.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?</p>

<p>When everything is ended, then you come.</p>

<p>These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,</p>

<p>One time or other break some gallows’ back.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be</p>

<p>thus. I never knew yet but rebuke and check was the</p>

<p>reward of valor. Do you think me a swallow, an</p>

<p>arrow, or a bullet? Have I in my poor and old</p>

<p>motion the expedition of thought? I have speeded</p>

<p>hither with the very extremest inch of possibility. I</p>

<p>have foundered ninescore and odd posts, and here,</p>

<p>travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and immaculate</p>

<p>valor taken Sir John Colevile of the Dale, a most</p>

<p>furious knight and valorous enemy. But what of</p>

<p>that? He saw me and yielded, that I may justly say,</p>

<p>with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome, “There, cousin,</p>

<p>I came, saw, and overcame.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc>  It was more of his courtesy than</p>

<p>your deserving.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I know not. Here he is, and here I yield him.</p>

<p>And I beseech your Grace let it be booked with the</p>

<p>rest of this day’s deeds, or, by the Lord, I will have it</p>

<p>in a particular ballad else, with mine own picture</p>

<p>on the top on ’t, Colevile kissing my foot; to the</p>

<p>which course if I be enforced, if you do not all show</p>

<p>like gilt twopences to me, and I in the clear sky of</p>

<p>fame o’ershine you as much as the full moon doth</p>

<p>the cinders of the element (which show like pins’</p>

<p>heads to her), believe not the word of the noble.</p>

<p>Therefore let me have right, and let desert mount.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc>  Thine’s too heavy to mount.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Let it shine, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc>  Thine’s too thick to shine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Let it do something, my good lord, that may</p>

<p>do me good, and call it what you will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc>  Is thy name Colevile?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Colevile</sc>  It is, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc>  A famous rebel art thou,</p>

<p>Colevile.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  And a famous true subject took him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Colevile</sc></p>

<p>I am, my lord, but as my betters are</p>

<p>That led me hither. Had they been ruled by me,</p>

<p>You should have won them dearer than you have.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I know not how they sold themselves, but</p>

<p>thou, like a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis,</p>

<p>and I thank thee for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Westmoreland.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc>  Now, have you left pursuit?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Westmoreland</sc></p>

<p>Retreat is made and execution stayed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc></p>

<p>Send Colevile with his confederates</p>

<p>To York, to present execution.–</p>

<p>Blunt, lead him hence, and see you guard him sure.</p>

<p><center><i>[Blunt exits with Colevile.]</i></center></p>

<p>And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords.</p>

<p>I hear the King my father is sore sick.</p>

<p>Our news shall go before us to his Majesty,</p>

<p><i>[To Westmoreland.]</i> Which, cousin, you shall bear</p>

<p>to comfort him,</p>

<p>And we with sober speed will follow you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  My lord, I beseech you give me leave to go</p>

<p>through Gloucestershire, and, when you come to</p>

<p>court, stand my good lord, pray, in your good</p>

<p>report.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc></p>

<p>Fare you well, Falstaff. I, in my condition,</p>

<p>Shall better speak of you than you deserve.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Falstaff exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I would you had but the wit; ’twere better</p>

<p>than your dukedom. Good faith, this same young</p>

<p>sober-blooded boy doth not love me, nor a man</p>

<p>cannot make him laugh. But that’s no marvel; he</p>

<p>drinks no wine. There’s never none of these demure</p>

<p>boys come to any proof, for thin drink doth so</p>

<p>overcool their blood, and making many fish meals,</p>

<p>that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness, and</p>

<p>then, when they marry, they get wenches. They are</p>

<p>generally fools and cowards, which some of us</p>

<p>should be too, but for inflammation. A good sherris</p>

<p>sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It ascends me</p>

<p>into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and</p>

<p>dull and crudy vapors which environ it, makes it</p>

<p>apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery,</p>

<p>and delectable shapes, which, delivered o’er to the</p>

<p>voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes</p>

<p>excellent wit. The second property of your excellent</p>

<p>sherris is the warming of the blood, which,</p>

<p>before cold and settled, left the liver white and pale,</p>

<p>which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice.</p>

<p>But the sherris warms it and makes it course from</p>

<p>the inwards to the parts’ extremes. It illumineth the</p>

<p>face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest</p>

<p>of this little kingdom, man, to arm; and then the</p>

<p>vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me</p>

<p>all to their captain, the heart, who, great and puffed</p>

<p>up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage, and</p>

<p>this valor comes of sherris. So that skill in the</p>

<p>weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets it</p>

<p>a-work; and learning a mere hoard of gold kept</p>

<p>by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in</p>

<p>act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is</p>

<p>valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally inherit</p>

<p>of his father he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare</p>

<p>land, manured, husbanded, and tilled with excellent</p>

<p>endeavor of drinking good and good store</p>

<p>of fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant.</p>

<p>If I had a thousand sons, the first human principle</p>

<p>I would teach them should be to forswear</p>

<p>thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bardolph.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Bardolph?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  The army is discharged all and gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Let them go. I’ll through Gloucestershire,</p>

<p>and there will I visit Master Robert Shallow,</p>

<p>Esquire. I have him already temp’ring between my</p>

<p>finger and my thumb, and shortly will I seal with</p>

<p>him. Come away.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
