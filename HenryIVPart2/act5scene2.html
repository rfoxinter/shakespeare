<p><center><i>[Enter Warwick and Lord Chief Justice.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>How now, my Lord Chief Justice, whither away?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  How doth the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Exceeding well. His cares are now all ended.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc></p>

<p>I hope, not dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc>  He’s walked the way of nature,</p>

<p>And to our purposes he lives no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc></p>

<p>I would his Majesty had called me with him.</p>

<p>The service that I truly did his life</p>

<p>Hath left me open to all injuries.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Indeed, I think the young king loves you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc></p>

<p>I know he doth not, and do arm myself</p>

<p>To welcome the condition of the time,</p>

<p>Which cannot look more hideously upon me</p>

<p>Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter John, Thomas, and Humphrey.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry.</p>

<p>O, that the living Harry had the temper</p>

<p>Of he the worst of these three gentlemen!</p>

<p>How many nobles then should hold their places</p>

<p>That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc></p>

<p>O God, I fear all will be overturned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc></p>

<p>Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Humphrey</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Gloucester</sc> <sc>Thomas</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Clarence</sc>  Good morrow, cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc></p>

<p>We meet like men that had forgot to speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>We do remember, but our argument</p>

<p>Is all too heavy to admit much talk.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc></p>

<p>Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc></p>

<p>Peace be with us, lest we be heavier.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Humphrey</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed,</p>

<p>And I dare swear you borrow not that face</p>

<p>Of seeming sorrow; it is sure your own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>John</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Lancaster</sc> <i>[to the Chief Justice]</i></p>

<p>Though no man be assured what grace to find,</p>

<p>You stand in coldest expectation.</p>

<p>I am the sorrier; would ’twere otherwise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thomas</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Clarence</sc></p>

<p>Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair,</p>

<p>Which swims against your stream of quality.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc></p>

<p>Sweet princes, what I did I did in honor,</p>

<p>Led by th’ impartial conduct of my soul;</p>

<p>And never shall you see that I will beg</p>

<p>A ragged and forestalled remission.</p>

<p>If truth and upright innocency fail me,</p>

<p>I’ll to the king my master that is dead</p>

<p>And tell him who hath sent me after him.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Prince, as Henry V, and Blunt.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc>  Here comes the Prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc></p>

<p>Good morrow, and God save your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>This new and gorgeous garment majesty</p>

<p>Sits not so easy on me as you think.–</p>

<p>Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear.</p>

<p>This is the English, not the Turkish court;</p>

<p>Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,</p>

<p>But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,</p>

<p>For, by my faith, it very well becomes you.</p>

<p>Sorrow so royally in you appears</p>

<p>That I will deeply put the fashion on</p>

<p>And wear it in my heart. Why then, be sad.</p>

<p>But entertain no more of it, good brothers,</p>

<p>Than a joint burden laid upon us all.</p>

<p>For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,</p>

<p>I’ll be your father and your brother too.</p>

<p>Let me but bear your love, I’ll bear your cares.</p>

<p>Yet weep that Harry’s dead, and so will I,</p>

<p>But Harry lives that shall convert those tears</p>

<p>By number into hours of happiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brothers</sc></p>

<p>We hope no otherwise from your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>You all look strangely on me. <i>[To the Chief Justice.]</i></p>

<p>And you most.</p>

<p>You are, I think, assured I love you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc></p>

<p>I am assured, if I be measured rightly,</p>

<p>Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>No? How might a prince of my great hopes forget</p>

<p>So great indignities you laid upon me?</p>

<p>What, rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison</p>

<p>Th’ immediate heir of England? Was this easy?</p>

<p>May this be washed in Lethe and forgotten?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc></p>

<p>I then did use the person of your father;</p>

<p>The image of his power lay then in me.</p>

<p>And in th’ administration of his law,</p>

<p>Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,</p>

<p>Your Highness pleased to forget my place,</p>

<p>The majesty and power of law and justice,</p>

<p>The image of the King whom I presented,</p>

<p>And struck me in my very seat of judgment,</p>

<p>Whereon, as an offender to your father,</p>

<p>I gave bold way to my authority</p>

<p>And did commit you. If the deed were ill,</p>

<p>Be you contented, wearing now the garland,</p>

<p>To have a son set your decrees at nought?</p>

<p>To pluck down justice from your awful bench?</p>

<p>To trip the course of law and blunt the sword</p>

<p>That guards the peace and safety of your person?</p>

<p>Nay more, to spurn at your most royal image</p>

<p>And mock your workings in a second body?</p>

<p>Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;</p>

<p>Be now the father and propose a son,</p>

<p>Hear your own dignity so much profaned,</p>

<p>See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,</p>

<p>Behold yourself so by a son disdained,</p>

<p>And then imagine me taking your part</p>

<p>And in your power soft silencing your son.</p>

<p>After this cold considerance, sentence me,</p>

<p>And, as you are a king, speak in your state</p>

<p>What I have done that misbecame my place,</p>

<p>My person, or my liege’s sovereignty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>You are right, justice, and you weigh this well.</p>

<p>Therefore still bear the balance and the sword.</p>

<p>And I do wish your honors may increase</p>

<p>Till you do live to see a son of mine</p>

<p>Offend you and obey you as I did.</p>

<p>So shall I live to speak my father’s words:</p>

<p>“Happy am I that have a man so bold</p>

<p>That dares do justice on my proper son;</p>

<p>And not less happy, having such a son</p>

<p>That would deliver up his greatness so</p>

<p>Into the hands of justice.” You did commit me,</p>

<p>For which I do commit into your hand</p>

<p>Th’ unstained sword that you have used to bear,</p>

<p>With this remembrance: that you use the same</p>

<p>With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit</p>

<p>As you have done ’gainst me. There is my hand.</p>

<p><center><i>[They clasp hands.]</i></center></p>

<p>You shall be as a father to my youth,</p>

<p>My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,</p>

<p>And I will stoop and humble my intents</p>

<p>To your well-practiced wise directions.–</p>

<p>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you:</p>

<p>My father is gone wild into his grave,</p>

<p>For in his tomb lie my affections,</p>

<p>And with his spirits sadly I survive</p>

<p>To mock the expectation of the world,</p>

<p>To frustrate prophecies, and to raze out</p>

<p>Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down</p>

<p>After my seeming. The tide of blood in me</p>

<p>Hath proudly flowed in vanity till now.</p>

<p>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</p>

<p>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods</p>

<p>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</p>

<p>Now call we our high court of parliament,</p>

<p>And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel</p>

<p>That the great body of our state may go</p>

<p>In equal rank with the best-governed nation;</p>

<p>That war, or peace, or both at once, may be</p>

<p>As things acquainted and familiar to us,</p>

<p><i>[To the Chief Justice.]</i> In which you, father, shall</p>

<p>have foremost hand.</p>

<p>Our coronation done, we will accite,</p>

<p>As I before remembered, all our state.</p>

<p>And, God consigning to my good intents,</p>

<p>No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say</p>

<p>God shorten Harry’s happy life one day.</p>
