<p><center><i>[Enter the Lord Bardolph at one door.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span></p>

<p>Who keeps the gate here, ho?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Porter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Where is the Earl?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span></p>

<p>What shall I say you are?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Tell thou the Earl</p>

<p>That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span></p>

<p>His Lordship is walked forth into the orchard.</p>

<p>Please it your Honor knock but at the gate</p>

<p>And he himself will answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Earl Northumberland, his head wrapped in a</p>

<p>kerchief and supporting himself with a crutch.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Here comes the Earl.</p>

<p><center><i>[Porter exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>What news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute now</p>

<p>Should be the father of some stratagem.</p>

<p>The times are wild. Contention, like a horse</p>

<p>Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose</p>

<p>And bears down all before him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Noble earl,</p>

<p>I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Good, an God will!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  As good as heart can wish.</p>

<p>The King is almost wounded to the death,</p>

<p>And, in the fortune of my lord your son,</p>

<p>Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts</p>

<p>Killed by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John</p>

<p>And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;</p>

<p>And Harry Monmouth’s brawn, the hulk Sir John,</p>

<p>Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day,</p>

<p>So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,</p>

<p>Came not till now to dignify the times</p>

<p>Since Caesar’s fortunes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  How is this derived?</p>

<p>Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span></p>

<p>I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,</p>

<p>A gentleman well bred and of good name,</p>

<p>That freely rendered me these news for true.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Travers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Here comes my servant Travers, who I sent</p>

<p>On Tuesday last to listen after news.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span></p>

<p>My lord, I overrode him on the way,</p>

<p>And he is furnished with no certainties</p>

<p>More than he haply may retail from me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Travers</span></p>

<p>My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turned me back</p>

<p>With joyful tidings and, being better horsed,</p>

<p>Outrode me. After him came spurring hard</p>

<p>A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,</p>

<p>That stopped by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</p>

<p>He asked the way to Chester, and of him</p>

<p>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>He told me that rebellion had bad luck</p>

<p>And that young Harry Percy’s spur was cold.</p>

<p>With that he gave his able horse the head</p>

<p>And, bending forward, struck his armed heels</p>

<p>Against the panting sides of his poor jade</p>

<p>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</p>

<p>He seemed in running to devour the way,</p>

<p>Staying no longer question.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  Ha? Again:</p>

<p>Said he young Harry Percy’s spur was cold?</p>

<p>Of Hotspur, Coldspur? That rebellion</p>

<p>Had met ill luck?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  My lord, I’ll tell you what:</p>

<p>If my young lord your son have not the day,</p>

<p>Upon mine honor, for a silken point</p>

<p>I’ll give my barony. Never talk of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers</p>

<p>Give then such instances of loss?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Who, he?</p>

<p>He was some hilding fellow that had stol’n</p>

<p>The horse he rode on and, upon my life,</p>

<p>Spoke at a venture.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Morton.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look, here comes more news.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Yea, this man’s brow, like to a title leaf,</p>

<p>Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.</p>

<p>So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood</p>

<p>Hath left a witnessed usurpation.–</p>

<p>Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morton</span></p>

<p>I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord,</p>

<p>Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask</p>

<p>To fright our party.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  How doth my son and brother?</p>

<p>Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek</p>

<p>Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.</p>

<p>Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</p>

<p>So dull, so dead in look, so woebegone,</p>

<p>Drew Priam’s curtain in the dead of night</p>

<p>And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;</p>

<p>But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,</p>

<p>And I my Percy’s death ere thou report’st it.</p>

<p>This thou wouldst say: “Your son did thus and thus;</p>

<p>Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas”–</p>

<p>Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds.</p>

<p>But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,</p>

<p>Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,</p>

<p>Ending with “Brother, son, and all are dead.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morton</span></p>

<p>Douglas is living, and your brother yet,</p>

<p>But for my lord your son–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  Why, he is dead.</p>

<p>See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</p>

<p>He that but fears the thing he would not know</p>

<p>Hath, by instinct, knowledge from others’ eyes</p>

<p>That what he feared is chanced. Yet speak,</p>

<p>Morton.</p>

<p>Tell thou an earl his divination lies,</p>

<p>And I will take it as a sweet disgrace</p>

<p>And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morton</span></p>

<p>You are too great to be by me gainsaid,</p>

<p>Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Yet, for all this, say not that Percy’s dead.</p>

<p>I see a strange confession in thine eye.</p>

<p>Thou shak’st thy head and hold’st it fear or sin</p>

<p>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so.</p>

<p>The tongue offends not that reports his death;</p>

<p>And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,</p>

<p>Not he which says the dead is not alive.</p>

<p>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</p>

<p>Hath but a losing office, and his tongue</p>

<p>Sounds ever after as a sullen bell</p>

<p>Remembered tolling a departing friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span></p>

<p>I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morton</span> <i>[to Northumberland]</i></p>

<p>I am sorry I should force you to believe</p>

<p>That which I would to God I had not seen,</p>

<p>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</p>

<p>Rend’ring faint quittance, wearied and outbreathed,</p>

<p>To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down</p>

<p>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</p>

<p>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</p>

<p>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</p>

<p>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</p>

<p>Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</p>

<p>From the best-tempered courage in his troops;</p>

<p>For from his mettle was his party steeled,</p>

<p>Which, once in him abated, all the rest</p>

<p>Turned on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.</p>

<p>And as the thing that’s heavy in itself</p>

<p>Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,</p>

<p>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur’s loss,</p>

<p>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</p>

<p>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</p>

<p>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</p>

<p>Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester</p>

<p>So soon ta’en prisoner; and that furious Scot,</p>

<p>The bloody Douglas, whose well-laboring sword</p>

<p>Had three times slain th’ appearance of the King,</p>

<p>Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</p>

<p>Of those that turned their backs and in his flight,</p>

<p>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</p>

<p>Is that the King hath won and hath sent out</p>

<p>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</p>

<p>Under the conduct of young Lancaster</p>

<p>And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>For this I shall have time enough to mourn.</p>

<p>In poison there is physic, and these news,</p>

<p>Having been well, that would have made me sick,</p>

<p>Being sick, have in some measure made me well.</p>

<p>And as the wretch whose fever-weakened joints,</p>

<p>Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</p>

<p>Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire</p>

<p>Out of his keeper’s arms, even so my limbs,</p>

<p>Weakened with grief, being now enraged with</p>

<p>grief,</p>

<p>Are thrice themselves. Hence therefore, thou</p>

<p>nice crutch.     <i><i>[He throws down his crutch.]</i></i></p>

<p>A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel</p>

<p>Must glove this hand. And hence, thou sickly</p>

<p>coif.     <i><i>[He removes his kerchief.]</i></i></p>

<p>Thou art a guard too wanton for the head</p>

<p>Which princes, fleshed with conquest, aim to hit.</p>

<p>Now bind my brows with iron, and approach</p>

<p>The ragged’st hour that time and spite dare bring</p>

<p>To frown upon th’ enraged Northumberland.</p>

<p>Let heaven kiss Earth! Now let not Nature’s hand</p>

<p>Keep the wild flood confined. Let order die,</p>

<p>And let this world no longer be a stage</p>

<p>To feed contention in a lingering act;</p>

<p>But let one spirit of the firstborn Cain</p>

<p>Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set</p>

<p>On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,</p>

<p>And darkness be the burier of the dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span></p>

<p>This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morton</span></p>

<p>Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honor.</p>

<p>The lives of all your loving complices</p>

<p>Lean on your health, the which, if you give o’er</p>

<p>To stormy passion, must perforce decay.</p>

<p>You cast th’ event of war, my noble lord,</p>

<p>And summed the accompt of chance before you</p>

<p>said</p>

<p>“Let us make head.” It was your presurmise</p>

<p>That in the dole of blows your son might drop.</p>

<p>You knew he walked o’er perils on an edge,</p>

<p>More likely to fall in than to get o’er.</p>

<p>You were advised his flesh was capable</p>

<p>Of wounds and scars, and that his forward spirit</p>

<p>Would lift him where most trade of danger</p>

<p>ranged.</p>

<p>Yet did you say “Go forth,” and none of this,</p>

<p>Though strongly apprehended, could restrain</p>

<p>The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall’n,</p>

<p>Or what did this bold enterprise bring forth,</p>

<p>More than that being which was like to be?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span></p>

<p>We all that are engaged to this loss</p>

<p>Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas</p>

<p>That if we wrought out life, ’twas ten to one;</p>

<p>And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed</p>

<p>Choked the respect of likely peril feared;</p>

<p>And since we are o’erset, venture again.</p>

<p>Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morton</span></p>

<p>’Tis more than time.–And, my most noble lord,</p>

<p>I hear for certain, and dare speak the truth:</p>

<p>The gentle Archbishop of York is up</p>

<p>With well-appointed powers. He is a man</p>

<p>Who with a double surety binds his followers.</p>

<p>My lord your son had only but the corpse,</p>

<p>But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;</p>

<p>For that same word “rebellion” did divide</p>

<p>The action of their bodies from their souls,</p>

<p>And they did fight with queasiness, constrained,</p>

<p>As men drink potions, that their weapons only</p>

<p>Seemed on our side. But, for their spirits and</p>

<p>souls,</p>

<p>This word “rebellion,” it had froze them up</p>

<p>As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop</p>

<p>Turns insurrection to religion.</p>

<p>Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,</p>

<p>He’s followed both with body and with mind,</p>

<p>And doth enlarge his rising with the blood</p>

<p>Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret</p>

<p>stones;</p>

<p>Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;</p>

<p>Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,</p>

<p>Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;</p>

<p>And more and less do flock to follow him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>I knew of this before, but, to speak truth,</p>

<p>This present grief had wiped it from my mind.</p>

<p>Go in with me and counsel every man</p>

<p>The aptest way for safety and revenge.</p>

<p>Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed.</p>

<p>Never so few, and never yet more need.</p>
