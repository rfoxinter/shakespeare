<p><center><i>[Enter th’ Archbishop of York, Thomas Mowbray (Earl</p>

<p>Marshal), the Lord Hastings, and Lord Bardolph.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>Thus have you heard our cause and known our</p>

<p>means,</p>

<p>And, my most noble friends, I pray you all</p>

<p>Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes.</p>

<p>And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>I well allow the occasion of our arms,</p>

<p>But gladly would be better satisfied</p>

<p>How in our means we should advance ourselves</p>

<p>To look with forehead bold and big enough</p>

<p>Upon the power and puissance of the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Our present musters grow upon the file</p>

<p>To five-and-twenty thousand men of choice,</p>

<p>And our supplies live largely in the hope</p>

<p>Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns</p>

<p>With an incensed fire of injuries.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span></p>

<p>The question, then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:</p>

<p>Whether our present five-and-twenty thousand</p>

<p>May hold up head without Northumberland.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>With him we may.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Yea, marry, there’s the point.</p>

<p>But if without him we be thought too feeble,</p>

<p>My judgment is we should not step too far</p>

<p>Till we had his assistance by the hand.</p>

<p>For in a theme so bloody-faced as this,</p>

<p>Conjecture, expectation, and surmise</p>

<p>Of aids incertain should not be admitted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>’Tis very true, Lord Bardolph, for indeed</p>

<p>It was young Hotspur’s cause at Shrewsbury.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span></p>

<p>It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,</p>

<p>Eating the air and promise of supply,</p>

<p>Flatt’ring himself in project of a power</p>

<p>Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts,</p>

<p>And so, with great imagination</p>

<p>Proper to madmen, led his powers to death</p>

<p>And, winking, leapt into destruction.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt</p>

<p>To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span></p>

<p>Yes, if this present quality of war –</p>

<p>Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot–</p>

<p>Lives so in hope, as in an early spring</p>

<p>We see th’ appearing buds, which to prove fruit</p>

<p>Hope gives not so much warrant as despair</p>

<p>That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,</p>

<p>We first survey the plot, then draw the model,</p>

<p>And when we see the figure of the house,</p>

<p>Then must we rate the cost of the erection,</p>

<p>Which if we find outweighs ability,</p>

<p>What do we then but draw anew the model</p>

<p>In fewer offices, or at least desist</p>

<p>To build at all? Much more in this great work,</p>

<p>Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down</p>

<p>And set another up, should we survey</p>

<p>The plot of situation and the model,</p>

<p>Consent upon a sure foundation,</p>

<p>Question surveyors, know our own estate,</p>

<p>How able such a work to undergo,</p>

<p>To weigh against his opposite. Or else</p>

<p>We fortify in paper and in figures,</p>

<p>Using the names of men instead of men,</p>

<p>Like one that draws the model of an house</p>

<p>Beyond his power to build it, who, half through,</p>

<p>Gives o’er and leaves his part-created cost</p>

<p>A naked subject to the weeping clouds</p>

<p>And waste for churlish winter’s tyranny.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,</p>

<p>Should be stillborn and that we now possessed</p>

<p>The utmost man of expectation,</p>

<p>I think we are a body strong enough,</p>

<p>Even as we are, to equal with the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span></p>

<p>What, is the King but five-and-twenty thousand?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>To us no more, nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph,</p>

<p>For his divisions, as the times do brawl,</p>

<p>Are in three heads: one power against the French,</p>

<p>And one against Glendower; perforce a third</p>

<p>Must take up us. So is the unfirm king</p>

<p>In three divided, and his coffers sound</p>

<p>With hollow poverty and emptiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span></p>

<p>That he should draw his several strengths together</p>

<p>And come against us in full puissance</p>

<p>Need not to be dreaded.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span>  If he should do so,</p>

<p>He leaves his back unarmed, the French and Welsh</p>

<p>Baying him at the heels. Never fear that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <span class='sc'>Bardolph</span></p>

<p>Who is it like should lead his forces hither?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;</p>

<p>Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth;</p>

<p>But who is substituted against the French</p>

<p>I have no certain notice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archbishop</span>  Let us on,</p>

<p>And publish the occasion of our arms.</p>

<p>The commonwealth is sick of their own choice.</p>

<p>Their over-greedy love hath surfeited.</p>

<p>An habitation giddy and unsure</p>

<p>Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.</p>

<p>O thou fond many, with what loud applause</p>

<p>Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke</p>

<p>Before he was what thou wouldst have him be.</p>

<p>And being now trimmed in thine own desires,</p>

<p>Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him</p>

<p>That thou provok’st thyself to cast him up.</p>

<p>So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge</p>

<p>Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard,</p>

<p>And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up</p>

<p>And howl’st to find it. What trust is in these</p>

<p>times?</p>

<p>They that, when Richard lived, would have him die</p>

<p>Are now become enamored on his grave.</p>

<p>Thou, that threw’st dust upon his goodly head</p>

<p>When through proud London he came sighing on</p>

<p>After th’ admired heels of Bolingbroke,</p>

<p>Criest now “O earth, yield us that king again,</p>

<p>And take thou this!” O thoughts of men accursed!</p>

<p>Past and to come seems best; things present,</p>

<p>worst.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hastings</span></p>

<p>We are time’s subjects, and time bids begone.</p>
