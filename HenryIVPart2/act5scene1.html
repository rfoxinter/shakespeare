<p><center><i>[Enter Shallow, Falstaff, Page, and Bardolph.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away</p>

<p>tonight.–What, Davy, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  I will not excuse you. You shall not be</p>

<p>excused. Excuses shall not be admitted. There is no</p>

<p>excuse shall serve. You shall not be excused.–</p>

<p>Why, Davy!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Davy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Davy</span>  Here, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy, let</p>

<p>me see, Davy, let me see. Yea, marry, William cook,</p>

<p>bid him come hither.–Sir John, you shall not be</p>

<p>excused.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Davy</span>  Marry, sir, thus: those precepts cannot be served.</p>

<p>And again, sir: shall we sow the hade land with</p>

<p>wheat?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook,</p>

<p>are there no young pigeons?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Davy</span>  Yes, sir. Here is now the smith’s note for shoeing</p>

<p>and plow irons.     <i><i>[He gives Shallow a paper.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  Let it be cast and paid.–Sir John, you shall</p>

<p>not be excused.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Davy</span>  Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must needs be</p>

<p>had. And, sir, do you mean to stop any of William’s</p>

<p>wages about the sack he lost the other day at</p>

<p>Hinckley Fair?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  He shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a</p>

<p>couple of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and</p>

<p>any pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.</p>

<p><center><i>[Shallow and Davy walk aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Davy</span>  Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  Yea, Davy, I will use him well. A friend i’ th’</p>

<p>court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men</p>

<p>well, Davy, for they are arrant knaves and will</p>

<p>backbite.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Davy</span>  No worse than they are back-bitten, sir, for they</p>

<p>have marvelous foul linen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  Well-conceited, Davy. About thy business,</p>

<p>Davy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Davy</span>  I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor</p>

<p>of Woncot against Clement Perkes o’ th’ hill.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  There is many complaints, Davy, against that</p>

<p>Visor. That Visor is an arrant knave, on my</p>

<p>knowledge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Davy</span>  I grant your Worship that he is a knave, sir, but</p>

<p>yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some</p>

<p>countenance at his friend’s request. An honest</p>

<p>man, sir, is able to speak for himself when a knave is</p>

<p>not. I have served your Worship truly, sir, this eight</p>

<p>years; an I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear</p>

<p>out a knave against an honest man, I have but a</p>

<p>very little credit with your Worship. The knave is</p>

<p>mine honest friend, sir; therefore I beseech you let</p>

<p>him be countenanced.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  Go to, I say, he shall have no wrong. Look</p>

<p>about, Davy. <i>[Davy exits.]</i> Where are you, Sir John?</p>

<p>Come, come, come, off with your boots.–Give me</p>

<p>your hand, Master Bardolph.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  I am glad to see your Worship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span>  I thank thee with all my heart, kind Master</p>

<p>Bardolph, <i>[(to Page)]</i> and welcome, my tall</p>

<p>fellow.–Come, Sir John.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  I’ll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.</p>

<p><i>[Shallow exits.]</i> Bardolph, look to our horses. <i>[Bardolph</p>

<p>and Page exit.]</i> If I were sawed into quantities,</p>

<p>I should make four dozen of such bearded hermits’</p>

<p>staves as Master Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to</p>

<p>see the semblable coherence of his men’s spirits</p>

<p>and his. They, by observing of him, do bear</p>

<p>themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing</p>

<p>with them, is turned into a justice-like servingman.</p>

<p>Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the</p>

<p>participation of society that they flock together in</p>

<p>consent like so many wild geese. If I had a suit to</p>

<p>Master Shallow, I would humor his men with the</p>

<p>imputation of being near their master; if to his men,</p>

<p>I would curry with Master Shallow that no man</p>

<p>could better command his servants. It is certain</p>

<p>that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is</p>

<p>caught, as men take diseases, one of another. Therefore</p>

<p>let men take heed of their company. I will</p>

<p>devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep</p>

<p>Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out</p>

<p>of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions,</p>

<p>and he shall laugh without intervallums. O, it is</p>

<p>much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a</p>

<p>sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the</p>

<p>ache in his shoulders. O, you shall see him laugh till</p>

<p>his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shallow</span> <i>[within]</i>  Sir John.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Falstaff</span>  I come, Master Shallow, I come, Master</p>

<p>Shallow.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
