<p><center><i>[Enter the Prince and Poins.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Before God, I am exceeding weary.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Is ’t come to that? I had thought weariness durst</p>

<p>not have attached one of so high blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Faith, it does me, though it discolors the complexion</p>

<p>of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it</p>

<p>not show vilely in me to desire small beer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied</p>

<p>as to remember so weak a composition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Belike then my appetite was not princely got,</p>

<p>for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor</p>

<p>creature small beer. But indeed these humble considerations</p>

<p>make me out of love with my greatness.</p>

<p>What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name,</p>

<p>or to know thy face tomorrow, or to take note how</p>

<p>many pair of silk stockings thou hast–with these,</p>

<p>and those that were thy peach-colored ones–or to</p>

<p>bear the inventory of thy shirts, as, one for superfluity</p>

<p>and another for use. But that the tennis-court</p>

<p>keeper knows better than I, for it is a low ebb of</p>

<p>linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there,</p>

<p>as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest</p>

<p>of the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy</p>

<p>holland; and God knows whether those that bawl</p>

<p>out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit His kingdom;</p>

<p>but the midwives say the children are not in the</p>

<p>fault, whereupon the world increases and kindreds</p>

<p>are mightily strengthened.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  How ill it follows, after you have labored so</p>

<p>hard, you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many</p>

<p>good young princes would do so, their fathers being</p>

<p>so sick as yours at this time is?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Yes, faith, and let it be an excellent good thing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding</p>

<p>than thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Go to. I stand the push of your one thing that</p>

<p>you will tell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Marry, I tell thee it is not meet that I should be</p>

<p>sad, now my father is sick–albeit I could tell to</p>

<p>thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to</p>

<p>call my friend, I could be sad, and sad indeed too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Very hardly, upon such a subject.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the</p>

<p>devil’s book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and</p>

<p>persistency. Let the end try the man. But I tell thee,</p>

<p>my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick;</p>

<p>and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in</p>

<p>reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  The reason?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What wouldst thou think of me if I should</p>

<p>weep?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  It would be every man’s thought, and thou art</p>

<p>a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks. Never</p>

<p>a man’s thought in the world keeps the roadway</p>

<p>better than thine. Every man would think me an</p>

<p>hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful</p>

<p>thought to think so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Why, because you have been so lewd and so</p>

<p>much engraffed to Falstaff.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  And to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  By this light, I am well spoke on. I can hear it</p>

<p>with mine own ears. The worst that they can say of</p>

<p>me is that I am a second brother, and that I am a</p>

<p>proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I</p>

<p>confess, I cannot help. By the Mass, here comes</p>

<p>Bardolph.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bardolph and Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  And the boy that I gave Falstaff. He had him</p>

<p>from me Christian, and look if the fat villain have</p>

<p>not transformed him ape.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  God save your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  And yours, most noble Bardolph.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc> <i>[to Bardolph]</i>  Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful</p>

<p>fool, must you be blushing? Wherefore blush</p>

<p>you now? What a maidenly man-at-arms are you</p>

<p>become! Is ’t such a matter to get a pottle-pot’s</p>

<p>maidenhead?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  He calls me e’en now, my lord, through a red</p>

<p>lattice, and I could discern no part of his face from</p>

<p>the window. At last I spied his eyes, and methought</p>

<p>he had made two holes in the ale-wife’s new</p>

<p>petticoat and so peeped through.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Has not the boy profited?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc> <i>[to Page]</i>  Away, you whoreson upright rabbit,</p>

<p>away!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Away, you rascally Althea’s dream, away!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Instruct us, boy. What dream, boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Marry, my lord, Althea dreamt she was delivered</p>

<p>of a firebrand, and therefore I call him her dream.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  A crown’s worth of good interpretation. There</p>

<p>’tis, boy.     <i><i>[He gives the Page money.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  O, that this good blossom could be kept from</p>

<p>cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives the Page money.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  An you do not make him be hanged among</p>

<p>you, the gallows shall have wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  And how doth thy master, Bardolph?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Well, my good lord. He heard of your</p>

<p>Grace’s coming to town. There’s a letter for you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives the Prince a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Delivered with good respect. And how doth the</p>

<p>Martlemas your master?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  In bodily health, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Marry, the immortal part needs a physician, but</p>

<p>that moves not him. Though that be sick, it dies not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as</p>

<p>my dog, and he holds his place, for look you how he</p>

<p>writes.     <i><i>[He shows the letter to Poins.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc> <i>[reads the superscription]</i>  John Falstaff, knight.</p>

<p>Every man must know that as oft as he has occasion</p>

<p>to name himself, even like those that are kin to the</p>

<p>King, for they never prick their finger but they say</p>

<p>“There’s some of the King’s blood spilt.” “How</p>

<p>comes that?” says he that takes upon him not to</p>

<p>conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower’s</p>

<p>cap: “I am the King’s poor cousin, sir.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it</p>

<p>from Japheth. But to the letter: <i>[Reads.]</i> Sir John</p>

<p>Falstaff, knight, to the son of the King nearest his</p>

<p>father, Harry Prince of Wales, greeting.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Why, this is a certificate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Peace!</p>

<p><i>[Reads.]</i> I will imitate the honorable Romans in</p>

<p>brevity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  He sure means brevity in breath, short-winded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[reads]</i>  I commend me to thee, I commend thee,</p>

<p>and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with Poins, for he</p>

<p>misuses thy favors so much that he swears thou art to</p>

<p>marry his sister Nell. Repent at idle times as thou</p>

<p>mayst, and so farewell.</p>

<p>     <i>Thine by yea and no, which is as much as</i></p>

<p>to say, as thou usest him,</p>

<p>Jack Falstaff with my familiars,</p>

<p>John with my brothers and sisters, and</p>

<p>Sir John with all Europe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  My lord, I’ll steep this letter in sack and make</p>

<p>him eat it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  That’s to make him eat twenty of his words.</p>

<p>But do you use me thus, Ned? Must I marry your</p>

<p>sister?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  God send the wench no worse fortune! But I</p>

<p>never said so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and</p>

<p>the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.</p>

<p><i>[To Bardolph.]</i> Is your master here in London?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Yea, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Where sups he? Doth the old boar feed in the</p>

<p>old frank?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What company?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Sup any women with him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and</p>

<p>Mistress Doll Tearsheet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What pagan may that be?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of</p>

<p>my master’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the</p>

<p>town bull.–Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at</p>

<p>supper?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  I am your shadow, my lord. I’ll follow you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Sirrah–you, boy–and Bardolph, no word to</p>

<p>your master that I am yet come to town. There’s for</p>

<p>your silence.     <i><i>[He gives money.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  I have no tongue, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  And for mine, sir, I will govern it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Fare you well. Go.     <i><i>[Bardolph and Page exit.]</i></i></p>

<p>This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  I warrant you, as common as the way between</p>

<p>Saint Albans and London.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  How might we see Falstaff bestow himself</p>

<p>tonight in his true colors, and not ourselves be</p>

<p>seen?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and</p>

<p>wait upon him at his table as drawers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  From a god to a bull: a heavy descension. It</p>

<p>was Jove’s case. From a prince to a ’prentice: a low</p>

<p>transformation that shall be mine, for in everything</p>

<p>the purpose must weigh with the folly. Follow me,</p>

<p>Ned.</p>
