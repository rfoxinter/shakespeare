<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff, with his Page bearing his sword</p>

<p>and buckler.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my</p>

<p>water?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy</p>

<p>water, but, for the party that owed it, he might have</p>

<p>more diseases than he knew for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me.</p>

<p>The brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is</p>

<p>not able to invent anything that intends to laughter</p>

<p>more than I invent, or is invented on me. I am not</p>

<p>only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in</p>

<p>other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow</p>

<p>that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the</p>

<p>Prince put thee into my service for any other reason</p>

<p>than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.</p>

<p>Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be</p>

<p>worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never</p>

<p>manned with an agate till now, but I will inset you</p>

<p>neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and</p>

<p>send you back again to your master for a jewel. The</p>

<p>juvenal, the Prince your master, whose chin is not</p>

<p>yet fledge–I will sooner have a beard grow in the</p>

<p>palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek,</p>

<p>and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face</p>

<p>royal. God may finish it when He will. ’Tis not a hair</p>

<p>amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face royal, for a</p>

<p>barber shall never earn sixpence out of it, and yet</p>

<p>he’ll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his</p>

<p>father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace,</p>

<p>but he’s almost out of mine, I can assure him. What</p>

<p>said Master Dommelton about the satin for my</p>

<p>short cloak and my slops?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  He said, sir, you should procure him better</p>

<p>assurance than Bardolph. He would not take his</p>

<p>band and yours. He liked not the security.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Let him be damned like the glutton! Pray</p>

<p>God his tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel, a</p>

<p>rascally yea-forsooth knave, to bear a gentleman in</p>

<p>hand and then stand upon security! The whoreson</p>

<p>smoothy-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes</p>

<p>and bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is</p>

<p>through with them in honest taking up, then they</p>

<p>must stand upon security. I had as lief they would</p>

<p>put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with</p>

<p>“security.” I looked he should have sent me two-and-twenty</p>

<p>yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and</p>

<p>he sends me “security.” Well, he may sleep in</p>

<p>security, for he hath the horn of abundance, and the</p>

<p>lightness of his wife shines through it, and yet</p>

<p>cannot he see though he have his own lantern to</p>

<p>light him. Where’s Bardolph?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  He’s gone in Smithfield to buy your Worship a</p>

<p>horse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I bought him in Paul’s, and he’ll buy me a</p>

<p>horse in Smithfield. An I could get me but a wife in</p>

<p>the stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Chief Justice and Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc> <i>[to Falstaff]</i>  Sir, here comes the nobleman that</p>

<p>committed the Prince for striking him about</p>

<p>Bardolph.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Wait close. I will not see him.</p>

<p><center><i>[They begin to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc> <i>[to Servant]</i>  What’s he that goes there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  Falstaff, an ’t please your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  He that was in question for the robbery?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  He, my lord; but he hath since done good</p>

<p>service at Shrewsbury, and, as I hear, is now going</p>

<p>with some charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  What, to York? Call him back again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  Sir John Falstaff!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Boy, tell him I am deaf.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  You must speak louder. My master is deaf.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  I am sure he is, to the hearing of</p>

<p>anything good.–Go pluck him by the elbow. I must</p>

<p>speak with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc> <i>[plucking Falstaff’s sleeve]</i>  Sir John!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What, a young knave and begging? Is there</p>

<p>not wars? Is there not employment? Doth not the</p>

<p>King lack subjects? Do not the rebels need soldiers?</p>

<p>Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it is</p>

<p>worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,</p>

<p>were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell</p>

<p>how to make it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  You mistake me, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Why sir, did I say you were an honest man?</p>

<p>Setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I</p>

<p>had lied in my throat if I had said so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and</p>

<p>your soldiership aside, and give me leave to tell you,</p>

<p>you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than</p>

<p>an honest man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I give thee leave to tell me so? I lay aside that</p>

<p>which grows to me? If thou gett’st any leave of me,</p>

<p>hang me; if thou tak’st leave, thou wert better be</p>

<p>hanged. You hunt counter. Hence! Avaunt!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  Sir, my lord would speak with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  My good lord. God give your Lordship good</p>

<p>time of the day. I am glad to see your Lordship</p>

<p>abroad. I heard say your Lordship was sick. I hope</p>

<p>your Lordship goes abroad by advice. Your Lordship,</p>

<p>though not clean past your youth, have yet</p>

<p>some smack of an ague in you, some relish of the</p>

<p>saltness of time in you, and I most humbly beseech</p>

<p>your Lordship to have a reverend care of your</p>

<p>health.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Sir John, I sent for you before your</p>

<p>expedition to Shrewsbury.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  An ’t please your Lordship, I hear his Majesty</p>

<p>is returned with some discomfort from Wales.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  I talk not of his Majesty. You would not</p>

<p>come when I sent for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  And I hear, moreover, his Highness is fallen</p>

<p>into this same whoreson apoplexy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Well, God mend him. I pray you let me</p>

<p>speak with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of</p>

<p>lethargy, an ’t please your Lordship, a kind of</p>

<p>sleeping in the blood, a whoreson tingling.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  What tell you me of it? Be it as it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  It hath it original from much grief, from</p>

<p>study, and perturbation of the brain. I have read the</p>

<p>cause of his effects in Galen. It is a kind of deafness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  I think you are fallen into the disease,</p>

<p>for you hear not what I say to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Very well, my lord, very well. Rather, an ’t</p>

<p>please you, it is the disease of not listening, the</p>

<p>malady of not marking, that I am troubled withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  To punish you by the heels would amend</p>

<p>the attention of your ears, and I care not if I do</p>

<p>become your physician.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so</p>

<p>patient. Your Lordship may minister the potion of</p>

<p>imprisonment to me in respect of poverty, but how</p>

<p>I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions,</p>

<p>the wise may make some dram of a scruple,</p>

<p>or indeed a scruple itself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  I sent for you, when there were matters</p>

<p>against you for your life, to come speak with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  As I was then advised by my learned counsel</p>

<p>in the laws of this land-service, I did not come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in</p>

<p>great infamy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  He that buckles himself in my belt cannot</p>

<p>live in less.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Your means are very slender, and your</p>

<p>waste is great.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I would it were otherwise. I would my means</p>

<p>were greater and my waist slender.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  You have misled the youthful prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  The young prince hath misled me. I am the</p>

<p>fellow with the great belly, and he my dog.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed</p>

<p>wound. Your day’s service at Shrewsbury hath a</p>

<p>little gilded over your night’s exploit on Gad’s Hill.</p>

<p>You may thank th’ unquiet time for your quiet</p>

<p>o’erposting that action.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  My lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  But since all is well, keep it so. Wake not</p>

<p>a sleeping wolf.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  What, you are as a candle, the better</p>

<p>part burnt out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow. If I did</p>

<p>say of wax, my growth would approve the truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  There is not a white hair in your face but</p>

<p>should have his effect of gravity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  You follow the young prince up and</p>

<p>down like his ill angel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Not so, my lord. Your ill angel is light, but I</p>

<p>hope he that looks upon me will take me without</p>

<p>weighing. And yet in some respects I grant I cannot</p>

<p>go. I cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these</p>

<p>costermongers’ times that true valor is turned bearherd;</p>

<p>pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath his</p>

<p>quick wit wasted in giving reckonings. All the other</p>

<p>gifts appurtenant to man, as the malice of this age</p>

<p>shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry. You that</p>

<p>are old consider not the capacities of us that are</p>

<p>young. You do measure the heat of our livers with</p>

<p>the bitterness of your galls, and we that are in the</p>

<p>vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Do you set down your name in the scroll</p>

<p>of youth, that are written down old with all the</p>

<p>characters of age? Have you not a moist eye, a dry</p>

<p>hand, a yellow cheek, a white beard, a decreasing</p>

<p>leg, an increasing belly? Is not your voice broken,</p>

<p>your wind short, your chin double, your wit single,</p>

<p>and every part about you blasted with antiquity?</p>

<p>And will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir</p>

<p>John.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  My lord, I was born about three of the clock</p>

<p>in the afternoon, with a white head and something</p>

<p>a round belly. For my voice, I have lost it with</p>

<p>halloing and singing of anthems. To approve my</p>

<p>youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am only old</p>

<p>in judgment and understanding. And he that will</p>

<p>caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend</p>

<p>me the money, and have at him. For the box of the</p>

<p>ear that the Prince gave you, he gave it like a rude</p>

<p>prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have</p>

<p>checked him for it, and the young lion repents.</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> Marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in</p>

<p>new silk and old sack.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Well, God send the Prince a better</p>

<p>companion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  God send the companion a better prince. I</p>

<p>cannot rid my hands of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Well, the King hath severed you and</p>

<p>Prince Harry. I hear you are going with Lord John</p>

<p>of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of</p>

<p>Northumberland.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Yea, I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But</p>

<p>look you pray, all you that kiss my Lady Peace at</p>

<p>home, that our armies join not in a hot day, for, by</p>

<p>the Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I</p>

<p>mean not to sweat extraordinarily. If it be a hot day</p>

<p>and I brandish anything but a bottle, I would I</p>

<p>might never spit white again. There is not a dangerous</p>

<p>action can peep out his head but I am thrust</p>

<p>upon it. Well, I cannot last ever. But it was always</p>

<p>yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a</p>

<p>good thing, to make it too common. If you will</p>

<p>needs say I am an old man, you should give me rest.</p>

<p>I would to God my name were not so terrible to the</p>

<p>enemy as it is. I were better to be eaten to death</p>

<p>with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with</p>

<p>perpetual motion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Well, be honest, be honest, and God</p>

<p>bless your expedition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Will your Lordship lend me a thousand</p>

<p>pound to furnish me forth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chief</sc> <sc>Justice</sc>  Not a penny, not a penny. You are too</p>

<p>impatient to bear crosses. Fare you well. Commend</p>

<p>me to my cousin Westmoreland.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lord Chief Justice and his Servant exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A</p>

<p>man can no more separate age and covetousness</p>

<p>than he can part young limbs and lechery; but the</p>

<p>gout galls the one, and the pox pinches the other,</p>

<p>and so both the degrees prevent my curses.–Boy!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  What money is in my purse?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Seven groats and two pence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  I can get no remedy against this consumption</p>

<p>of the purse. Borrowing only lingers and lingers</p>

<p>it out, but the disease is incurable. <i>[Giving</p>

<p>papers to the Page.]</i> Go bear this letter to my Lord</p>

<p>of Lancaster, this to the Prince, this to the Earl</p>

<p>of Westmoreland, and this to old Mistress Ursula,</p>

<p>whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I perceived</p>

<p>the first white hair of my chin. About it. You</p>

<p>know where to find me. <i>[Page exits.]</i> A pox of this</p>

<p>gout! Or a gout of this pox, for the one or the other</p>

<p>plays the rogue with my great toe. ’Tis no matter if I</p>

<p>do halt. I have the wars for my color, and my</p>

<p>pension shall seem the more reasonable. A good wit</p>

<p>will make use of anything. I will turn diseases to</p>

<p>commodity.</p>
