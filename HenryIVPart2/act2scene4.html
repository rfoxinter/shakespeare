<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  What the devil hast thou brought there–</p>

<p>applejohns? Thou knowest Sir John cannot endure</p>

<p>an applejohn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Drawer</sc>  Mass, thou sayst true. The Prince</p>

<p>once set a dish of applejohns before him and told</p>

<p>him there were five more Sir Johns and, putting off</p>

<p>his hat, said “I will now take my leave of these six</p>

<p>dry, round, old, withered knights.” It angered him</p>

<p>to the heart. But he hath forgot that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  Why then, cover and set them down, and see if</p>

<p>thou canst find out Sneak’s noise. Mistress Tearsheet</p>

<p>would fain hear some music. Dispatch. The</p>

<p>room where they supped is too hot. They’ll come in</p>

<p>straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Will.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Will</sc>  Sirrah, here will be the Prince and Master</p>

<p>Poins anon, and they will put on two of our jerkins</p>

<p>and aprons, and Sir John must not know of it.</p>

<p>Bardolph hath brought word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Drawer</sc>  By the Mass, here will be old utis. It</p>

<p>will be an excellent stratagem.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francis</sc>  I’ll see if I can find out Sneak.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with the Second Drawer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hostess and Doll Tearsheet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  I’ faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in</p>

<p>an excellent good temperality. Your pulsidge beats</p>

<p>as extraordinarily as heart would desire, and your</p>

<p>color, I warrant you, is as red as any rose, in good</p>

<p>truth, la. But, i’ faith, you have drunk too much</p>

<p>canaries, and that’s a marvellous searching wine,</p>

<p>and it perfumes the blood ere one can say “What’s</p>

<p>this?” How do you now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  Better than I was. Hem.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Why, that’s well said. A good heart’s worth</p>

<p>gold. Lo, here comes Sir John.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Falstaff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[singing]</i></p>

<p>When Arthur first in court–</p>

<p><center><i>[To Will.]</i></center> Empty the jordan.     <i><center><i>[Will exits.]</i></center></i></p>

<p>And was a worthy king–</p>

<p>How now, Mistress Doll?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Sick of a calm, yea, good faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  So is all her sect. An they be once in a calm,</p>

<p>they are sick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  A pox damn you, you muddy rascal. Is that all the</p>

<p>comfort you give me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  I make them? Gluttony and diseases make them;</p>

<p>I make them not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  If the cook help to make the gluttony, you</p>

<p>help to make the diseases, Doll. We catch of you,</p>

<p>Doll, we catch of you. Grant that, my poor virtue,</p>

<p>grant that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Your brooches, pearls, and ouches–for to</p>

<p>serve bravely is to come halting off, you know; to</p>

<p>come off the breach with his pike bent bravely, and</p>

<p>to surgery bravely, to venture upon the charged</p>

<p>chambers bravely–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  By my troth, this is the old fashion. You two</p>

<p>never meet but you fall to some discord. You are</p>

<p>both, i’ good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts.</p>

<p>You cannot one bear with another’s confirmities.</p>

<p>What the good-year! One must bear, and <i>[to Doll]</i></p>

<p>that must be you. You are the weaker vessel, as they</p>

<p>say, the emptier vessel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full</p>

<p>hogshead? There’s a whole merchant’s venture of</p>

<p>Bordeaux stuff in him. You have not seen a hulk</p>

<p>better stuffed in the hold.–Come, I’ll be friends</p>

<p>with thee, Jack. Thou art going to the wars, and</p>

<p>whether I shall ever see thee again or no, there is</p>

<p>nobody cares.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Drawer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Drawer</sc>  Sir, Ancient Pistol’s below and would speak</p>

<p>with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  Hang him, swaggering rascal! Let him not come</p>

<p>hither. It is the foul-mouthed’st rogue in England.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  If he swagger, let him not come here. No, by</p>

<p>my faith, I must live among my neighbors. I’ll no</p>

<p>swaggerers. I am in good name and fame with the</p>

<p>very best. Shut the door. There comes no swaggerers</p>

<p>here. I have not lived all this while to have</p>

<p>swaggering now. Shut the door, I pray you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Dost thou hear, hostess?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Pray you pacify yourself, Sir John. There</p>

<p>comes no swaggerers here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Dost thou hear? It is mine ancient.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Tilly-vally, Sir John, ne’er tell me. And your</p>

<p>ancient swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was</p>

<p>before Master Tisick the debuty t’ other day, and, as</p>

<p>he said to me–’twas no longer ago than Wednesday</p>

<p>last, i’ good faith–“Neighbor Quickly,” says</p>

<p>he–Master Dumb, our minister, was by then–</p>

<p>“Neighbor Quickly,” says he, “receive those that</p>

<p>are civil, for,” said he, “you are in an ill name.”</p>

<p>Now he said so, I can tell whereupon. “For,” says</p>

<p>he, “you are an honest woman, and well thought</p>

<p>on. Therefore take heed what guests you receive.</p>

<p>Receive,” says he, “no swaggering companions.”</p>

<p>There comes none here. You would bless you to</p>

<p>hear what he said. No, I’ll no swaggerers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  He’s no swaggerer, hostess, a tame cheater, i’</p>

<p>faith. You may stroke him as gently as a puppy</p>

<p>greyhound. He’ll not swagger with a Barbary hen if</p>

<p>her feathers turn back in any show of resistance.–</p>

<p>Call him up, drawer.     <i><i>[Drawer exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  “Cheater” call you him? I will bar no honest</p>

<p>man my house, nor no cheater, but I do not love</p>

<p>swaggering. By my troth, I am the worse when one</p>

<p>says “swagger.” Feel, masters, how I shake; look</p>

<p>you, I warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  So you do, hostess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Do I? Yea, in very truth, do I, an ’twere an</p>

<p>aspen leaf. I cannot abide swaggerers.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ancient Pistol, Bardolph, and Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  God save you, Sir John.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I</p>

<p>charge you with a cup of sack. Do you discharge</p>

<p>upon mine hostess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two</p>

<p>bullets.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  She is pistol-proof. Sir, you shall not hardly</p>

<p>offend her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Come, I’ll drink no proofs nor no bullets. I’ll</p>

<p>drink no more than will do me good, for no man’s</p>

<p>pleasure, I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Then, to you, Mistress Dorothy! I will charge</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  Charge me? I scorn you, scurvy companion.</p>

<p>What, you poor, base, rascally, cheating lack-linen</p>

<p>mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for</p>

<p>your master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  I know you, Mistress Dorothy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  Away, you cutpurse rascal, you filthy bung, away!</p>

<p>By this wine, I’ll thrust my knife in your mouldy</p>

<p>chaps an you play the saucy cuttle with me. Away,</p>

<p>you bottle-ale rascal, you basket-hilt stale juggler,</p>

<p>you. Since when, I pray you, sir? God’s light, with</p>

<p>two points on your shoulder? Much!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  God let me not live but I will murder your ruff</p>

<p>for this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  No more, Pistol. I would not have you go off</p>

<p>here. Discharge yourself of our company, Pistol.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  No, good Captain Pistol, not here, sweet</p>

<p>captain!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  Captain? Thou abominable damned cheater, art</p>

<p>thou not ashamed to be called captain? An captains</p>

<p>were of my mind, they would truncheon you out for</p>

<p>taking their names upon you before you have</p>

<p>earned them. You a captain? You slave, for what?</p>

<p>For tearing a poor whore’s ruff in a bawdy house?</p>

<p>He a captain! Hang him, rogue. He lives upon</p>

<p>mouldy stewed prunes and dried cakes. A captain?</p>

<p>God’s light, these villains will make the word as</p>

<p>odious as the word “occupy,” which was an excellent</p>

<p>good word before it was ill sorted. Therefore</p>

<p>captains had need look to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc> <i>[to Pistol]</i>  Pray thee go down, good ancient.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc> <i>[to Bardolph]</i>  Not I. I tell thee what, Corporal</p>

<p>Bardolph, I could tear her. I’ll be revenged of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc>  Pray thee go down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  I’ll see her damned first to Pluto’s damned</p>

<p>lake, by this hand, to th’ infernal deep with Erebus</p>

<p>and tortures vile also. Hold hook and line, say I.</p>

<p>Down, down, dogs! Down, Fates! Have we not</p>

<p>Hiren here?     <i><i>[He draws his sword.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Good Captain Peesell, be quiet. ’Tis very late,</p>

<p>i’ faith. I beseek you now, aggravate your choler.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  These be good humors indeed. Shall pack-horses</p>

<p>and hollow pampered jades of Asia, which</p>

<p>cannot go but thirty mile a day, compare with</p>

<p>Caesars and with cannibals and Troyant Greeks?</p>

<p>Nay, rather damn them with King Cerberus, and let</p>

<p>the welkin roar. Shall we fall foul for toys?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  By my troth, captain, these are very bitter</p>

<p>words.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Begone, good ancient. This will grow to a</p>

<p>brawl anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Die men like dogs! Give crowns like pins! Have</p>

<p>we not Hiren here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  O’ my word, captain, there’s none such here.</p>

<p>What the good-year, do you think I would deny her?</p>

<p>For God’s sake, be quiet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Then feed and be fat, my fair Calipolis. Come,</p>

<p>give ’s some sack. Si fortune me tormente, sperato</p>

<p>me contento. Fear we broadsides? No, let the fiend</p>

<p>give fire. Give me some sack, and, sweetheart, lie</p>

<p>thou there. <i>[Laying down his sword.]</i> Come we to</p>

<p>full points here? And are etceteras nothings?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Pistol, I would be quiet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf. What, we have</p>

<p>seen the seven stars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  For God’s sake, thrust him downstairs. I cannot</p>

<p>endure such a fustian rascal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  “Thrust him downstairs”? Know we not Galloway</p>

<p>nags?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat</p>

<p>shilling. Nay, an he do nothing but speak</p>

<p>nothing, he shall be nothing here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Come, get you downstairs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc> <i>[taking up his sword]</i>  What, shall we have</p>

<p>incision? Shall we imbrue? Then death rock me</p>

<p>asleep, abridge my doleful days. Why then, let</p>

<p>grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds untwind the Sisters</p>

<p>Three. Come, Atropos, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Here’s goodly stuff toward!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Give me my rapier, boy.</p>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[to Pistol]</i>  Get you downstairs.     <i><i>[They fight.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Here’s a goodly tumult. I’ll forswear keeping</p>

<p>house afore I’ll be in these tirrits and frights. So,</p>

<p>murder, I warrant now. Alas, alas, put up your</p>

<p>naked weapons, put up your naked weapons.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc> <i>[to Falstaff]</i>  Are you not hurt i’ th’ groin?</p>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Yea, sir. The rascal’s drunk. You have hurt</p>

<p>him, sir, i’ th’ shoulder.</p>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  Ah, you sweet little rogue, you. Alas, poor ape,</p>

<p>how thou sweat’st! Come, let me wipe thy face.</p>

<p>Come on, you whoreson chops. Ah, rogue, i’ faith, I</p>

<p>love thee. Thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy,</p>

<p>worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better</p>

<p>than the Nine Worthies. Ah, villain!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Ah, rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a</p>

<p>blanket.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  Do, an thou darest for thy heart. An thou dost, I’ll</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Peace, good Doll. Do not speak like a death’s-head;</p>

<p>do not bid me remember mine end.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  Sirrah, what humor’s the Prince of?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  A good shallow young fellow, he would have</p>

<p>made a good pantler; he would ’a chipped bread</p>

<p>well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  They say Poins has a good wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  He a good wit? Hang him, baboon. His wit’s</p>

<p>as thick as Tewkesbury mustard. There’s no more</p>

<p>conceit in him than is in a mallet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  Why does the Prince love him so then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Because their legs are both of a bigness, and</p>

<p>he plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel,</p>

<p>and drinks off candles’ ends for flap-dragons, and</p>

<p>rides the wild mare with the boys, and jumps upon</p>

<p>joint stools, and swears with a good grace, and</p>

<p>wears his boots very smooth like unto the sign of</p>

<p>the Leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet</p>

<p>stories, and such other gambol faculties he has that</p>

<p>show a weak mind and an able body, for the which</p>

<p>the Prince admits him; for the Prince himself is</p>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  No abuse?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  No abuse, Ned, i’ th’ world, honest Ned,</p>

<p>none. No, faith, boys, none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  See now whether pure fear and entire cowardice</p>

<p>doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman</p>

<p>to close with us. Is she of the wicked, is</p>

<p>thine hostess here of the wicked, or is thy boy of the</p>

<p>wicked, or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in</p>

<p>his nose, of the wicked?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poins</sc>  Answer, thou dead elm, answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable,</p>

<p>and his face is Lucifer’s privy kitchen,</p>

<p>where he doth nothing but roast malt-worms. For</p>

<p>the boy, there is a good angel about him, but the</p>

<p>devil blinds him too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  For the women?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  For one of them, she’s in hell already and</p>

<p>burns poor souls. For th’ other, I owe her money,</p>

<p>and whether she be damned for that I know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  No, I warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  No, I think thou art not. I think thou art quit</p>

<p>for that. Marry, there is another indictment upon</p>

<p>thee for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house</p>

<p>contrary to the law, for the which I think thou wilt</p>

<p>howl.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  All vitlars do so. What’s a joint of mutton or</p>

<p>two in a whole Lent?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[to Doll]</i>  You, gentlewoman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  What says your Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  His grace says that which his flesh rebels</p>

<p>against.</p>

<p><center><i>[Peto knocks at door.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Who knocks so loud at door? Look to th’ door</p>

<p>there, Francis.     <i><i>[Francis exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Peto.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Peto, how now, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Peto</sc></p>

<p>The King your father is at Westminster,</p>

<p>And there are twenty weak and wearied posts</p>

<p>Come from the north, and as I came along</p>

<p>I met and overtook a dozen captains,</p>

<p>Bareheaded, sweating, knocking at the taverns</p>

<p>And asking everyone for Sir John Falstaff.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame</p>

<p>So idly to profane the precious time</p>

<p>When tempest of commotion, like the south</p>

<p>Borne with black vapor, doth begin to melt</p>

<p>And drop upon our bare unarmed heads.–</p>

<p>Give me my sword and cloak.–Falstaff, good</p>

<p>night.     <i><i>[Prince, Peto, and Poins exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the</p>

<p>night, and we must hence and leave it unpicked.</p>

<br/>

<p><i>[(Knocking. Bardolph exits.)]</i> More knocking at the</p>

<p>door? <i>[(Bardolph returns.)]</i> How now, what’s the</p>

<p>matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc></p>

<p>You must away to court, sir, presently.</p>

<p>A dozen captains stay at door for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc> <i>[to Page]</i>  Pay the musicians, sirrah.–</p>

<p>Farewell, hostess.–Farewell, Doll. You see, my</p>

<p>good wenches, how men of merit are sought after.</p>

<p>The undeserver may sleep when the man of action</p>

<p>is called on. Farewell, good wenches. If I be not sent</p>

<p>away post, I will see you again ere I go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doll</sc>  I cannot speak. If my heart be not ready to</p>

<p>burst–well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Falstaff</sc>  Farewell, farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with Bardolph, Page, and Musicians.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Well, fare thee well. I have known thee these</p>

<p>twenty-nine years, come peasecod time, but an</p>

<p>honester and truer-hearted man–well, fare thee</p>

<p>well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Mistress Tearsheet!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Bid Mistress Tearsheet come to my</p>

<p>master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  O, run, Doll, run, run, good Doll. Come.–</p>

<p>She comes blubbered.–Yea! Will you come, Doll?</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
