<p>   First my fear, then my curtsy, last my speech. My</p>

<p>fear is your displeasure, my curtsy my duty, and my</p>

<p>speech, to beg your pardons. If you look for a good</p>

<p>speech now, you undo me, for what I have to say is</p>

<p>of mine own making, and what indeed I should say</p>

<p>will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.</p>

<p>   But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it</p>

<p>known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in</p>

<p>the end of a displeasing play to pray your patience</p>

<p>for it and to promise you a better. I meant indeed to</p>

<p>pay you with this, which, if like an ill venture it</p>

<p>come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle</p>

<p>creditors, lose. Here I promised you I would be,</p>

<p>and here I commit my body to your mercies. Bate</p>

<p>me some, and I will pay you some, and, as most</p>

<p>debtors do, promise you infinitely. And so I kneel</p>

<p>down before you, but, indeed, to pray for the</p>

<p>Queen.</p>

<p>   If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me,</p>

<p>will you command me to use my legs? And yet that</p>

<p>were but light payment, to dance out of your debt.</p>

<p>But a good conscience will make any possible</p>

<p>satisfaction, and so would I. All the gentlewomen</p>

<p>here have forgiven me; if the gentlemen will not,</p>

<p>then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen,</p>

<p>which was never seen before in such an</p>

<p>assembly.</p>

<p>   One word more, I beseech you: if you be not too</p>

<p>much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will</p>

<p>continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make</p>

<p>you merry with fair Katherine of France, where, for</p>

<p>anything I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless</p>

<p>already he be killed with your hard opinions; for</p>

<p>Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man.</p>

<p>My tongue is weary; when my legs are too, I will bid</p>

<p>you good night.
