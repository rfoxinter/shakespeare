<p><center><i>[Noise and tumult within. Enter Porter and his Man,</p>

<p>carrying cudgels.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  You’ll leave your noise anon, you rascals! Do</p>

<p>you take the court for Parish Garden? You rude</p>

<p>slaves, leave your gaping!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>One</span> <i>[within]</i>  Good Master Porter, I belong to th’</p>

<p>larder.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  Belong to th’ gallows and be hanged, you rogue!</p>

<p>Is this a place to roar in?–Fetch me a dozen crab-tree</p>

<p>staves, and strong ones. These are but switches</p>

<p>to ’em.–I’ll scratch your heads! You must be seeing</p>

<p>christenings? Do you look for ale and cakes here,</p>

<p>you rude rascals?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span></p>

<p>Pray, sir, be patient. ’Tis as much impossible–</p>

<p>Unless we sweep ’em from the door with cannons–</p>

<p>To scatter ’em as ’tis to make ’em sleep</p>

<p>On May Day morning, which will never be.</p>

<p>We may as well push against Paul’s as stir ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  How got they in, and be hanged?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span></p>

<p>Alas, I know not. How gets the tide in?</p>

<p>As much as one sound cudgel of four foot–</p>

<p>You see the poor remainder–could distribute,</p>

<p>I made no spare, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  You did nothing, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span></p>

<p>I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,</p>

<p>To mow ’em down before me; but if I spared any</p>

<p>That had a head to hit, either young or old,</p>

<p>He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,</p>

<p>Let me ne’er hope to see a chine again–</p>

<p>And that I would not for a cow, God save her!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>One</span> <i>[within]</i>  Do you hear, Master Porter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  I shall be with you presently, good master</p>

<p>puppy.– Keep the door close, sirrah.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  What would you have me do?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  What should you do but knock ’em down by</p>

<p>th’ dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? Or have</p>

<p>we some strange Indian with the great tool come to</p>

<p>court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a</p>

<p>fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian conscience,</p>

<p>this one christening will beget a thousand;</p>

<p>here will be father, godfather, and all together.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is</p>

<p>a fellow somewhat near the door–he should be a</p>

<p>brazier by his face, for, o’ my conscience, twenty of</p>

<p>the dog days now reign in ’s nose. All that stand</p>

<p>about him are under the line; they need no other</p>

<p>penance. That fire-drake did I hit three times on the</p>

<p>head, and three times was his nose discharged</p>

<p>against me. He stands there like a mortar-piece, to</p>

<p>blow us. There was a haberdasher’s wife of small</p>

<p>wit near him that railed upon me till her pinked</p>

<p>porringer fell off her head for kindling such a</p>

<p>combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once</p>

<p>and hit that woman, who cried out “Clubs!” when I</p>

<p>might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to</p>

<p>her succor, which were the hope o’ th’ Strand, where</p>

<p>she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my</p>

<p>place. At length they came to th’ broomstaff to me;</p>

<p>I defied ’em still, when suddenly a file of boys behind</p>

<p>’em, loose shot, delivered such a shower of</p>

<p>pibbles that I was fain to draw mine honor in and</p>

<p>let ’em win the work. The devil was amongst ’em, I</p>

<p>think, surely.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse</p>

<p>and fight for bitten apples, that no audience</p>

<p>but the tribulation of Tower Hill or the limbs of</p>

<p>Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to</p>

<p>endure. I have some of ’em in Limbo Patrum, and</p>

<p>there they are like to dance these three days, besides</p>

<p>the running banquet of two beadles that is to come.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Chamberlain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span></p>

<p>Mercy o’ me, what a multitude are here!</p>

<p>They grow still too. From all parts they are coming,</p>

<p>As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,</p>

<p>These lazy knaves?–You’ve made a fine hand, fellows!</p>

<p>There’s a trim rabble let in. Are all these</p>

<p>Your faithful friends o’ th’ suburbs? We shall have</p>

<p>Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,</p>

<p>When they pass back from the christening!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  An ’t please</p>

<p>your Honor,</p>

<p>We are but men, and what so many may do,</p>

<p>Not being torn a-pieces, we have done.</p>

<p>An army cannot rule ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  As I live,</p>

<p>If the King blame me for ’t, I’ll lay you all</p>

<p>By th’ heels, and suddenly, and on your heads</p>

<p>Clap round fines for neglect. You’re lazy knaves,</p>

<p>And here you lie baiting of bombards, when</p>

<p>You should do service.     <i><i>[Trumpets.]</i></i></p>

<p>Hark, the trumpets sound!</p>

<p>They’re come already from the christening.</p>

<p>Go break among the press, and find a way out</p>

<p>To let the troop pass fairly, or I’ll find</p>

<p>A Marshalsea shall hold you play these two months.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span></p>

<p>Make way there for the Princess!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  You great fellow,</p>

<p>Stand close up, or I’ll make your head ache.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span></p>

<p>You i’ th’ camlet, get up o’ th’ rail!</p>

<p>I’ll peck you o’er the pales else.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
