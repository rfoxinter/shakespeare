<p><center><i>[Enter Trumpets, sounding. Then two Aldermen, Lord</p>

<p>Mayor, Garter, Cranmer, Duke of Norfolk with his</p>

<p>Noblemen bearing a canopy, under which the Duchess</p>

<p>of Norfolk, godmother, bearing the child richly habited</p>

<p>in a mantle, etc., train borne by a Lady. Then follows the</p>

<p>Marchioness Dorset, the other godmother, and Ladies.</p>

<p>The troop pass once about the stage, and Garter speaks.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Garter</sc>  Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send</p>

<p>prosperous life, long, and ever happy, to the high</p>

<p>and mighty princess of England, Elizabeth.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King and Guard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cranmer</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>And to your royal Grace and the good queen,</p>

<p>My noble partners and myself thus pray</p>

<p>All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady</p>

<p>Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy</p>

<p>May hourly fall upon you!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Thank you, good lord</p>

<p>Archbishop.</p>

<p>What is her name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cranmer</sc>  Elizabeth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Stand up, lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cranmer stands.]</i></center></p>

<p>With this kiss take my blessing.     <i><i>[King kisses infant.]</i></i></p>

<p>God protect thee,</p>

<p>Into whose hand I give thy life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cranmer</sc>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[to the two godmothers]</i></p>

<p>My noble gossips, you’ve been too prodigal.</p>

<p>I thank you heartily; so shall this lady</p>

<p>When she has so much English.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cranmer</sc>  Let me speak, sir,</p>

<p>For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter</p>

<p>Let none think flattery, for they’ll find ’em truth.</p>

<p>This royal infant–heaven still move about her!–</p>

<p>Though in her cradle, yet now promises</p>

<p>Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,</p>

<p>Which time shall bring to ripeness. She shall be–</p>

<p>But few now living can behold that goodness–</p>

<p>A pattern to all princes living with her</p>

<p>And all that shall succeed. Saba was never</p>

<p>More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue</p>

<p>Than this pure soul shall be. All princely graces</p>

<p>That mold up such a mighty piece as this is,</p>

<p>With all the virtues that attend the good,</p>

<p>Shall still be doubled on her. Truth shall nurse her;</p>

<p>Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her.</p>

<p>She shall be loved and feared. Her own shall bless her;</p>

<p>Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn</p>

<p>And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with</p>

<p>her.</p>

<p>In her days every man shall eat in safety</p>

<p>Under his own vine what he plants and sing</p>

<p>The merry songs of peace to all his neighbors.</p>

<p>God shall be truly known, and those about her</p>

<p>From her shall read the perfect ways of honor</p>

<p>And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.</p>

<p>Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but, as when</p>

<p>The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,</p>

<p>Her ashes new create another heir</p>

<p>As great in admiration as herself,</p>

<p>So shall she leave her blessedness to one,</p>

<p>When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,</p>

<p>Who from the sacred ashes of her honor</p>

<p>Shall starlike rise as great in fame as she was</p>

<p>And so stand fixed. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,</p>

<p>That were the servants to this chosen infant,</p>

<p>Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him.</p>

<p>Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,</p>

<p>His honor and the greatness of his name</p>

<p>Shall be, and make new nations. He shall flourish,</p>

<p>And like a mountain cedar reach his branches</p>

<p>To all the plains about him. Our children’s children</p>

<p>Shall see this and bless heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Thou speakest wonders.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cranmer</sc></p>

<p>She shall be to the happiness of England</p>

<p>An aged princess; many days shall see her,</p>

<p>And yet no day without a deed to crown it.</p>

<p>Would I had known no more! But she must die,</p>

<p>She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,</p>

<p>A most unspotted lily, shall she pass</p>

<p>To th’ ground, and all the world shall mourn her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  O lord</p>

<p>Archbishop,</p>

<p>Thou hast made me now a man. Never before</p>

<p>This happy child did I get anything.</p>

<p>This oracle of comfort has so pleased me</p>

<p>That when I am in heaven I shall desire</p>

<p>To see what this child does and praise my Maker.–</p>

<p>I thank you all.–To you, my good lord mayor</p>

<p>And you, good brethren, I am much beholding.</p>

<p>I have received much honor by your presence,</p>

<p>And you shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords.</p>

<p>You must all see the Queen, and she must thank you;</p>

<p>She will be sick else. This day, no man think</p>

<p>’Has business at his house, for all shall stay.</p>

<p>This little one shall make it holiday.</p>
