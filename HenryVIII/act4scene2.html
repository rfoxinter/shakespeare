<p><center><i>[Enter Katherine Dowager, sick, led between Griffith, her</p>

<p>gentleman usher, and Patience, her woman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Griffith</span></p>

<p>How does your Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  O Griffith, sick to death.</p>

<p>My legs like loaden branches bow to th’ earth,</p>

<p>Willing to leave their burden. Reach a chair.</p>

<p><center><i>[She sits.]</i></center></p>

<p>So. Now, methinks, I feel a little ease.</p>

<p>Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou ledst me,</p>

<p>That the great child of honor, Cardinal Wolsey,</p>

<p>Was dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Griffith</span>  Yes, madam, but I think your Grace,</p>

<p>Out of the pain you suffered, gave no ear to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.</p>

<p>If well, he stepped before me happily</p>

<p>For my example.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Griffith</span>  Well, the voice goes, madam;</p>

<p>For after the stout Earl Northumberland</p>

<p>Arrested him at York and brought him forward,</p>

<p>As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,</p>

<p>He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill</p>

<p>He could not sit his mule.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  Alas, poor man!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Griffith</span></p>

<p>At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,</p>

<p>Lodged in the abbey, where the reverend abbot</p>

<p>With all his convent honorably received him;</p>

<p>To whom he gave these words: “O Father Abbot,</p>

<p>An old man, broken with the storms of state,</p>

<p>Is come to lay his weary bones among you.</p>

<p>Give him a little earth, for charity.”</p>

<p>So went to bed, where eagerly his sickness</p>

<p>Pursued him still; and three nights after this,</p>

<p>About the hour of eight, which he himself</p>

<p>Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,</p>

<p>Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,</p>

<p>He gave his honors to the world again,</p>

<p>His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>So may he rest. His faults lie gently on him!</p>

<p>Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,</p>

<p>And yet with charity. He was a man</p>

<p>Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking</p>

<p>Himself with princes; one that by suggestion</p>

<p>Tied all the kingdom. Simony was fair play.</p>

<p>His own opinion was his law. I’ th’ presence</p>

<p>He would say untruths, and be ever double</p>

<p>Both in his words and meaning. He was never,</p>

<p>But where he meant to ruin, pitiful.</p>

<p>His promises were, as he then was, mighty,</p>

<p>But his performance, as he is now, nothing.</p>

<p>Of his own body he was ill, and gave</p>

<p>The clergy ill example.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Griffith</span>  Noble madam,</p>

<p>Men’s evil manners live in brass; their virtues</p>

<p>We write in water. May it please your Highness</p>

<p>To hear me speak his good now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  Yes, good Griffith;</p>

<p>I were malicious else.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Griffith</span>  This cardinal,</p>

<p>Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly</p>

<p>Was fashioned to much honor. From his cradle</p>

<p>He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one:</p>

<p>Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;</p>

<p>Lofty and sour to them that loved him not,</p>

<p>But, to those men that sought him, sweet as summer.</p>

<p>And though he were unsatisfied in getting,</p>

<p>Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,</p>

<p>He was most princely. Ever witness for him</p>

<p>Those twins of learning that he raised in you,</p>

<p>Ipswich and Oxford, one of which fell with him,</p>

<p>Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;</p>

<p>The other, though unfinished, yet so famous,</p>

<p>So excellent in art, and still so rising,</p>

<p>That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.</p>

<p>His overthrow heaped happiness upon him,</p>

<p>For then, and not till then, he felt himself,</p>

<p>And found the blessedness of being little.</p>

<p>And, to add greater honors to his age</p>

<p>Than man could give him, he died fearing God.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>After my death I wish no other herald,</p>

<p>No other speaker of my living actions,</p>

<p>To keep mine honor from corruption</p>

<p>But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.</p>

<p>Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,</p>

<p>With thy religious truth and modesty,</p>

<p>Now in his ashes honor. Peace be with him!–</p>

<p>Patience, be near me still, and set me lower.</p>

<p>I have not long to trouble thee.–Good Griffith,</p>

<p>Cause the musicians play me that sad note</p>

<p>I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating</p>

<p>On that celestial harmony I go to.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sad and solemn music.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Griffith</span></p>

<p>She is asleep. Good wench, let’s sit down quiet,</p>

<p>For fear we wake her. Softly, gentle Patience.</p>

<p><center><i>[They sit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The Vision.</p>

<br/>

<p>Enter, solemnly tripping one after another, six</p>

<p>Personages clad in white robes, wearing on their</p>

<p>heads garlands of bays, and golden vizards on their</p>

<p>faces, branches of bays or palm in their hands. They</p>

<p>first congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain</p>

<p>changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her</p>

<p>head, at which the other four make reverent curtsies.</p>

<p>Then the two that held the garland deliver the same</p>

<p>to the other next two, who observe the same order in</p>

<p>their changes and holding the garland over her head;</p>

<p>which done, they deliver the same garland to the last</p>

<p>two, who likewise observe the same order. At which,</p>

<p>as it were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep</p>

<p>signs of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to</p>

<p>heaven; and so, in their dancing, vanish, carrying</p>

<p>the garland with them.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The music continues.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span> <i>[waking]</i></p>

<p>Spirits of peace, where are you? Are you all gone,</p>

<p>And leave me here in wretchedness behind you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Griffith</span></p>

<p>Madam, we are here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  It is not you I call for.</p>

<p>Saw you none enter since I slept?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Griffith</span>  None, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop</p>

<p>Invite me to a banquet, whose bright faces</p>

<p>Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?</p>

<p>They promised me eternal happiness</p>

<p>And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel</p>

<p>I am not worthy yet to wear. I shall, assuredly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Griffith</span></p>

<p>I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams</p>

<p>Possess your fancy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  Bid the music leave.</p>

<p>They are harsh and heavy to me.     <i><i>[Music ceases.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patience</span> <i>[aside to Griffith]</i>  Do you note</p>

<p>How much her Grace is altered on the sudden?</p>

<p>How long her face is drawn? How pale she looks,</p>

<p>And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Griffith</span> <i>[aside to Patience]</i></p>

<p>She is going, wench. Pray, pray.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patience</span>  Heaven comfort her!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span> <i>[to Katherine]</i></p>

<p>An ’t like your Grace–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  You are a saucy fellow.</p>

<p>Deserve we no more reverence?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Griffith</span> <i>[to Messenger]</i>  You are to blame,</p>

<p>Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,</p>

<p>To use so rude behavior. Go to. Kneel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>I humbly do entreat your Highness’ pardon.</p>

<p>My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying</p>

<p>A gentleman sent from the King to see you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Admit him entrance, Griffith.     <i><i>[Messenger rises.]</i></i></p>

<p>But this fellow</p>

<p>Let me ne’er see again.     <i><i>[Messenger exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Capuchius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>If my sight fail not,</p>

<p>You should be Lord Ambassador from the Emperor,</p>

<p>My royal nephew, and your name Capuchius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capuchius</span></p>

<p>Madam, the same. Your servant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  O my lord,</p>

<p>The times and titles now are altered strangely</p>

<p>With me since first you knew me. But I pray you,</p>

<p>What is your pleasure with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capuchius</span>  Noble lady,</p>

<p>First, mine own service to your Grace; the next,</p>

<p>The King’s request that I would visit you,</p>

<p>Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me</p>

<p>Sends you his princely commendations,</p>

<p>And heartily entreats you take good comfort.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>O, my good lord, that comfort comes too late;</p>

<p>’Tis like a pardon after execution.</p>

<p>That gentle physic given in time had cured me.</p>

<p>But now I am past all comforts here but prayers.</p>

<p>How does his Highness?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capuchius</span>  Madam, in good health.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>So may he ever do, and ever flourish,</p>

<p>When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name</p>

<p>Banished the kingdom.–Patience, is that letter</p>

<p>I caused you write yet sent away?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patience</span>  No, madam.</p>

<p><center><i>[She presents a paper to Katherine, who gives</p>

<p>it to Capuchius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver</p>

<p>This to my lord the King–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capuchius</span>  Most willing, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>In which I have commended to his goodness</p>

<p>The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter–</p>

<p>The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!–</p>

<p>Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding–</p>

<p>She is young and of a noble, modest nature;</p>

<p>I hope she will deserve well–and a little</p>

<p>To love her for her mother’s sake that loved him,</p>

<p>Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition</p>

<p>Is that his noble Grace would have some pity</p>

<p>Upon my wretched women, that so long</p>

<p>Have followed both my fortunes faithfully,</p>

<p>Of which there is not one, I dare avow–</p>

<p>And now I should not lie–but will deserve,</p>

<p>For virtue and true beauty of the soul,</p>

<p>For honesty and decent carriage,</p>

<p>A right good husband. Let him be a noble;</p>

<p>And sure those men are happy that shall have ’em.</p>

<p>The last is for my men–they are the poorest,</p>

<p>But poverty could never draw ’em from me–</p>

<p>That they may have their wages duly paid ’em,</p>

<p>And something over to remember me by.</p>

<p>If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life</p>

<p>And able means, we had not parted thus.</p>

<p>These are the whole contents. And, good my lord,</p>

<p>By that you love the dearest in this world,</p>

<p>As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,</p>

<p>Stand these poor people’s friend, and urge the King</p>

<p>To do me this last right.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capuchius</span>  By heaven, I will,</p>

<p>Or let me lose the fashion of a man!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>I thank you, honest lord. Remember me</p>

<p>In all humility unto his Highness.</p>

<p>Say his long trouble now is passing</p>

<p>Out of this world. Tell him in death I blessed him,</p>

<p>For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,</p>

<p>My lord.–Griffith, farewell.–Nay, Patience,</p>

<p>You must not leave me yet. I must to bed;</p>

<p>Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,</p>

<p>Let me be used with honor. Strew me over</p>

<p>With maiden flowers, that all the world may know</p>

<p>I was a chaste wife to my grave. Embalm me,</p>

<p>Then lay me forth. Although unqueened, yet like</p>

<p>A queen and daughter to a king inter me.</p>

<p>I can no more.</p>
