<p><center><i>[Enter two Gentlemen at several doors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Whither away so fast?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  O, God save you.</p>

<p>E’en to the Hall to hear what shall become</p>

<p>Of the great Duke of Buckingham.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  I’ll save you</p>

<p>That labor, sir. All’s now done but the ceremony</p>

<p>Of bringing back the prisoner.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Were you there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Yes, indeed was I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Pray speak what has happened.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>You may guess quickly what.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Is he found guilty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Yes, truly, is he, and condemned upon ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>I am sorry for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  So are a number more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  But pray, how passed it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>I’ll tell you in a little. The great duke</p>

<p>Came to the bar, where to his accusations</p>

<p>He pleaded still not guilty and alleged</p>

<p>Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</p>

<p>The King’s attorney on the contrary</p>

<p>Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions</p>

<p>Of divers witnesses, which the Duke desired</p>

<p>To him brought viva voce to his face;</p>

<p>At which appeared against him his surveyor,</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor, and John Car,</p>

<p>Confessor to him, with that devil monk,</p>

<p>Hopkins, that made this mischief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  That was he</p>

<p>That fed him with his prophecies?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  The same.</p>

<p>All these accused him strongly, which he fain</p>

<p>Would have flung from him, but indeed he could not.</p>

<p>And so his peers upon this evidence</p>

<p>Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</p>

<p>He spoke, and learnedly, for life, but all</p>

<p>Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>After all this, how did he bear himself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>When he was brought again to th’ bar to hear</p>

<p>His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirred</p>

<p>With such an agony he sweat extremely</p>

<p>And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty.</p>

<p>But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</p>

<p>In all the rest showed a most noble patience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>I do not think he fears death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Sure he does not;</p>

<p>He never was so womanish. The cause</p>

<p>He may a little grieve at.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Certainly</p>

<p>The Cardinal is the end of this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  ’Tis likely,</p>

<p>By all conjectures; first, Kildare’s attainder,</p>

<p>Then Deputy of Ireland, who, removed,</p>

<p>Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,</p>

<p>Lest he should help his father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  That trick of state</p>

<p>Was a deep envious one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  At his return</p>

<p>No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,</p>

<p>And generally: whoever the King favors,</p>

<p>The Card’nal instantly will find employment,</p>

<p>And far enough from court too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  All the commons</p>

<p>Hate him perniciously and, o’ my conscience,</p>

<p>Wish him ten fathom deep. This duke as much</p>

<p>They love and dote on, call him bounteous</p>

<p>Buckingham,</p>

<p>The mirror of all courtesy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Stay there, sir,</p>

<p>And see the noble ruined man you speak of.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Buckingham from his arraignment, Tipstaves before</p>

<p>him, the ax with the edge towards him, Halberds on each</p>

<p>side, accompanied with Sir Thomas Lovell, Sir Nicholas</p>

<p>Vaux, Sir Walter Sands, and Common People, etc.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Let’s stand close and behold him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  All good people,</p>

<p>You that thus far have come to pity me,</p>

<p>Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.</p>

<p>I have this day received a traitor’s judgment,</p>

<p>And by that name must die. Yet heaven bear witness,</p>

<p>And if I have a conscience, let it sink me</p>

<p>Even as the ax falls, if I be not faithful!</p>

<p>The law I bear no malice for my death;</p>

<p>’T has done, upon the premises, but justice.</p>

<p>But those that sought it I could wish more Christian.</p>

<p>Be what they will, I heartily forgive ’em.</p>

<p>Yet let ’em look they glory not in mischief,</p>

<p>Nor build their evils on the graves of great men,</p>

<p>For then my guiltless blood must cry against ’em.</p>

<p>For further life in this world I ne’er hope,</p>

<p>Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies</p>

<p>More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me</p>

<p>And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,</p>

<p>His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave</p>

<p>Is only bitter to him, only dying,</p>

<p>Go with me like good angels to my end,</p>

<p>And as the long divorce of steel falls on me,</p>

<p>Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,</p>

<p>And lift my soul to heaven.–Lead on, a’ God’s name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lovell</sc></p>

<p>I do beseech your Grace, for charity,</p>

<p>If ever any malice in your heart</p>

<p>Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you</p>

<p>As I would be forgiven. I forgive all.</p>

<p>There cannot be those numberless offenses</p>

<p>’Gainst me that I cannot take peace with. No black</p>

<p>envy</p>

<p>Shall make my grave. Commend me to his Grace.</p>

<p>And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him</p>

<p>You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers</p>

<p>Yet are the King’s and, till my soul forsake,</p>

<p>Shall cry for blessings on him. May he live</p>

<p>Longer than I have time to tell his years.</p>

<p>Ever beloved and loving may his rule be;</p>

<p>And when old Time shall lead him to his end,</p>

<p>Goodness and he fill up one monument!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lovell</sc></p>

<p>To th’ waterside I must conduct your Grace,</p>

<p>Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,</p>

<p>Who undertakes you to your end.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Vaux</sc> <i>[calling as to Officers offstage]</i>  Prepare there!</p>

<p>The Duke is coming. See the barge be ready,</p>

<p>And fit it with such furniture as suits</p>

<p>The greatness of his person.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc>  Nay, Sir Nicholas,</p>

<p>Let it alone. My state now will but mock me.</p>

<p>When I came hither, I was Lord High Constable</p>

<p>And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.</p>

<p>Yet I am richer than my base accusers,</p>

<p>That never knew what truth meant. I now seal it,</p>

<p>And with that blood will make ’em one day groan for ’t.</p>

<p>My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,</p>

<p>Who first raised head against usurping Richard,</p>

<p>Flying for succor to his servant Banister,</p>

<p>Being distressed, was by that wretch betrayed,</p>

<p>And, without trial, fell. God’s peace be with him.</p>

<p>Henry the Seventh, succeeding, truly pitying</p>

<p>My father’s loss, like a most royal prince</p>

<p>Restored me to my honors and out of ruins</p>

<p>Made my name once more noble. Now his son,</p>

<p>Henry the Eighth, life, honor, name, and all</p>

<p>That made me happy at one stroke has taken</p>

<p>Forever from the world. I had my trial,</p>

<p>And must needs say a noble one, which makes me</p>

<p>A little happier than my wretched father.</p>

<p>Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both</p>

<p>Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most–</p>

<p>A most unnatural and faithless service.</p>

<p>Heaven has an end in all; yet, you that hear me,</p>

<p>This from a dying man receive as certain:</p>

<p>Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels</p>

<p>Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends</p>

<p>And give your hearts to, when they once perceive</p>

<p>The least rub in your fortunes, fall away</p>

<p>Like water from you, never found again</p>

<p>But where they mean to sink you. All good people,</p>

<p>Pray for me. I must now forsake you. The last hour</p>

<p>Of my long weary life is come upon me.</p>

<p>Farewell. And when you would say something that</p>

<p>is sad,</p>

<p>Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Duke and train exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>O, this is full of pity, sir! It calls,</p>

<p>I fear, too many curses on their heads</p>

<p>That were the authors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  If the Duke be guiltless,</p>

<p>’Tis full of woe. Yet I can give you inkling</p>

<p>Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,</p>

<p>Greater than this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Good angels keep it from us!</p>

<p>What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>This secret is so weighty ’twill require</p>

<p>A strong faith to conceal it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Let me have it.</p>

<p>I do not talk much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  I am confident;</p>

<p>You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear</p>

<p>A buzzing of a separation</p>

<p>Between the King and Katherine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Yes, but it held not;</p>

<p>For when the King once heard it, out of anger</p>

<p>He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight</p>

<p>To stop the rumor and allay those tongues</p>

<p>That durst disperse it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  But that slander, sir,</p>

<p>Is found a truth now, for it grows again</p>

<p>Fresher than e’er it was, and held for certain</p>

<p>The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal,</p>

<p>Or some about him near, have, out of malice</p>

<p>To the good queen, possessed him with a scruple</p>

<p>That will undo her. To confirm this too,</p>

<p>Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately,</p>

<p>As all think, for this business.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  ’Tis the Cardinal;</p>

<p>And merely to revenge him on the Emperor</p>

<p>For not bestowing on him at his asking</p>

<p>The archbishopric of Toledo this is purposed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>I think you have hit the mark. But is ’t not cruel</p>

<p>That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal</p>

<p>Will have his will, and she must fall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  ’Tis woeful.</p>

<p>We are too open here to argue this.</p>

<p>Let’s think in private more.</p>
