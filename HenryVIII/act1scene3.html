<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Chamberlain and Lord Sands.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span></p>

<p>Is ’t possible the spells of France should juggle</p>

<p>Men into such strange mysteries?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sands</span>  New customs,</p>

<p>Though they be never so ridiculous–</p>

<p>Nay, let ’em be unmanly–yet are followed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span></p>

<p>As far as I see, all the good our English</p>

<p>Have got by the late voyage is but merely</p>

<p>A fit or two o’ th’ face; but they are shrewd ones,</p>

<p>For when they hold ’em, you would swear directly</p>

<p>Their very noses had been counselors</p>

<p>To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sands</span></p>

<p>They have all new legs and lame ones; one would</p>

<p>take it,</p>

<p>That never see ’em pace before, the spavin</p>

<p>Or springhalt reigned among ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  Death! My lord,</p>

<p>Their clothes are after such a pagan cut to ’t,</p>

<p>That, sure, they’ve worn out Christendom.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Thomas Lovell.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now?</p>

<p>What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span>  Faith, my lord,</p>

<p>I hear of none but the new proclamation</p>

<p>That’s clapped upon the court gate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  What is ’t for?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span></p>

<p>The reformation of our traveled gallants</p>

<p>That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span></p>

<p>I’m glad ’tis there; now I would pray our monsieurs</p>

<p>To think an English courtier may be wise</p>

<p>And never see the Louvre.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span>  They must either–</p>

<p>For so run the conditions–leave those remnants</p>

<p>Of fool and feather that they got in France,</p>

<p>With all their honorable points of ignorance</p>

<p>Pertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,</p>

<p>Abusing better men than they can be</p>

<p>Out of a foreign wisdom, renouncing clean</p>

<p>The faith they have in tennis and tall stockings,</p>

<p>Short blistered breeches, and those types of travel,</p>

<p>And understand again like honest men,</p>

<p>Or pack to their old playfellows. There, I take it,</p>

<p>They may cum privilegio “oui” away</p>

<p>The lag end of their lewdness and be laughed at.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sands</span></p>

<p>’Tis time to give ’em physic, their diseases</p>

<p>Are grown so catching.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  What a loss our ladies</p>

<p>Will have of these trim vanities!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span>  Ay, marry,</p>

<p>There will be woe indeed, lords. The sly whoresons</p>

<p>Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies.</p>

<p>A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sands</span></p>

<p>The devil fiddle ’em! I am glad they are going,</p>

<p>For sure there’s no converting of ’em. Now</p>

<p>An honest country lord, as I am, beaten</p>

<p>A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong,</p>

<p>And have an hour of hearing, and, by ’r Lady,</p>

<p>Held current music too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  Well said, Lord Sands.</p>

<p>Your colt’s tooth is not cast yet?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sands</span>  No, my lord,</p>

<p>Nor shall not while I have a stump.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  Sir Thomas,</p>

<p>Whither were you a-going?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span>  To the Cardinal’s.</p>

<p>Your Lordship is a guest too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  O, ’tis true.</p>

<p>This night he makes a supper, and a great one,</p>

<p>To many lords and ladies. There will be</p>

<p>The beauty of this kingdom, I’ll assure you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span></p>

<p>That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,</p>

<p>A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us.</p>

<p>His dews fall everywhere.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  No doubt he’s noble;</p>

<p>He had a black mouth that said other of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sands</span></p>

<p>He may, my lord. ’Has wherewithal. In him,</p>

<p>Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine.</p>

<p>Men of his way should be most liberal;</p>

<p>They are set here for examples.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  True, they are so,</p>

<p>But few now give so great ones. My barge stays.</p>

<p>Your Lordship shall along.–Come, good Sir Thomas,</p>

<p>We shall be late else, which I would not be,</p>

<p>For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guilford</p>

<p>This night to be comptrollers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sands</span>  I am your Lordship’s.</p>
