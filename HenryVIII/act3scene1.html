<p><center><i>[Enter Queen and her Women, as at work.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Take thy lute, wench. My soul grows sad with troubles.</p>

<p>Sing, and disperse ’em if thou canst. Leave working.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Woman</sc> <i>[sings song.]</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>Orpheus with his lute made trees</i></p>

<p>     <i>And the mountaintops that freeze</i></p>

<p>        <i>Bow themselves when he did sing.</i></p>

<p>     <i>To his music plants and flowers</i></p>

<p>     <i>Ever sprung, as sun and showers</i></p>

<p>        <i>There had made a lasting spring.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>Everything that heard him play,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Even the billows of the sea,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Hung their heads and then lay by.</i></p>

<p>     <i>In sweet music is such art,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Killing care and grief of heart</i></p>

<p>        <i>Fall asleep or, hearing, die.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  How now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>An ’t please your Grace, the two great cardinals</p>

<p>Wait in the presence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  Would they speak with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>They willed me say so, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  Pray their Graces</p>

<p>To come near.     <i><i>[Gentleman exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>What can be their business</p>

<p>With me, a poor weak woman, fall’n from favor?</p>

<p>I do not like their coming, now I think on ’t.</p>

<p>They should be good men, their affairs as righteous.</p>

<p>But all hoods make not monks.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the two Cardinals, Wolsey and Campeius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Peace to your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Your Graces find me here part of a housewife;</p>

<p>I would be all, against the worst may happen.</p>

<p>What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw</p>

<p>Into your private chamber, we shall give you</p>

<p>The full cause of our coming.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  Speak it here.</p>

<p>There’s nothing I have done yet, o’ my conscience,</p>

<p>Deserves a corner. Would all other women</p>

<p>Could speak this with as free a soul as I do.</p>

<p>My lords, I care not, so much I am happy</p>

<p>Above a number, if my actions</p>

<p>Were tried by ev’ry tongue, ev’ry eye saw ’em,</p>

<p>Envy and base opinion set against ’em,</p>

<p>I know my life so even. If your business</p>

<p>Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,</p>

<p>Out with it boldly. Truth loves open dealing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina</p>

<p>serenissima–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  O, good my lord, no Latin!</p>

<p>I am not such a truant since my coming</p>

<p>As not to know the language I have lived in.</p>

<p>A strange tongue makes my cause more strange,</p>

<p>suspicious.</p>

<p>Pray speak in English. Here are some will thank you,</p>

<p>If you speak truth, for their poor mistress’ sake.</p>

<p>Believe me, she has had much wrong. Lord Cardinal,</p>

<p>The willing’st sin I ever yet committed</p>

<p>May be absolved in English.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Noble lady,</p>

<p>I am sorry my integrity should breed–</p>

<p>And service to his Majesty and you–</p>

<p>So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.</p>

<p>We come not by the way of accusation,</p>

<p>To taint that honor every good tongue blesses,</p>

<p>Nor to betray you any way to sorrow–</p>

<p>You have too much, good lady–but to know</p>

<p>How you stand minded in the weighty difference</p>

<p>Between the King and you, and to deliver,</p>

<p>Like free and honest men, our just opinions</p>

<p>And comforts to your cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Campeius</sc>  Most honored madam,</p>

<p>My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,</p>

<p>Zeal, and obedience he still bore your Grace,</p>

<p>Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure</p>

<p>Both of his truth and him–which was too far–</p>

<p>Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,</p>

<p>His service and his counsel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  To betray me.–</p>

<p>My lords, I thank you both for your good wills.</p>

<p>You speak like honest men; pray God you prove so.</p>

<p>But how to make you suddenly an answer</p>

<p>In such a point of weight, so near mine honor–</p>

<p>More near my life, I fear–with my weak wit,</p>

<p>And to such men of gravity and learning,</p>

<p>In truth I know not. I was set at work</p>

<p>Among my maids, full little, God knows, looking</p>

<p>Either for such men or such business.</p>

<p>For her sake that I have been–for I feel</p>

<p>The last fit of my greatness–good your Graces,</p>

<p>Let me have time and counsel for my cause.</p>

<p>Alas, I am a woman friendless, hopeless.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>Madam, you wrong the King’s love with these fears;</p>

<p>Your hopes and friends are infinite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  In England</p>

<p>But little for my profit. Can you think, lords,</p>

<p>That any Englishman dare give me counsel,</p>

<p>Or be a known friend, ’gainst his Highness’ pleasure,</p>

<p>Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,</p>

<p>And live a subject? Nay, forsooth. My friends,</p>

<p>They that must weigh out my afflictions,</p>

<p>They that my trust must grow to, live not here.</p>

<p>They are, as all my other comforts, far hence</p>

<p>In mine own country, lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Campeius</sc>  I would your Grace</p>

<p>Would leave your griefs and take my counsel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  How, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Campeius</sc></p>

<p>Put your main cause into the King’s protection.</p>

<p>He’s loving and most gracious. ’Twill be much</p>

<p>Both for your honor better and your cause,</p>

<p>For if the trial of the law o’ertake you,</p>

<p>You’ll part away disgraced.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  He tells you rightly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>You tell me what you wish for both: my ruin.</p>

<p>Is this your Christian counsel? Out upon you!</p>

<p>Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge</p>

<p>That no king can corrupt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Campeius</sc>  Your rage mistakes us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>The more shame for you! Holy men I thought you,</p>

<p>Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;</p>

<p>But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear you.</p>

<p>Mend ’em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?</p>

<p>The cordial that you bring a wretched lady,</p>

<p>A woman lost among you, laughed at, scorned?</p>

<p>I will not wish you half my miseries;</p>

<p>I have more charity. But say I warned you:</p>

<p>Take heed, for heaven’s sake, take heed, lest at once</p>

<p>The burden of my sorrows fall upon you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>Madam, this is a mere distraction.</p>

<p>You turn the good we offer into envy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>You turn me into nothing! Woe upon you</p>

<p>And all such false professors. Would you have me–</p>

<p>If you have any justice, any pity,</p>

<p>If you be anything but churchmen’s habits–</p>

<p>Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?</p>

<p>Alas, has banished me his bed already,</p>

<p>His love, too, long ago. I am old, my lords,</p>

<p>And all the fellowship I hold now with him</p>

<p>Is only my obedience. What can happen</p>

<p>To me above this wretchedness? All your studies</p>

<p>Make me a curse like this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Campeius</sc>  Your fears are worse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Have I lived thus long–let me speak myself,</p>

<p>Since virtue finds no friends–a wife, a true one–</p>

<p>A woman, I dare say without vainglory,</p>

<p>Never yet branded with suspicion–</p>

<p>Have I with all my full affections</p>

<p>Still met the King, loved him next heav’n, obeyed him,</p>

<p>Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him,</p>

<p>Almost forgot my prayers to content him,</p>

<p>And am I thus rewarded? ’Tis not well, lords.</p>

<p>Bring me a constant woman to her husband,</p>

<p>One that ne’er dreamed a joy beyond his pleasure,</p>

<p>And to that woman, when she has done most,</p>

<p>Yet will I add an honor: a great patience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty</p>

<p>To give up willingly that noble title</p>

<p>Your master wed me to. Nothing but death</p>

<p>Shall e’er divorce my dignities.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Pray hear me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Would I had never trod this English earth</p>

<p>Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!</p>

<p>You have angels’ faces, but heaven knows your hearts.</p>

<p>What will become of me now, wretched lady?</p>

<p>I am the most unhappy woman living.</p>

<p><i>[To her Women.]</i> Alas, poor wenches, where are now</p>

<p>your fortunes?</p>

<p>Shipwracked upon a kingdom where no pity,</p>

<p>No friends, no hope, no kindred weep for me,</p>

<p>Almost no grave allowed me, like the lily</p>

<p>That once was mistress of the field and flourished,</p>

<p>I’ll hang my head and perish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  If your Grace</p>

<p>Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,</p>

<p>You’d feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady,</p>

<p>Upon what cause, wrong you? Alas, our places,</p>

<p>The way of our profession, is against it.</p>

<p>We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow ’em.</p>

<p>For goodness’ sake, consider what you do,</p>

<p>How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly</p>

<p>Grow from the King’s acquaintance by this carriage.</p>

<p>The hearts of princes kiss obedience,</p>

<p>So much they love it. But to stubborn spirits</p>

<p>They swell and grow as terrible as storms.</p>

<p>I know you have a gentle, noble temper,</p>

<p>A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us</p>

<p>Those we profess: peacemakers, friends, and servants.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Campeius</sc></p>

<p>Madam, you’ll find it so. You wrong your virtues</p>

<p>With these weak women’s fears. A noble spirit,</p>

<p>As yours was put into you, ever casts</p>

<p>Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The King loves</p>

<p>you;</p>

<p>Beware you lose it not. For us, if you please</p>

<p>To trust us in your business, we are ready</p>

<p>To use our utmost studies in your service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Do what you will, my lords, and pray forgive me</p>

<p>If I have used myself unmannerly.</p>

<p>You know I am a woman, lacking wit</p>

<p>To make a seemly answer to such persons.</p>

<p>Pray do my service to his Majesty.</p>

<p>He has my heart yet and shall have my prayers</p>

<p>While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,</p>

<p>Bestow your counsels on me. She now begs</p>

<p>That little thought, when she set footing here,</p>

<p>She should have bought her dignities so dear.</p>
