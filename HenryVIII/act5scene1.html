<p><center><i>[Enter Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, a Page with a</p>

<p>torch before him, met by Sir Thomas Lovell.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span></p>

<p>It’s one o’clock, boy, is ’t not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  It hath struck.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span></p>

<p>These should be hours for necessities,</p>

<p>Not for delights; times to repair our nature</p>

<p>With comforting repose, and not for us</p>

<p>To waste these times.–Good hour of night, Sir</p>

<p>Thomas.</p>

<p>Whither so late?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span>  Came you from the King, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span></p>

<p>I did, Sir Thomas, and left him at primero</p>

<p>With the Duke of Suffolk.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span>  I must to him too,</p>

<p>Before he go to bed. I’ll take my leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span></p>

<p>Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What’s the matter?</p>

<p>It seems you are in haste. An if there be</p>

<p>No great offense belongs to ’t, give your friend</p>

<p>Some touch of your late business. Affairs that walk,</p>

<p>As they say spirits do, at midnight have</p>

<p>In them a wilder nature than the business</p>

<p>That seeks dispatch by day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span>  My lord, I love you,</p>

<p>And durst commend a secret to your ear</p>

<p>Much weightier than this work. The Queen’s in</p>

<p>labor–</p>

<p>They say in great extremity–and feared</p>

<p>She’ll with the labor end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span>  The fruit she goes with</p>

<p>I pray for heartily, that it may find</p>

<p>Good time and live; but for the stock, Sir Thomas,</p>

<p>I wish it grubbed up now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span>  Methinks I could</p>

<p>Cry the amen, and yet my conscience says</p>

<p>She’s a good creature and, sweet lady, does</p>

<p>Deserve our better wishes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span>  But, sir, sir,</p>

<p>Hear me, Sir Thomas. You’re a gentleman</p>

<p>Of mine own way. I know you wise, religious;</p>

<p>And let me tell you, it will ne’er be well,</p>

<p>’Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take ’t of me,</p>

<p>Till Cranmer, Cromwell–her two hands–and she</p>

<p>Sleep in their graves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span>  Now, sir, you speak of two</p>

<p>The most remarked i’ th’ kingdom. As for Cromwell,</p>

<p>Besides that of the Jewel House, is made Master</p>

<p>O’ th’ Rolls and the King’s secretary; further, sir,</p>

<p>Stands in the gap and trade of more preferments,</p>

<p>With which the time will load him. Th’ Archbishop</p>

<p>Is the King’s hand and tongue, and who dare speak</p>

<p>One syllable against him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span>  Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,</p>

<p>There are that dare, and I myself have ventured</p>

<p>To speak my mind of him. And indeed this day,</p>

<p>Sir–I may tell it you, I think–I have</p>

<p>Incensed the lords o’ th’ Council that he is–</p>

<p>For so I know he is, they know he is–</p>

<p>A most arch heretic, a pestilence</p>

<p>That does infect the land; with which they, moved,</p>

<p>Have broken with the King, who hath so far</p>

<p>Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace</p>

<p>And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs</p>

<p>Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning to the Council board</p>

<p>He be convented. He’s a rank weed, Sir Thomas,</p>

<p>And we must root him out. From your affairs</p>

<p>I hinder you too long. Goodnight, Sir Thomas.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span></p>

<p>Many good nights, my lord. I rest your servant.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gardiner and Page exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King and Suffolk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Charles, I will play no more tonight.</p>

<p>My mind’s not on ’t; you are too hard for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Sir, I did never win of you before.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  But little, Charles,</p>

<p>Nor shall not when my fancy’s on my play.–</p>

<p>Now, Lovell, from the Queen what is the news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span></p>

<p>I could not personally deliver to her</p>

<p>What you commanded me, but by her woman</p>

<p>I sent your message, who returned her thanks</p>

<p>In the great’st humbleness, and desired your Highness</p>

<p>Most heartily to pray for her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  What sayst thou, ha?</p>

<p>To pray for her? What, is she crying out?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span></p>

<p>So said her woman, and that her suff’rance made</p>

<p>Almost each pang a death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Alas, good lady!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>God safely quit her of her burden, and</p>

<p>With gentle travail, to the gladding of</p>

<p>Your Highness with an heir!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  ’Tis midnight, Charles.</p>

<p>Prithee, to bed, and in thy prayers remember</p>

<p>Th’ estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone,</p>

<p>For I must think of that which company</p>

<p>Would not be friendly to.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  I wish your Highness</p>

<p>A quiet night, and my good mistress will</p>

<p>Remember in my prayers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Charles, good night.</p>

<p><center><i>[Suffolk exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Anthony Denny.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Well, sir, what follows?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Denny</span></p>

<p>Sir, I have brought my lord the Archbishop,</p>

<p>As you commanded me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Ha! Canterbury?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Denny</span></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  ’Tis true. Where is he, Denny?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Denny</span></p>

<p>He attends your Highness’ pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Bring him to us.</p>

<p><center><i>[Denny exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>This is about that which the Bishop spake.</p>

<p>I am happily come hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cranmer and Denny.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Avoid the gallery.     <i><i>[Lovell seems to stay.]</i></i></p>

<p>Ha! I have said. Be gone!</p>

<p>What!     <i><i>[Lovell and Denny exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span> <i>[aside]</i>  I am fearful. Wherefore frowns he thus?</p>

<p>’Tis his aspect of terror. All’s not well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>How now, my lord? You do desire to know</p>

<p>Wherefore I sent for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span> <i>[kneeling]</i>  It is my duty</p>

<p>T’ attend your Highness’ pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Pray you arise,</p>

<p>My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.</p>

<p>Come, you and I must walk a turn together.</p>

<p>I have news to tell you. Come, come, give me your</p>

<p>hand.     <i><i>[Cranmer rises.]</i></i></p>

<p>Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,</p>

<p>And am right sorry to repeat what follows.</p>

<p>I have, and most unwillingly, of late</p>

<p>Heard many grievous–I do say, my lord,</p>

<p>Grievous–complaints of you, which, being</p>

<p>considered,</p>

<p>Have moved us and our Council that you shall</p>

<p>This morning come before us, where I know</p>

<p>You cannot with such freedom purge yourself</p>

<p>But that, till further trial in those charges</p>

<p>Which will require your answer, you must take</p>

<p>Your patience to you and be well contented</p>

<p>To make your house our Tower. You a brother of us,</p>

<p>It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness</p>

<p>Would come against you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span> <i>[kneeling]</i>  I humbly thank your</p>

<p>Highness,</p>

<p>And am right glad to catch this good occasion</p>

<p>Most throughly to be winnowed, where my chaff</p>

<p>And corn shall fly asunder. For I know</p>

<p>There’s none stands under more calumnious tongues</p>

<p>Than I myself, poor man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Stand up, good Canterbury!</p>

<p>Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted</p>

<p>In us, thy friend. Give me thy hand. Stand up.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cranmer rises.]</i></center></p>

<p>Prithee, let’s walk. Now by my halidom,</p>

<p>What manner of man are you? My lord, I looked</p>

<p>You would have given me your petition that</p>

<p>I should have ta’en some pains to bring together</p>

<p>Yourself and your accusers and to have heard you</p>

<p>Without endurance further.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span>  Most dread liege,</p>

<p>The good I stand on is my truth and honesty.</p>

<p>If they shall fail, I with mine enemies</p>

<p>Will triumph o’er my person, which I weigh not,</p>

<p>Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing</p>

<p>What can be said against me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Know you not</p>

<p>How your state stands i’ th’ world, with the whole</p>

<p>world?</p>

<p>Your enemies are many and not small; their practices</p>

<p>Must bear the same proportion, and not ever</p>

<p>The justice and the truth o’ th’ question carries</p>

<p>The due o’ th’ verdict with it. At what ease</p>

<p>Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt</p>

<p>To swear against you? Such things have been done.</p>

<p>You are potently opposed, and with a malice</p>

<p>Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,</p>

<p>I mean in perjured witness, than your master,</p>

<p>Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived</p>

<p>Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to.</p>

<p>You take a precipice for no leap of danger</p>

<p>And woo your own destruction.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span>  God and your Majesty</p>

<p>Protect mine innocence, or I fall into</p>

<p>The trap is laid for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Be of good cheer.</p>

<p>They shall no more prevail than we give way to.</p>

<p>Keep comfort to you, and this morning see</p>

<p>You do appear before them. If they shall chance,</p>

<p>In charging you with matters, to commit you,</p>

<p>The best persuasions to the contrary</p>

<p>Fail not to use, and with what vehemency</p>

<p>Th’ occasion shall instruct you. If entreaties</p>

<p>Will render you no remedy, this ring</p>

<p>Deliver them, and your appeal to us</p>

<p>There make before them.     <i><i>[He gives Cranmer a ring.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> Look, the good man weeps!</p>

<p>He’s honest, on mine honor! God’s blest mother,</p>

<p>I swear he is truehearted, and a soul</p>

<p>None better in my kingdom.–Get you gone,</p>

<p>And do as I have bid you.     <i><i>[Cranmer exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>He has strangled</p>

<p>His language in his tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span> <i>[(within)]</i>  Come back! What mean you?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Old Lady, followed by Lovell.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span></p>

<p>I’ll not come back! The tidings that I bring</p>

<p>Will make my boldness manners.–Now, good angels</p>

<p>Fly o’er thy royal head and shade thy person</p>

<p>Under their blessed wings!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Now by thy looks</p>

<p>I guess thy message. Is the Queen delivered?</p>

<p>Say “Ay, and of a boy.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span>  Ay, ay, my liege,</p>

<p>And of a lovely boy. The God of heaven</p>

<p>Both now and ever bless her! ’Tis a girl</p>

<p>Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen</p>

<p>Desires your visitation, and to be</p>

<p>Acquainted with this stranger. ’Tis as like you</p>

<p>As cherry is to cherry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Lovell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lovell</span>  Sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Give her an hundred marks. I’ll to the Queen.</p>

<p><center><i>[King exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span></p>

<p>An hundred marks? By this light, I’ll ha’ more.</p>

<p>An ordinary groom is for such payment.</p>

<p>I will have more or scold it out of him.</p>

<p>Said I for this the girl was like to him?</p>

<p>I’ll have more or else unsay ’t. And now,</p>

<p>While ’tis hot, I’ll put it to the issue.</p>
