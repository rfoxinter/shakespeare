<p><center><i>[Cornets. Enter King Henry, leaning on the Cardinal’s</p>

<p>shoulder, with the Nobles, Sir Thomas Lovell, and</p>

<p>Attendants, including a Secretary of the Cardinal.</p>

<p>The Cardinal places himself under the King’s feet on</p>

<p>his right side.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[to Wolsey]</i></p>

<p>My life itself, and the best heart of it,</p>

<p>Thanks you for this great care. I stood i’ th’ level</p>

<p>Of a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks</p>

<p>To you that choked it.–Let be called before us</p>

<p>That gentleman of Buckingham’s; in person</p>

<p>I’ll hear him his confessions justify,</p>

<p>And point by point the treasons of his master</p>

<p>He shall again relate.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[A noise within crying “Room for the Queen!” Enter the</p>

<p>Queen Katherine, ushered by the Duke of Norfolk, and</p>

<p>the Duke of Suffolk. She kneels. The King riseth from</p>

<p>his state.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Nay, we must longer kneel; I am a suitor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Arise, and take place by us.</p>

<p><center><i>[He takes her up, kisses and placeth her by him.]</i></center></p>

<p>Half your suit</p>

<p>Never name to us; you have half our power.</p>

<p>The other moiety ere you ask is given;</p>

<p>Repeat your will, and take it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  Thank your Majesty.</p>

<p>That you would love yourself, and in that love</p>

<p>Not unconsidered leave your honor nor</p>

<p>The dignity of your office, is the point</p>

<p>Of my petition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Lady mine, proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>I am solicited, not by a few,</p>

<p>And those of true condition, that your subjects</p>

<p>Are in great grievance. There have been commissions</p>

<p>Sent down among ’em which hath flawed the heart</p>

<p>Of all their loyalties, wherein, although</p>

<p>My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches</p>

<p>Most bitterly on you as putter-on</p>

<p>Of these exactions, yet the King our master,</p>

<p>Whose honor heaven shield from soil, even he</p>

<p>escapes not</p>

<p>Language unmannerly–yea, such which breaks</p>

<p>The sides of loyalty and almost appears</p>

<p>In loud rebellion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  Not “almost appears”–</p>

<p>It doth appear. For, upon these taxations,</p>

<p>The clothiers all, not able to maintain</p>

<p>The many to them longing, have put off</p>

<p>The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,</p>

<p>Unfit for other life, compelled by hunger</p>

<p>And lack of other means, in desperate manner</p>

<p>Daring th’ event to th’ teeth, are all in uproar,</p>

<p>And danger serves among them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Taxation?</p>

<p>Wherein? And what taxation? My Lord Cardinal,</p>

<p>You that are blamed for it alike with us,</p>

<p>Know you of this taxation?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Please you, sir,</p>

<p>I know but of a single part in aught</p>

<p>Pertains to th’ state, and front but in that file</p>

<p>Where others tell steps with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  No, my lord?</p>

<p>You know no more than others? But you frame</p>

<p>Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome</p>

<p>To those which would not know them, and yet must</p>

<p>Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions</p>

<p>Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are</p>

<p>Most pestilent to th’ hearing, and to bear ’em</p>

<p>The back is sacrifice to th’ load. They say</p>

<p>They are devised by you, or else you suffer</p>

<p>Too hard an exclamation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Still exaction!</p>

<p>The nature of it? In what kind, let’s know,</p>

<p>Is this exaction?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  I am much too venturous</p>

<p>In tempting of your patience, but am boldened</p>

<p>Under your promised pardon. The subjects’ grief</p>

<p>Comes through commissions which compels from</p>

<p>each</p>

<p>The sixth part of his substance, to be levied</p>

<p>Without delay, and the pretense for this</p>

<p>Is named your wars in France. This makes bold</p>

<p>mouths.</p>

<p>Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze</p>

<p>Allegiance in them. Their curses now</p>

<p>Live where their prayers did; and it’s come to pass</p>

<p>This tractable obedience is a slave</p>

<p>To each incensed will. I would your Highness</p>

<p>Would give it quick consideration, for</p>

<p>There is no primer baseness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  By my life,</p>

<p>This is against our pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  And for me,</p>

<p>I have no further gone in this than by</p>

<p>A single voice, and that not passed me but</p>

<p>By learned approbation of the judges. If I am</p>

<p>Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know</p>

<p>My faculties nor person, yet will be</p>

<p>The chronicles of my doing, let me say</p>

<p>’Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake</p>

<p>That virtue must go through. We must not stint</p>

<p>Our necessary actions in the fear</p>

<p>To cope malicious censurers, which ever,</p>

<p>As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow</p>

<p>That is new trimmed, but benefit no further</p>

<p>Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,</p>

<p>By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is</p>

<p>Not ours or not allowed; what worst, as oft,</p>

<p>Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up</p>

<p>For our best act. If we shall stand still</p>

<p>In fear our motion will be mocked or carped at,</p>

<p>We should take root here where we sit,</p>

<p>Or sit state-statues only.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Things done well,</p>

<p>And with a care, exempt themselves from fear;</p>

<p>Things done without example, in their issue</p>

<p>Are to be feared. Have you a precedent</p>

<p>Of this commission? I believe, not any.</p>

<p>We must not rend our subjects from our laws</p>

<p>And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?</p>

<p>A trembling contribution! Why, we take</p>

<p>From every tree lop, bark, and part o’ th’ timber,</p>

<p>And though we leave it with a root, thus hacked,</p>

<p>The air will drink the sap. To every county</p>

<p>Where this is questioned send our letters with</p>

<p>Free pardon to each man that has denied</p>

<p>The force of this commission. Pray look to ’t;</p>

<p>I put it to your care.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc> <i>[aside to his Secretary]</i>  A word with you.</p>

<p>Let there be letters writ to every shire</p>

<p>Of the King’s grace and pardon. The grieved commons</p>

<p>Hardly conceive of me. Let it be noised</p>

<p>That through our intercession this revokement</p>

<p>And pardon comes. I shall anon advise you</p>

<p>Further in the proceeding.     <i><i>[Secretary exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Buckingham’s Surveyor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc> <i>[to the King]</i></p>

<p>I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham</p>

<p>Is run in your displeasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  It grieves many.</p>

<p>The gentleman is learned and a most rare speaker;</p>

<p>To nature none more bound; his training such</p>

<p>That he may furnish and instruct great teachers</p>

<p>And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,</p>

<p>When these so noble benefits shall prove</p>

<p>Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,</p>

<p>They turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly</p>

<p>Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,</p>

<p>Who was enrolled ’mongst wonders, and when we</p>

<p>Almost with ravished list’ning could not find</p>

<p>His hour of speech a minute–he, my lady,</p>

<p>Hath into monstrous habits put the graces</p>

<p>That once were his, and is become as black</p>

<p>As if besmeared in hell. Sit by us. You shall hear–</p>

<p>This was his gentleman in trust–of him</p>

<p>Things to strike honor sad.–Bid him recount</p>

<p>The fore-recited practices, whereof</p>

<p>We cannot feel too little, hear too much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you</p>

<p>Most like a careful subject have collected</p>

<p>Out of the Duke of Buckingham.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Speak freely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surveyor</sc></p>

<p>First, it was usual with him–every day</p>

<p>It would infect his speech–that if the King</p>

<p>Should without issue die, he’ll carry it so</p>

<p>To make the scepter his. These very words</p>

<p>I’ve heard him utter to his son-in-law,</p>

<p>Lord Abergavenny, to whom by oath he menaced</p>

<p>Revenge upon the Cardinal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Please your Highness, note</p>

<p>This dangerous conception in this point:</p>

<p>Not friended by his wish to your high person,</p>

<p>His will is most malignant, and it stretches</p>

<p>Beyond you to your friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  My learned Lord Cardinal,</p>

<p>Deliver all with charity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[to Surveyor]</i>  Speak on.</p>

<p>How grounded he his title to the crown</p>

<p>Upon our fail? To this point hast thou heard him</p>

<p>At any time speak aught?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surveyor</sc>  He was brought to this</p>

<p>By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>What was that Henton?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surveyor</sc>  Sir, a Chartreux friar,</p>

<p>His confessor, who fed him every minute</p>

<p>With words of sovereignty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  How know’st thou this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surveyor</sc></p>

<p>Not long before your Highness sped to France,</p>

<p>The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish</p>

<p>Saint Laurence Poultney, did of me demand</p>

<p>What was the speech among the Londoners</p>

<p>Concerning the French journey. I replied</p>

<p>Men fear the French would prove perfidious,</p>

<p>To the King’s danger. Presently the Duke</p>

<p>Said ’twas the fear indeed, and that he doubted</p>

<p>’Twould prove the verity of certain words</p>

<p>Spoke by a holy monk “that oft,” says he,</p>

<p>“Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit</p>

<p>John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour</p>

<p>To hear from him a matter of some moment;</p>

<p>Whom after under the confession’s seal</p>

<p>He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke</p>

<p>My chaplain to no creature living but</p>

<p>To me should utter, with demure confidence</p>

<p>This pausingly ensued: ’Neither the King, nor ’s heirs–</p>

<p>Tell you the Duke–shall prosper. Bid him strive</p>

<p>To gain the love o’ th’ commonalty; the Duke</p>

<p>Shall govern England.’”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  If I know you well,</p>

<p>You were the Duke’s surveyor, and lost your office</p>

<p>On the complaint o’ th’ tenants. Take good heed</p>

<p>You charge not in your spleen a noble person</p>

<p>And spoil your nobler soul. I say, take heed–</p>

<p>Yes, heartily beseech you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Let him on.–</p>

<p>Go forward.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surveyor</sc>  On my soul, I’ll speak but truth.</p>

<p>I told my lord the Duke, by th’ devil’s illusions</p>

<p>The monk might be deceived, and that ’twas dangerous</p>

<p>For him to ruminate on this so far until</p>

<p>It forged him some design, which, being believed,</p>

<p>It was much like to do. He answered “Tush,</p>

<p>It can do me no damage,” adding further</p>

<p>That had the King in his last sickness failed,</p>

<p>The Cardinal’s and Sir Thomas Lovell’s heads</p>

<p>Should have gone off.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Ha! What, so rank? Ah ha!</p>

<p>There’s mischief in this man! Canst thou say further?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surveyor</sc></p>

<p>I can, my liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surveyor</sc>  Being at Greenwich,</p>

<p>After your Highness had reproved the Duke</p>

<p>About Sir William Blumer–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>I remember of such a time, being my sworn servant,</p>

<p>The Duke retained him his. But on. What hence?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surveyor</sc></p>

<p>“If,” quoth he, “I for this had been committed,”</p>

<p>As to the Tower, I thought, “I would have played</p>

<p>The part my father meant to act upon</p>

<p>Th’ usurper Richard, who, being at Salisbury,</p>

<p>Made suit to come in ’s presence; which if granted,</p>

<p>As he made semblance of his duty, would</p>

<p>Have put his knife into him.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  A giant traitor!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom</p>

<p>And this man out of prison?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Katherine</sc>  God mend all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[to Surveyor]</i></p>

<p>There’s something more would out of thee. What sayst?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surveyor</sc></p>

<p>After “the Duke his father” with “the knife,”</p>

<p>He stretched him, and with one hand on his dagger,</p>

<p>Another spread on ’s breast, mounting his eyes,</p>

<p>He did discharge a horrible oath whose tenor</p>

<p>Was, were he evil used, he would outgo</p>

<p>His father by as much as a performance</p>

<p>Does an irresolute purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  There’s his period,</p>

<p>To sheathe his knife in us! He is attached.</p>

<p>Call him to present trial. If he may</p>

<p>Find mercy in the law, ’tis his; if none,</p>

<p>Let him not seek ’t of us. By day and night,</p>

<p>He’s traitor to th’ height!</p>
