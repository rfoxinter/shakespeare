<p><center><i>[Enter the Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Suffolk, Lord Surrey,</p>

<p>and Lord Chamberlain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc></p>

<p>If you will now unite in your complaints</p>

<p>And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal</p>

<p>Cannot stand under them. If you omit</p>

<p>The offer of this time, I cannot promise</p>

<p>But that you shall sustain more new disgraces</p>

<p>With these you bear already.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  I am joyful</p>

<p>To meet the least occasion that may give me</p>

<p>Remembrance of my father-in-law the Duke,</p>

<p>To be revenged on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  Which of the peers</p>

<p>Have uncontemned gone by him, or at least</p>

<p>Strangely neglected? When did he regard</p>

<p>The stamp of nobleness in any person</p>

<p>Out of himself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  My lords, you speak your pleasures;</p>

<p>What he deserves of you and me I know;</p>

<p>What we can do to him–though now the time</p>

<p>Gives way to us–I much fear. If you cannot</p>

<p>Bar his access to th’ King, never attempt</p>

<p>Anything on him, for he hath a witchcraft</p>

<p>Over the King in ’s tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  O, fear him not.</p>

<p>His spell in that is out. The King hath found</p>

<p>Matter against him that forever mars</p>

<p>The honey of his language. No, he’s settled,</p>

<p>Not to come off, in his displeasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  Sir,</p>

<p>I should be glad to hear such news as this</p>

<p>Once every hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  Believe it, this is true.</p>

<p>In the divorce his contrary proceedings</p>

<p>Are all unfolded, wherein he appears</p>

<p>As I would wish mine enemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  How came</p>

<p>His practices to light?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  Most strangely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  O, how, how?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>The Cardinal’s letters to the Pope miscarried</p>

<p>And came to th’ eye o’ th’ King, wherein was read</p>

<p>How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness</p>

<p>To stay the judgment o’ th’ divorce; for if</p>

<p>It did take place, “I do,” quoth he, “perceive</p>

<p>My king is tangled in affection to</p>

<p>A creature of the Queen’s, Lady Anne Bullen.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc></p>

<p>Has the King this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  Believe it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  Will this work?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc></p>

<p>The King in this perceives him how he coasts</p>

<p>And hedges his own way. But in this point</p>

<p>All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic</p>

<p>After his patient’s death: the King already</p>

<p>Hath married the fair lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  Would he had!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>May you be happy in your wish, my lord,</p>

<p>For I profess you have it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  Now, all my joy</p>

<p>Trace the conjunction!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  My amen to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  All men’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>There’s order given for her coronation.</p>

<p>Marry, this is yet but young and may be left</p>

<p>To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,</p>

<p>She is a gallant creature and complete</p>

<p>In mind and feature. I persuade me, from her</p>

<p>Will fall some blessing to this land which shall</p>

<p>In it be memorized.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  But will the King</p>

<p>Digest this letter of the Cardinal’s?</p>

<p>The Lord forbid!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  Marry, amen!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  No, no.</p>

<p>There be more wasps that buzz about his nose</p>

<p>Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius</p>

<p>Is stol’n away to Rome, hath ta’en no leave,</p>

<p>Has left the cause o’ th’ King unhandled, and</p>

<p>Is posted as the agent of our cardinal</p>

<p>To second all his plot. I do assure you</p>

<p>The King cried “Ha!” at this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  Now God incense him,</p>

<p>And let him cry “Ha!” louder.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  But, my lord,</p>

<p>When returns Cranmer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>He is returned in his opinions, which</p>

<p>Have satisfied the King for his divorce,</p>

<p>Together with all famous colleges</p>

<p>Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,</p>

<p>His second marriage shall be published, and</p>

<p>Her coronation. Katherine no more</p>

<p>Shall be called queen, but princess dowager</p>

<p>And widow to Prince Arthur.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  This same Cranmer’s</p>

<p>A worthy fellow, and hath ta’en much pain</p>

<p>In the King’s business.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  He has, and we shall see him</p>

<p>For it an archbishop.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  So I hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  ’Tis so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Wolsey and Cromwell, meeting.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>The Cardinal!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc></p>

<p>Observe, observe; he’s moody.     <i><i>[They stand aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  The packet, Cromwell;</p>

<p>Gave ’t you the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cromwell</sc>  To his own hand, in ’s bedchamber.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>Looked he o’ th’ inside of the paper?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cromwell</sc>  Presently</p>

<p>He did unseal them, and the first he viewed,</p>

<p>He did it with a serious mind; a heed</p>

<p>Was in his countenance. You he bade</p>

<p>Attend him here this morning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Is he ready</p>

<p>To come abroad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cromwell</sc>  I think by this he is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Leave me awhile.     <i><i>[Cromwell exits.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,</p>

<p>The French king’s sister; he shall marry her.</p>

<p>Anne Bullen? No, I’ll no Anne Bullens for him.</p>

<p>There’s more in ’t than fair visage. Bullen?</p>

<p>No, we’ll no Bullens. Speedily I wish</p>

<p>To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc></p>

<p>He’s discontented.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  Maybe he hears the King</p>

<p>Does whet his anger to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  Sharp enough,</p>

<p>Lord, for thy justice!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>The late queen’s gentlewoman, a knight’s daughter,</p>

<p>To be her mistress’ mistress? The Queen’s queen?</p>

<p>This candle burns not clear. ’Tis I must snuff it;</p>

<p>Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous</p>

<p>And well-deserving? Yet I know her for</p>

<p>A spleeny Lutheran, and not wholesome to</p>

<p>Our cause that she should lie i’ th’ bosom of</p>

<p>Our hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up</p>

<p>An heretic, an arch-one, Cranmer, one</p>

<p>Hath crawled into the favor of the King</p>

<p>And is his oracle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  He is vexed at something.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc></p>

<p>I would ’twere something that would fret the string,</p>

<p>The master-cord on ’s heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  The King, the King!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King, reading of a schedule, with Lovell</p>

<p>and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>What piles of wealth hath he accumulated</p>

<p>To his own portion! And what expense by th’ hour</p>

<p>Seems to flow from him! How i’ th’ name of thrift</p>

<p>Does he rake this together? <i>[Seeing the nobles.]</i> Now,</p>

<p>my lords,</p>

<p>Saw you the Cardinal?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc> <i>[indicating Wolsey]</i>  My lord, we have</p>

<p>Stood here observing him. Some strange commotion</p>

<p>Is in his brain. He bites his lip, and starts,</p>

<p>Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,</p>

<p>Then lays his finger on his temple, straight</p>

<p>Springs out into fast gait, then stops again,</p>

<p>Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts</p>

<p>His eye against the moon. In most strange postures</p>

<p>We have seen him set himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  It may well be</p>

<p>There is a mutiny in ’s mind. This morning</p>

<p>Papers of state he sent me to peruse,</p>

<p>As I required, and wot you what I found?</p>

<p>There–on my conscience, put unwittingly–</p>

<p>Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing</p>

<p>The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,</p>

<p>Rich stuffs and ornaments of household, which</p>

<p>I find at such proud rate that it outspeaks</p>

<p>Possession of a subject.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc>  It’s heaven’s will!</p>

<p>Some spirit put this paper in the packet</p>

<p>To bless your eye withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[studying Wolsey]</i>  If we did think</p>

<p>His contemplation were above the Earth</p>

<p>And fixed on spiritual object, he should still</p>

<p>Dwell in his musings, but I am afraid</p>

<p>His thinkings are below the moon, not worth</p>

<p>His serious considering.</p>

<p><center><i>[King takes his seat, whispers Lovell,</p>

<p>who goes to the Cardinal.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Heaven forgive me!</p>

<p>Ever God bless your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Good my lord,</p>

<p>You are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory</p>

<p>Of your best graces in your mind, the which</p>

<p>You were now running o’er. You have scarce time</p>

<p>To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span</p>

<p>To keep your earthly audit. Sure, in that</p>

<p>I deem you an ill husband, and am glad</p>

<p>To have you therein my companion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Sir,</p>

<p>For holy offices I have a time; a time</p>

<p>To think upon the part of business which</p>

<p>I bear i’ th’ state; and Nature does require</p>

<p>Her times of preservation, which perforce</p>

<p>I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,</p>

<p>Must give my tendance to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  You have said well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>And ever may your Highness yoke together,</p>

<p>As I will lend you cause, my doing well</p>

<p>With my well saying.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  ’Tis well said again,</p>

<p>And ’tis a kind of good deed to say well.</p>

<p>And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you;</p>

<p>He said he did, and with his deed did crown</p>

<p>His word upon you. Since I had my office</p>

<p>I have kept you next my heart, have not alone</p>

<p>Employed you where high profits might come home,</p>

<p>But pared my present havings to bestow</p>

<p>My bounties upon you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  What should this mean?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>The Lord increase this business!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Have I not made you</p>

<p>The prime man of the state? I pray you tell me</p>

<p>If what I now pronounce you have found true;</p>

<p>And, if you may confess it, say withal</p>

<p>If you are bound to us or no. What say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,</p>

<p>Showered on me daily, have been more than could</p>

<p>My studied purposes requite, which went</p>

<p>Beyond all man’s endeavors. My endeavors</p>

<p>Have ever come too short of my desires,</p>

<p>Yet filed with my abilities. Mine own ends</p>

<p>Have been mine so, that evermore they pointed</p>

<p>To th’ good of your most sacred person and</p>

<p>The profit of the state. For your great graces</p>

<p>Heaped upon me, poor undeserver, I</p>

<p>Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,</p>

<p>My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,</p>

<p>Which ever has and ever shall be growing</p>

<p>Till death–that winter–kill it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Fairly answered.</p>

<p>A loyal and obedient subject is</p>

<p>Therein illustrated. The honor of it</p>

<p>Does pay the act of it, as, i’ th’ contrary,</p>

<p>The foulness is the punishment. I presume</p>

<p>That, as my hand has opened bounty to you,</p>

<p>My heart dropped love, my power rained honor, more</p>

<p>On you than any, so your hand and heart,</p>

<p>Your brain, and every function of your power</p>

<p>Should–notwithstanding that your bond of duty</p>

<p>As ’twere in love’s particular–be more</p>

<p>To me, your friend, than any.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  I do profess</p>

<p>That for your Highness’ good I ever labored</p>

<p>More than mine own, that am, have, and will be–</p>

<p>Though all the world should crack their duty to you</p>

<p>And throw it from their soul, though perils did</p>

<p>Abound as thick as thought could make ’em, and</p>

<p>Appear in forms more horrid–yet my duty,</p>

<p>As doth a rock against the chiding flood,</p>

<p>Should the approach of this wild river break,</p>

<p>And stand unshaken yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  ’Tis nobly spoken.–</p>

<p>Take notice, lords: he has a loyal breast,</p>

<p>For you have seen him open ’t.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands Wolsey papers.]</i></center></p>

<p>Read o’er this,</p>

<p>And after, this; and then to breakfast with</p>

<p>What appetite you have.</p>

<p><center><i>[King exits, frowning upon the Cardinal;</p>

<p>the nobles throng after him smiling</p>

<p>and whispering, and exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  What should this mean?</p>

<p>What sudden anger’s this? How have I reaped it?</p>

<p>He parted frowning from me, as if ruin</p>

<p>Leaped from his eyes. So looks the chafed lion</p>

<p>Upon the daring huntsman that has galled him,</p>

<p>Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper–</p>

<p>I fear, the story of his anger.</p>

<p><center><i>[He reads one of the papers.]</i></center></p>

<p>’Tis so.</p>

<p>This paper has undone me. ’Tis th’ accompt</p>

<p>Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together</p>

<p>For mine own ends–indeed, to gain the popedom</p>

<p>And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence,</p>

<p>Fit for a fool to fall by! What cross devil</p>

<p>Made me put this main secret in the packet</p>

<p>I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?</p>

<p>No new device to beat this from his brains?</p>

<p>I know ’twill stir him strongly; yet I know</p>

<p>A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune</p>

<p>Will bring me off again.     <i><i>[He looks at another paper.]</i></i></p>

<p>What’s this? “To th’ Pope”?</p>

<p>The letter, as I live, with all the business</p>

<p>I writ to ’s Holiness. Nay then, farewell!</p>

<p>I have touched the highest point of all my greatness,</p>

<p>And from that full meridian of my glory</p>

<p>I haste now to my setting. I shall fall</p>

<p>Like a bright exhalation in the evening</p>

<p>And no man see me more.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter to Wolsey the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc></p>

<p>Hear the King’s pleasure, cardinal, who commands</p>

<p>you</p>

<p>To render up the great seal presently</p>

<p>Into our hands, and to confine yourself</p>

<p>To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester’s,</p>

<p>Till you hear further from his Highness.</p>

<p>Where’s your commission, lords? Words cannot carry</p>

<p>Authority so weighty.</p>

<p>Bearing the King’s will from his mouth expressly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>Till I find more than will or words to do it–</p>

<p>I mean your malice–know, officious lords,</p>

<p>I dare and must deny it. Now I feel</p>

<p>Of what coarse metal you are molded, envy;</p>

<p>How eagerly you follow my disgraces,</p>

<p>As if it fed you, and how sleek and wanton</p>

<p>You appear in everything may bring my ruin.</p>

<p>Follow your envious courses, men of malice;</p>

<p>You have Christian warrant for ’em, and no doubt</p>

<p>In time will find their fit rewards. That seal</p>

<p>You ask with such a violence, the King,</p>

<p>Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;</p>

<p>Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honors,</p>

<p>During my life; and to confirm his goodness,</p>

<p>Tied it by letters patents. Now, who’ll take it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc></p>

<p>The King that gave it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  It must be himself, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc></p>

<p>Thou art a proud traitor, priest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Proud lord, thou liest.</p>

<p>Within these forty hours Surrey durst better</p>

<p>Have burnt that tongue than said so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  Thy ambition,</p>

<p>Thou scarlet sin, robbed this bewailing land</p>

<p>Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law.</p>

<p>The heads of all thy brother cardinals,</p>

<p>With thee and all thy best parts bound together,</p>

<p>Weighed not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!</p>

<p>You sent me Deputy for Ireland,</p>

<p>Far from his succor, from the King, from all</p>

<p>That might have mercy on the fault thou gav’st him,</p>

<p>Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,</p>

<p>Absolved him with an ax.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  This, and all else</p>

<p>This talking lord can lay upon my credit,</p>

<p>I answer, is most false. The Duke by law</p>

<p>Found his deserts. How innocent I was</p>

<p>From any private malice in his end,</p>

<p>His noble jury and foul cause can witness.–</p>

<p>If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you</p>

<p>You have as little honesty as honor,</p>

<p>That in the way of loyalty and truth</p>

<p>Toward the King, my ever royal master,</p>

<p>Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,</p>

<p>And all that love his follies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  By my soul,</p>

<p>Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou shouldst feel</p>

<p>My sword i’ th’ life blood of thee else.–My lords,</p>

<p>Can you endure to hear this arrogance?</p>

<p>And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,</p>

<p>To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,</p>

<p>Farewell, nobility. Let his Grace go forward</p>

<p>And dare us with his cap, like larks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  All goodness</p>

<p>Is poison to thy stomach.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  Yes, that goodness</p>

<p>Of gleaning all the land’s wealth into one,</p>

<p>Into your own hands, card’nal, by extortion;</p>

<p>The goodness of your intercepted packets</p>

<p>You writ to th’ Pope against the King. Your goodness,</p>

<p>Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.–</p>

<p>My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,</p>

<p>As you respect the common good, the state</p>

<p>Of our despised nobility, our issues,</p>

<p>Whom, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,</p>

<p>Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles</p>

<p>Collected from his life.–I’ll startle you</p>

<p>Worse than the sacring bell when the brown wench</p>

<p>Lay kissing in your arms, Lord Cardinal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>How much, methinks, I could despise this man,</p>

<p>But that I am bound in charity against it!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc></p>

<p>Those articles, my lord, are in the King’s hand;</p>

<p>But thus much, they are foul ones.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  So much fairer</p>

<p>And spotless shall mine innocence arise</p>

<p>When the King knows my truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  This cannot save you.</p>

<p>I thank my memory I yet remember</p>

<p>Some of these articles, and out they shall.</p>

<p>Now, if you can blush and cry “Guilty,” cardinal,</p>

<p>You’ll show a little honesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Speak on, sir.</p>

<p>I dare your worst objections. If I blush,</p>

<p>It is to see a nobleman want manners.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc></p>

<p>I had rather want those than my head. Have at you:</p>

<p>First, that without the King’s assent or knowledge,</p>

<p>You wrought to be a legate, by which power</p>

<p>You maimed the jurisdiction of all bishops.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc></p>

<p>Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else</p>

<p>To foreign princes, “ego et rex meus”</p>

<p>Was still inscribed, in which you brought the King</p>

<p>To be your servant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  Then, that without the knowledge</p>

<p>Either of king or council, when you went</p>

<p>Ambassador to the Emperor, you made bold</p>

<p>To carry into Flanders the great seal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc></p>

<p>Item, you sent a large commission</p>

<p>To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,</p>

<p>Without the King’s will or the state’s allowance,</p>

<p>A league between his Highness and Ferrara.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>That out of mere ambition you have caused</p>

<p>Your holy hat to be stamped on the King’s coin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc></p>

<p>Then, that you have sent innumerable substance–</p>

<p>By what means got I leave to your own conscience–</p>

<p>To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways</p>

<p>You have for dignities, to the mere undoing</p>

<p>Of all the kingdom. Many more there are</p>

<p>Which, since they are of you, and odious,</p>

<p>I will not taint my mouth with.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  O, my lord,</p>

<p>Press not a falling man too far! ’Tis virtue.</p>

<p>His faults lie open to the laws; let them,</p>

<p>Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him</p>

<p>So little of his great self.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  I forgive him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Lord Cardinal, the King’s further pleasure is–</p>

<p>Because all those things you have done of late</p>

<p>By your power legative within this kingdom</p>

<p>Fall into th’ compass of a praemunire–</p>

<p>That therefore such a writ be sued against you,</p>

<p>To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,</p>

<p>Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be</p>

<p>Out of the King’s protection. This is my charge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Norfolk</sc></p>

<p>And so we’ll leave you to your meditations</p>

<p>How to live better. For your stubborn answer</p>

<p>About the giving back the great seal to us,</p>

<p>The King shall know it and, no doubt, shall thank</p>

<p>you.</p>

<p>So, fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>So, farewell to the little good you bear me.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Wolsey exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Farewell? A long farewell to all my greatness!</p>

<p>This is the state of man: today he puts forth</p>

<p>The tender leaves of hopes; tomorrow blossoms</p>

<p>And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;</p>

<p>The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,</p>

<p>And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely</p>

<p>His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,</p>

<p>And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,</p>

<p>Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,</p>

<p>This many summers in a sea of glory,</p>

<p>But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride</p>

<p>At length broke under me and now has left me,</p>

<p>Weary and old with service, to the mercy</p>

<p>Of a rude stream that must forever hide me.</p>

<p>Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate you.</p>

<p>I feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched</p>

<p>Is that poor man that hangs on princes’ favors!</p>

<p>There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,</p>

<p>That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,</p>

<p>More pangs and fears than wars or women have;</p>

<p>And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,</p>

<p>Never to hope again.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cromwell, standing amazed.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Why, how now, Cromwell?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cromwell</sc></p>

<p>I have no power to speak, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  What, amazed</p>

<p>At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder</p>

<p>A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,</p>

<p>I am fall’n indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cromwell</sc>  How does your Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Why, well.</p>

<p>Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.</p>

<p>I know myself now, and I feel within me</p>

<p>A peace above all earthly dignities,</p>

<p>A still and quiet conscience. The King has cured me–</p>

<p>I humbly thank his Grace–and from these shoulders,</p>

<p>These ruined pillars, out of pity, taken</p>

<p>A load would sink a navy: too much honor.</p>

<p>O, ’tis a burden, Cromwell, ’tis a burden</p>

<p>Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cromwell</sc></p>

<p>I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>I hope I have. I am able now, methinks,</p>

<p>Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,</p>

<p>To endure more miseries and greater far</p>

<p>Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.</p>

<p>What news abroad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cromwell</sc>  The heaviest and the worst</p>

<p>Is your displeasure with the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  God bless him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cromwell</sc></p>

<p>The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen</p>

<p>Lord Chancellor in your place.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  That’s somewhat sudden.</p>

<p>But he’s a learned man. May he continue</p>

<p>Long in his Highness’ favor and do justice</p>

<p>For truth’s sake and his conscience, that his bones,</p>

<p>When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,</p>

<p>May have a tomb of orphans’ tears wept on him.</p>

<p>What more?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cromwell</sc>  That Cranmer is returned with welcome,</p>

<p>Installed Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>That’s news indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cromwell</sc>  Last, that the Lady Anne,</p>

<p>Whom the King hath in secrecy long married,</p>

<p>This day was viewed in open as his queen,</p>

<p>Going to chapel, and the voice is now</p>

<p>Only about her coronation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>There was the weight that pulled me down.</p>

<p>O Cromwell,</p>

<p>The King has gone beyond me. All my glories</p>

<p>In that one woman I have lost forever.</p>

<p>No sun shall ever usher forth mine honors,</p>

<p>Or gild again the noble troops that waited</p>

<p>Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell.</p>

<p>I am a poor fall’n man, unworthy now</p>

<p>To be thy lord and master. Seek the King;</p>

<p>That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him</p>

<p>What and how true thou art. He will advance thee;</p>

<p>Some little memory of me will stir him–</p>

<p>I know his noble nature–not to let</p>

<p>Thy hopeful service perish too. Good Cromwell,</p>

<p>Neglect him not. Make use now, and provide</p>

<p>For thine own future safety.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cromwell</sc> <i>[weeping]</i>  O, my lord,</p>

<p>Must I then leave you? Must I needs forgo</p>

<p>So good, so noble, and so true a master?</p>

<p>Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,</p>

<p>With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.</p>

<p>The King shall have my service, but my prayers</p>

<p>Forever and forever shall be yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc> <i>[weeping]</i></p>

<p>Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear</p>

<p>In all my miseries, but thou hast forced me,</p>

<p>Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.</p>

<p>Let’s dry our eyes. And thus far hear me, Cromwell,</p>

<p>And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,</p>

<p>And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention</p>

<p>Of me more must be heard of, say I taught thee;</p>

<p>Say Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory</p>

<p>And sounded all the depths and shoals of honor,</p>

<p>Found thee a way, out of his wrack, to rise in,</p>

<p>A sure and safe one, though thy master missed it.</p>

<p>Mark but my fall and that that ruined me.</p>

<p>Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition!</p>

<p>By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,</p>

<p>The image of his maker, hope to win by it?</p>

<p>Love thyself last; cherish those hearts that hate thee.</p>

<p>Corruption wins not more than honesty.</p>

<p>Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace</p>

<p>To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not.</p>

<p>Let all the ends thou aim’st at be thy country’s,</p>

<p>Thy God’s, and truth’s. Then if thou fall’st, O Cromwell,</p>

<p>Thou fall’st a blessed martyr.</p>

<p>Serve the King. And, prithee, lead me in.</p>

<p>There take an inventory of all I have</p>

<p>To the last penny; ’tis the King’s. My robe</p>

<p>And my integrity to heaven is all</p>

<p>I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell,</p>

<p>Had I but served my God with half the zeal</p>

<p>I served my king, He would not in mine age</p>

<p>Have left me naked to mine enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cromwell</sc></p>

<p>Good sir, have patience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  So I have. Farewell,</p>

<p>The hopes of court! My hopes in heaven do dwell.</p>
