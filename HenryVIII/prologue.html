<p><sc>Prologue</sc></p>

<p>I come no more to make you laugh. Things now</p>

<p>That bear a weighty and a serious brow,</p>

<p>Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,</p>

<p>Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</p>

<p>We now present. Those that can pity here</p>

<p>May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;</p>

<p>The subject will deserve it. Such as give</p>

<p>Their money out of hope they may believe</p>

<p>May here find truth too. Those that come to see</p>

<p>Only a show or two, and so agree</p>

<p>The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</p>

<p>I’ll undertake may see away their shilling</p>

<p>Richly in two short hours. Only they</p>

<p>That come to hear a merry, bawdy play,</p>

<p>A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</p>

<p>In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</p>

<p>Will be deceived. For, gentle hearers, know</p>

<p>To rank our chosen truth with such a show</p>

<p>As fool and fight is, besides forfeiting</p>

<p>Our own brains and the opinion that we bring</p>

<p>To make that only true we now intend,</p>

<p>Will leave us never an understanding friend.</p>

<p>Therefore, for goodness’ sake, and as you are known</p>

<p>The first and happiest hearers of the town,</p>

<p>Be sad, as we would make you. Think you see</p>

<p>The very persons of our noble story</p>

<p>As they were living. Think you see them great,</p>

<p>And followed with the general throng and sweat</p>

<p>Of thousand friends. Then, in a moment, see</p>

<p>How soon this mightiness meets misery.</p>

<p>And if you can be merry then, I’ll say</p>

<p>A man may weep upon his wedding day.</p>
