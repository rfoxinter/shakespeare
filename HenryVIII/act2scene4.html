<p>him, the Bishops of Lincoln, Ely, Rochester, and Saint</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  What’s the need?</p>

<p>It hath already publicly been read,</p>

<p>And on all sides th’ authority allowed.</p>

<p>You may then spare that time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Crier</span>  Katherine Queen of England, come into the</p>

<p>court.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Queen makes no answer, rises out of her</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Sir, I desire you do me right and justice,</p>

<p>And to bestow your pity on me; for</p>

<p>I am a most poor woman and a stranger,</p>

<p>Born out of your dominions, having here</p>

<p>No judge indifferent nor no more assurance</p>

<p>Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,</p>

<p>In what have I offended you? What cause</p>

<p>Hath my behavior given to your displeasure</p>

<p>That thus you should proceed to put me off</p>

<p>And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness</p>

<p>I have been to you a true and humble wife,</p>

<p>At all times to your will conformable,</p>

<p>Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,</p>

<p>Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry</p>

<p>As I saw it inclined. When was the hour</p>

<p>I ever contradicted your desire,</p>

<p>Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends</p>

<p>Have I not strove to love, although I knew</p>

<p>He were mine enemy? What friend of mine</p>

<p>That had to him derived your anger did I</p>

<p>Continue in my liking? Nay, gave notice</p>

<p>He was from thence discharged? Sir, call to mind</p>

<p>That I have been your wife in this obedience</p>

<p>Upward of twenty years, and have been blessed</p>

<p>With many children by you. If, in the course</p>

<p>And process of this time, you can report,</p>

<p>And prove it too, against mine honor aught,</p>

<p>My bond to wedlock or my love and duty</p>

<p>Against your sacred person, in God’s name</p>

<p>Turn me away and let the foul’st contempt</p>

<p>Shut door upon me, and so give me up</p>

<p>To the sharp’st kind of justice. Please you, sir,</p>

<p>The King your father was reputed for</p>

<p>A prince most prudent, of an excellent</p>

<p>And unmatched wit and judgment. Ferdinand,</p>

<p>My father, King of Spain, was reckoned one</p>

<p>The wisest prince that there had reigned by many</p>

<p>A year before. It is not to be questioned</p>

<p>That they had gathered a wise council to them</p>

<p>Of every realm, that did debate this business,</p>

<p>Who deemed our marriage lawful. Wherefore I humbly</p>

<p>Beseech you, sir, to spare me till I may</p>

<p>Be by my friends in Spain advised, whose counsel</p>

<p>I will implore. If not, i’ th’ name of God,</p>

<p>Your pleasure be fulfilled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span>  You have here, lady,</p>

<p>And of your choice, these reverend fathers, men</p>

<p>Of singular integrity and learning,</p>

<p>Yea, the elect o’ th’ land, who are assembled</p>

<p>To plead your cause. It shall be therefore bootless</p>

<p>That longer you desire the court, as well</p>

<p>For your own quiet as to rectify</p>

<p>What is unsettled in the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Campeius</span>  His Grace</p>

<p>Hath spoken well and justly. Therefore, madam,</p>

<p>It’s fit this royal session do proceed</p>

<p>And that without delay their arguments</p>

<p>Be now produced and heard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  Lord Cardinal,</p>

<p>To you I speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span>  Your pleasure, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  Sir,</p>

<p>I am about to weep; but thinking that</p>

<p>We are a queen, or long have dreamed so, certain</p>

<p>The daughter of a king, my drops of tears</p>

<p>I’ll turn to sparks of fire.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span>  Be patient yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>I will, when you are humble; nay, before,</p>

<p>Or God will punish me. I do believe,</p>

<p>Induced by potent circumstances, that</p>

<p>You are mine enemy, and make my challenge</p>

<p>You shall not be my judge; for it is you</p>

<p>Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me–</p>

<p>Which God’s dew quench! Therefore I say again,</p>

<p>I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul</p>

<p>Refuse you for my judge, whom, yet once more,</p>

<p>I hold my most malicious foe and think not</p>

<p>At all a friend to truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span>  I do profess</p>

<p>You speak not like yourself, who ever yet</p>

<p>Have stood to charity and displayed th’ effects</p>

<p>Of disposition gentle and of wisdom</p>

<p>O’ertopping woman’s power. Madam, you do me</p>

<p>wrong.</p>

<p>I have no spleen against you, nor injustice</p>

<p>For you or any. How far I have proceeded,</p>

<p>Or how far further shall, is warranted</p>

<p>By a commission from the Consistory,</p>

<p>Yea, the whole Consistory of Rome. You charge me</p>

<p>That I “have blown this coal.” I do deny it.</p>

<p>The King is present. If it be known to him</p>

<p>That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,</p>

<p>And worthily, my falsehood, yea, as much</p>

<p>As you have done my truth. If he know</p>

<p>That I am free of your report, he knows</p>

<p>I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him</p>

<p>It lies to cure me, and the cure is to</p>

<p>Remove these thoughts from you, the which before</p>

<p>His Highness shall speak in, I do beseech</p>

<p>You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking</p>

<p>And to say so no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  My lord, my lord,</p>

<p>I am a simple woman, much too weak</p>

<p>T’ oppose your cunning. You’re meek and</p>

<p>humble-mouthed;</p>

<p>You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,</p>

<p>With meekness and humility, but your heart</p>

<p>Is crammed with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.</p>

<p>You have by fortune and his Highness’ favors</p>

<p>Gone slightly o’er low steps, and now are mounted</p>

<p>Where powers are your retainers, and your words,</p>

<p>Domestics to you, serve your will as ’t please</p>

<p>Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,</p>

<p>You tender more your person’s honor than</p>

<p>Your high profession spiritual, that again</p>

<p>I do refuse you for my judge, and here,</p>

<p>Before you all, appeal unto the Pope</p>

<p>To bring my whole cause ’fore his Holiness,</p>

<p>And to be judged by him.</p>

<p><center><i>[She curtsies to the King, and offers to depart.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Campeius</span>  The Queen is obstinate,</p>

<p>Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and</p>

<p>Disdainful to be tried by ’t. ’Tis not well.</p>

<p>She’s going away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Call her again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Crier</span>  Katherine, Queen of England, come into the</p>

<p>court.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span> <span class='sc'>Usher</span>  Madam, you are called back.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>What need you note it? Pray you, keep your way.</p>

<p>When you are called, return. Now, the Lord help!</p>

<p>They vex me past my patience. Pray you, pass on.</p>

<p>I will not tarry; no, nor ever more</p>

<p>Upon this business my appearance make</p>

<p>In any of their courts.</p>

<p><center><i>[Queen and her Attendants exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Go thy ways, Kate.</p>

<p>That man i’ th’ world who shall report he has</p>

<p>A better wife, let him in naught be trusted,</p>

<p>For speaking false in that. Thou art, alone–</p>

<p>If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,</p>

<p>Thy meekness saintlike, wifelike government,</p>

<p>Obeying in commanding, and thy parts</p>

<p>Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out–</p>

<p>The queen of earthly queens. She’s noble born,</p>

<p>And like her true nobility she has</p>

<p>Carried herself towards me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span>  Most gracious sir,</p>

<p>In humblest manner I require your Highness</p>

<p>That it shall please you to declare in hearing</p>

<p>Of all these ears–for where I am robbed and bound,</p>

<p>There must I be unloosed, although not there</p>

<p>At once and fully satisfied–whether ever I</p>

<p>Did broach this business to your Highness, or</p>

<p>Laid any scruple in your way which might</p>

<p>Induce you to the question on ’t, or ever</p>

<p>Have to you, but with thanks to God for such</p>

<p>A royal lady, spake one the least word that might</p>

<p>Be to the prejudice of her present state,</p>

<p>Or touch of her good person?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  My Lord Cardinal,</p>

<p>I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honor,</p>

<p>I free you from ’t. You are not to be taught</p>

<p>That you have many enemies that know not</p>

<p>Why they are so but, like to village curs,</p>

<p>Bark when their fellows do. By some of these</p>

<p>The Queen is put in anger. You’re excused.</p>

<p>But will you be more justified? You ever</p>

<p>Have wished the sleeping of this business, never</p>

<p>desired</p>

<p>It to be stirred, but oft have hindered, oft,</p>

<p>The passages made toward it. On my honor</p>

<p>I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point</p>

<p>And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to ’t,</p>

<p>I will be bold with time and your attention.</p>

<p>Then mark th’ inducement. Thus it came; give heed</p>

<p>to ’t:</p>

<p>My conscience first received a tenderness,</p>

<p>Scruple, and prick on certain speeches uttered</p>

<p>By th’ Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador,</p>

<p>Who had been hither sent on the debating</p>

<p>A marriage ’twixt the Duke of Orleans and</p>

<p>Our daughter Mary. I’ th’ progress of this business,</p>

<p>Ere a determinate resolution, he,</p>

<p>I mean the Bishop, did require a respite</p>

<p>Wherein he might the King his lord advertise</p>

<p>Whether our daughter were legitimate,</p>

<p>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</p>

<p>Sometime our brother’s wife. This respite shook</p>

<p>The bosom of my conscience, entered me,</p>

<p>Yea, with a spitting power, and made to tremble</p>

<p>The region of my breast; which forced such way</p>

<p>That many mazed considerings did throng</p>

<p>And pressed in with this caution. First, methought</p>

<p>I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had</p>

<p>Commanded nature that my lady’s womb,</p>

<p>If it conceived a male child by me, should</p>

<p>Do no more offices of life to ’t than</p>

<p>The grave does to th’ dead, for her male issue</p>

<p>Or died where they were made, or shortly after</p>

<p>This world had aired them. Hence I took a thought</p>

<p>This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom,</p>

<p>Well worthy the best heir o’ th’ world, should not</p>

<p>Be gladded in ’t by me. Then follows that</p>

<p>I weighed the danger which my realms stood in</p>

<p>By this my issue’s fail, and that gave to me</p>

<p>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</p>

<p>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</p>

<p>Toward this remedy whereupon we are</p>

<p>Now present here together. That’s to say,</p>

<p>I meant to rectify my conscience, which</p>

<p>I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,</p>

<p>By all the reverend fathers of the land</p>

<p>And doctors learned. First, I began in private</p>

<p>With you, my Lord of Lincoln. You remember</p>

<p>How under my oppression I did reek</p>

<p>When I first moved you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lincoln</span>  Very well, my liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>I have spoke long. Be pleased yourself to say</p>

<p>How far you satisfied me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lincoln</span>  So please your Highness,</p>

<p>The question did at first so stagger me,</p>

<p>Bearing a state of mighty moment in ’t</p>

<p>And consequence of dread, that I committed</p>

<p>The daring’st counsel which I had to doubt,</p>

<p>And did entreat your Highness to this course</p>

<p>Which you are running here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  I then moved you,</p>

<p>My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave</p>

<p>To make this present summons. Unsolicited</p>

<p>I left no reverend person in this court,</p>

<p>But by particular consent proceeded</p>

<p>Under your hands and seals. Therefore go on,</p>

<p>For no dislike i’ th’ world against the person</p>

<p>Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points</p>

<p>Of my alleged reasons drives this forward.</p>

<p>Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life</p>

<p>And kingly dignity, we are contented</p>

<p>To wear our mortal state to come with her,</p>

<p>Katherine our queen, before the primest creature</p>

<p>That’s paragoned o’ th’ world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Campeius</span>  So please your Highness,</p>

<p>The Queen being absent, ’tis a needful fitness</p>

<p>That we adjourn this court till further day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile must be an earnest motion</p>

<p>Made to the Queen to call back her appeal</p>

<p>She intends unto his Holiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[aside]</i>  I may perceive</p>

<p>These cardinals trifle with me. I abhor</p>

<p>This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.</p>

<p>My learned and well-beloved servant Cranmer,</p>

<p>Prithee return. With thy approach, I know,</p>

<p>My comfort comes along.–Break up the court.</p>

<p>I say, set on.</p>
