<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Chamberlain, reading this letter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  My lord, the horses your Lordship sent</p>

<p>for, with all the care I had I saw well chosen, ridden,</p>

<p>and furnished. They were young and handsome and</p>

<p>of the best breed in the north. When they were ready</p>

<p>to set out for London, a man of my Lord Cardinal’s,</p>

<p>by commission and main power, took ’em from me</p>

<p>with this reason: his master would be served before</p>

<p>a subject, if not before the King, which stopped our</p>

<p>mouths, sir.</p>

<p>I fear he will indeed; well, let him have them.</p>

<p>He will have all, I think.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter to the Lord Chamberlain, the Dukes</p>

<p>of Norfolk and Suffolk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Well met, my Lord Chamberlain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  Good day to both your Graces.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>How is the King employed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  I left him private,</p>

<p>Full of sad thoughts and troubles.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  What’s the cause?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span></p>

<p>It seems the marriage with his brother’s wife</p>

<p>Has crept too near his conscience.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  No, his conscience</p>

<p>Has crept too near another lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  ’Tis so;</p>

<p>This is the Cardinal’s doing. The king-cardinal,</p>

<p>That blind priest, like the eldest son of Fortune,</p>

<p>Turns what he list. The King will know him one day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Pray God he do! He’ll never know himself else.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span></p>

<p>How holily he works in all his business,</p>

<p>And with what zeal! For, now he has cracked the</p>

<p>league</p>

<p>Between us and the Emperor, the Queen’s</p>

<p>great-nephew,</p>

<p>He dives into the King’s soul and there scatters</p>

<p>Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,</p>

<p>Fears and despairs–and all these for his marriage.</p>

<p>And out of all these to restore the King,</p>

<p>He counsels a divorce, a loss of her</p>

<p>That like a jewel has hung twenty years</p>

<p>About his neck, yet never lost her luster;</p>

<p>Of her that loves him with that excellence</p>

<p>That angels love good men with; even of her</p>

<p>That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,</p>

<p>Will bless the King. And is not this course pious?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span></p>

<p>Heaven keep me from such counsel! ’Tis most true:</p>

<p>These news are everywhere, every tongue speaks ’em,</p>

<p>And every true heart weeps for ’t. All that dare</p>

<p>Look into these affairs see this main end,</p>

<p>The French king’s sister. Heaven will one day open</p>

<p>The King’s eyes, that so long have slept upon</p>

<p>This bold bad man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  And free us from his slavery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  We had need pray,</p>

<p>And heartily, for our deliverance,</p>

<p>Or this imperious man will work us all</p>

<p>From princes into pages. All men’s honors</p>

<p>Lie like one lump before him, to be fashioned</p>

<p>Into what pitch he please.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  For me, my lords,</p>

<p>I love him not nor fear him; there’s my creed.</p>

<p>As I am made without him, so I’ll stand,</p>

<p>If the King please. His curses and his blessings</p>

<p>Touch me alike: they’re breath I not believe in.</p>

<p>I knew him and I know him; so I leave him</p>

<p>To him that made him proud, the Pope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Let’s in,</p>

<p>And with some other business put the King</p>

<p>From these sad thoughts that work too much upon</p>

<p>him.–</p>

<p>My lord, you’ll bear us company?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  Excuse me;</p>

<p>The King has sent me otherwhere. Besides,</p>

<p>You’ll find a most unfit time to disturb him.</p>

<p>Health to your Lordships.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Thanks, my good Lord</p>

<p>Chamberlain.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lord Chamberlain exits; and the King draws</p>

<p>the curtain and sits reading pensively.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[to Norfolk]</i></p>

<p>How sad he looks! Sure he is much afflicted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Who’s there? Ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span> <i>[to Suffolk]</i>  Pray God he be not angry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Who’s there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves</p>

<p>Into my private meditations? Who am I, ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span></p>

<p>A gracious king that pardons all offenses</p>

<p>Malice ne’er meant. Our breach of duty this way</p>

<p>Is business of estate, in which we come</p>

<p>To know your royal pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  You are too bold.</p>

<p>Go to; I’ll make you know your times of business.</p>

<p>Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Wolsey and Campeius, with a commission.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Who’s there? My good Lord Cardinal? O my Wolsey,</p>

<p>The quiet of my wounded conscience,</p>

<p>Thou art a cure fit for a king. <i>[To Campeius.]</i> You’re</p>

<p>welcome,</p>

<p>Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom.</p>

<p>Use us and it.–My good lord, have great care</p>

<p>I be not found a talker.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span>  Sir, you cannot.</p>

<p>I would your Grace would give us but an hour</p>

<p>Of private conference.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[to Norfolk and Suffolk]</i>  We are busy. Go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span> <i>[aside to Suffolk]</i></p>

<p>This priest has no pride in him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[aside to Norfolk]</i>  Not to speak of.</p>

<p>I would not be so sick, though for his place.</p>

<p>But this cannot continue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span> <i>[aside to Suffolk]</i>  If it do,</p>

<p>I’ll venture one have-at-him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[aside to Norfolk]</i>  I another.</p>

<p><center><i>[Norfolk and Suffolk exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span></p>

<p>Your Grace has given a precedent of wisdom</p>

<p>Above all princes in committing freely</p>

<p>Your scruple to the voice of Christendom.</p>

<p>Who can be angry now? What envy reach you?</p>

<p>The Spaniard, tied by blood and favor to her,</p>

<p>Must now confess, if they have any goodness,</p>

<p>The trial just and noble; all the clerks–</p>

<p>I mean the learned ones in Christian kingdoms–</p>

<p>Have their free voices; Rome, the nurse of judgment,</p>

<p>Invited by your noble self, hath sent</p>

<p>One general tongue unto us, this good man,</p>

<p>This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius,</p>

<p>Whom once more I present unto your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,</p>

<p>And thank the holy conclave for their loves.</p>

<p>They have sent me such a man I would have wished</p>

<p>for.     <i><i>[He embraces Campeius.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Campeius</span> <i>[handing the King a paper]</i></p>

<p>Your Grace must needs deserve all strangers’ loves,</p>

<p>You are so noble. To your Highness’ hand</p>

<p>I tender my commission–by whose virtue,</p>

<p>The court of Rome commanding, you, my Lord</p>

<p>Cardinal of York, are joined with me their servant</p>

<p>In the unpartial judging of this business.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Two equal men. The Queen shall be acquainted</p>

<p>Forthwith for what you come. Where’s Gardiner?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span></p>

<p>I know your Majesty has always loved her</p>

<p>So dear in heart not to deny her that</p>

<p>A woman of less place might ask by law:</p>

<p>Scholars allowed freely to argue for her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Ay, and the best she shall have, and my favor</p>

<p>To him that does best. God forbid else. Cardinal,</p>

<p>Prithee call Gardiner to me, my new secretary.</p>

<p>I find him a fit fellow.     <i><i>[Wolsey goes to the door.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gardiner to Wolsey.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span> <i>[aside to Gardiner]</i></p>

<p>Give me your hand. Much joy and favor to you.</p>

<p>You are the King’s now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span> <i>[aside to Wolsey]</i>  But to be commanded</p>

<p>Forever by your Grace, whose hand has raised me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Come hither, Gardiner.</p>

<p><center><i>[The King and Gardiner walk and whisper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Campeius</span></p>

<p>My lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace</p>

<p>In this man’s place before him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span>  Yes, he was.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Campeius</span></p>

<p>Was he not held a learned man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span>  Yes, surely.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Campeius</span></p>

<p>Believe me, there’s an ill opinion spread, then,</p>

<p>Even of yourself, Lord Cardinal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span>  How? Of me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Campeius</span></p>

<p>They will not stick to say you envied him</p>

<p>And, fearing he would rise–he was so virtuous–</p>

<p>Kept him a foreign man still, which so grieved him</p>

<p>That he ran mad and died.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span>  Heav’n’s peace be with him!</p>

<p>That’s Christian care enough. For living murmurers,</p>

<p>There’s places of rebuke. He was a fool,</p>

<p>For he would needs be virtuous. That good fellow</p>

<p>If I command him follows my appointment.</p>

<p>I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother:</p>

<p>We live not to be griped by meaner persons.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[to Gardiner]</i></p>

<p>Deliver this with modesty to th’ Queen.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gardiner exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>The most convenient place that I can think of</p>

<p>For such receipt of learning is Blackfriars.</p>

<p>There you shall meet about this weighty business.</p>

<p>My Wolsey, see it furnished. O, my lord,</p>

<p>Would it not grieve an able man to leave</p>

<p>So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!</p>

<p>O, ’tis a tender place, and I must leave her.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
