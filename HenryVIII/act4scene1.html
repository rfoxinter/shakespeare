<p><center><i>[Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another, the First</p>

<p>Gentleman carrying a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>You’re well met once again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  So are you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>You come to take your stand here and behold</p>

<p>The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>’Tis all my business. At our last encounter,</p>

<p>The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>’Tis very true. But that time offered sorrow,</p>

<p>This general joy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  ’Tis well. The citizens</p>

<p>I am sure have shown at full their royal minds,</p>

<p>As, let ’em have their rights, they are ever forward</p>

<p>In celebration of this day with shows,</p>

<p>Pageants, and sights of honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Never greater,</p>

<p>Nor, I’ll assure you, better taken, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>May I be bold to ask what that contains,</p>

<p>That paper in your hand?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Yes, ’tis the list</p>

<p>Of those that claim their offices this day</p>

<p>By custom of the coronation.</p>

<p>The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims</p>

<p>To be High Steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,</p>

<p>He to be Earl Marshal. You may read the rest.</p>

<p><center><i>[He offers him the paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>I thank you, sir. Had I not known those customs,</p>

<p>I should have been beholding to your paper.</p>

<p>But I beseech you, what’s become of Katherine,</p>

<p>The Princess Dowager? How goes her business?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>That I can tell you too. The Archbishop</p>

<p>Of Canterbury, accompanied with other</p>

<p>Learned and reverend fathers of his order,</p>

<p>Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off</p>

<p>From Ampthill, where the Princess lay, to which</p>

<p>She was often cited by them, but appeared not;</p>

<p>And, to be short, for not appearance and</p>

<p>The King’s late scruple, by the main assent</p>

<p>Of all these learned men she was divorced,</p>

<p>And the late marriage made of none effect;</p>

<p>Since which she was removed to Kymmalton,</p>

<p>Where she remains now sick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Alas, good lady!</p>

<p><center><i>[Hautboys. A lively flourish of trumpets.]</i></center></p>

<p>The trumpets sound. Stand close. The Queen is coming.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Then, enter two Judges; Lord Chancellor, with purse</p>

<p>and mace before him. Choristers singing. Music.</p>

<p>Enter Mayor of London, bearing the mace. Then</p>

<p>Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his head he wore a</p>

<p>gilt copper crown.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>A royal train, believe me! These I know.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Marques Dorset, bearing a scepter of gold; on his</p>

<p>head a demi-coronal of gold. With him, the Earl of</p>

<p>Surrey, bearing the rod of silver with the dove, crowned</p>

<p>with an earl’s coronet. Collars of S’s.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>Who’s that that bears the scepter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Marques Dorset,</p>

<p>And that the Earl of Surrey with the rod.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>A bold brave gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Duke of Suffolk, in his robe of estate, his</p>

<p>coronet on his head, bearing a long white wand, as High</p>

<p>Steward. With him, the Duke of Norfolk, with the rod of</p>

<p>Marshalship, a coronet on his head. Collars of S’s.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>That should be</p>

<p>The Duke of Suffolk.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  ’Tis the same: High Steward.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>And that my Lord of Norfolk?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a canopy, borne by four of the Cinque-ports,</p>

<p>under it the Queen in her robe, in her hair, richly</p>

<p>adorned with pearl, crowned. On each side her, the</p>

<p>Bishops of London and Winchester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Heaven bless thee!</p>

<p>Thou hast the sweetest face I ever looked on.–</p>

<p>Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel.</p>

<p>Our king has all the Indies in his arms,</p>

<p>And more, and richer, when he strains that lady.</p>

<p>I cannot blame his conscience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  They that bear</p>

<p>The cloth of honor over her are four barons</p>

<p>Of the Cinque-ports.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Those men are happy, and so are all are near her.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal of</p>

<p>gold wrought with flowers, bearing the Queen’s train.</p>

<p>Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain circlets of gold</p>

<p>without flowers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>I take it she that carries up the train</p>

<p>Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>It is, and all the rest are countesses.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>And sometimes falling ones.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  No more of that.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Coronation procession exits, having</p>

<p>passed over the stage in order and state, and then</p>

<p>a great flourish of trumpets.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a third Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>God save you, sir. Where have you been broiling?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Among the crowd i’ th’ Abbey, where a finger</p>

<p>Could not be wedged in more. I am stifled</p>

<p>With the mere rankness of their joy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  You saw</p>

<p>The ceremony?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  That I did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  How was it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Well worth the seeing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Good sir, speak it to us!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>As well as I am able. The rich stream</p>

<p>Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen</p>

<p>To a prepared place in the choir, fell off</p>

<p>A distance from her, while her Grace sat down</p>

<p>To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,</p>

<p>In a rich chair of state, opposing freely</p>

<p>The beauty of her person to the people.</p>

<p>Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman</p>

<p>That ever lay by man, which when the people</p>

<p>Had the full view of, such a noise arose</p>

<p>As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest–</p>

<p>As loud and to as many tunes. Hats, cloaks,</p>

<p>Doublets, I think, flew up, and had their faces</p>

<p>Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy</p>

<p>I never saw before. Great-bellied women</p>

<p>That had not half a week to go, like rams</p>

<p>In the old time of war, would shake the press</p>

<p>And make ’em reel before ’em. No man living</p>

<p>Could say “This is my wife there,” all were woven</p>

<p>So strangely in one piece.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  But what followed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>At length her Grace rose, and with modest paces</p>

<p>Came to the altar, where she kneeled and saintlike</p>

<p>Cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly,</p>

<p>Then rose again and bowed her to the people.</p>

<p>When by the Archbishop of Canterbury</p>

<p>She had all the royal makings of a queen–</p>

<p>As, holy oil, Edward Confessor’s crown,</p>

<p>The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems–</p>

<p>Laid nobly on her; which performed, the choir,</p>

<p>With all the choicest music of the kingdom,</p>

<p>Together sung Te Deum. So she parted,</p>

<p>And with the same full state paced back again</p>

<p>To York Place, where the feast is held.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Sir,</p>

<p>You must no more call it “York Place”; that’s past,</p>

<p>For since the Cardinal fell, that title’s lost.</p>

<p>’Tis now the King’s and called “Whitehall.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  I know it,</p>

<p>But ’tis so lately altered that the old name</p>

<p>Is fresh about me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  What two reverend bishops</p>

<p>Were those that went on each side of the Queen?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Stokeley and Gardiner, the one of Winchester,</p>

<p>Newly preferred from the King’s secretary,</p>

<p>The other London.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  He of Winchester</p>

<p>Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop’s,</p>

<p>The virtuous Cranmer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  All the land knows that.</p>

<p>However, yet there is no great breach. When it comes,</p>

<p>Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Who may that be, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Thomas Cromwell,</p>

<p>A man in much esteem with th’ King, and truly</p>

<p>A worthy friend. The King has made him</p>

<p>Master o’ th’ Jewel House,</p>

<p>And one already of the Privy Council.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>He will deserve more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Yes, without all doubt.</p>

<p>Come, gentlemen, you shall go my way,</p>

<p>Which is to th’ court, and there you shall be my</p>

<p>guests,</p>

<p>Something I can command. As I walk thither,</p>

<p>I’ll tell you more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>  You may command us, sir.</p>
