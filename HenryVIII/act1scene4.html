<p><center><i>[Hautboys. A small table under a state for the Cardinal, a</p>

<p>longer table for the guests. Then enter Anne Bullen and</p>

<p>divers other ladies and gentlemen as guests at one door;</p>

<p>at another door enter Sir Henry Guilford.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guilford</sc></p>

<p>Ladies, a general welcome from his Grace</p>

<p>Salutes you all. This night he dedicates</p>

<p>To fair content and you. None here, he hopes,</p>

<p>In all this noble bevy has brought with her</p>

<p>One care abroad. He would have all as merry</p>

<p>As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome</p>

<p>Can make good people.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Chamberlain, Lord Sands, and</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Lovell.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O, my lord, you’re tardy!</p>

<p>The very thought of this fair company</p>

<p>Clapped wings to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  You are young, Sir Harry Guilford.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sands</sc></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Lovell, had the Cardinal</p>

<p>But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these</p>

<p>Should find a running banquet, ere they rested,</p>

<p>I think would better please ’em. By my life,</p>

<p>They are a sweet society of fair ones.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lovell</sc></p>

<p>O, that your Lordship were but now confessor</p>

<p>To one or two of these!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sands</sc>  I would I were.</p>

<p>They should find easy penance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lovell</sc>  Faith, how easy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sands</sc></p>

<p>As easy as a down bed would afford it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc></p>

<p>Sweet ladies, will it please you sit?–Sir Harry,</p>

<p>Place you that side; I’ll take the charge of this.</p>

<p><center><i>[The guests are seated.]</i></center></p>

<p>His Grace is ent’ring. Nay, you must not freeze;</p>

<p>Two women placed together makes cold weather.</p>

<p>My Lord Sands, you are one will keep ’em waking.</p>

<p>Pray sit between these ladies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sands</sc>  By my faith,</p>

<p>And thank your Lordship.–By your leave, sweet ladies.</p>

<p><center><i>[He sits between Anne Bullen and another lady.]</i></center></p>

<p>If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;</p>

<p>I had it from my father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc>  Was he mad, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sands</sc></p>

<p>O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too;</p>

<p>But he would bite none. Just as I do now,</p>

<p>He would kiss you twenty with a breath.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kisses Anne.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  Well said,</p>

<p>my lord.</p>

<p>So, now you’re fairly seated, gentlemen,</p>

<p>The penance lies on you if these fair ladies</p>

<p>Pass away frowning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sands</sc>  For my little cure,</p>

<p>Let me alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Hautboys. Enter Cardinal Wolsey, with Attendants and</p>

<p>Servants, and takes his state.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>You’re welcome, my fair guests. That noble lady</p>

<p>Or gentleman that is not freely merry</p>

<p>Is not my friend. This to confirm my welcome,</p>

<p>And to you all good health.     <i><i>[He drinks to them.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sands</sc>  Your Grace is noble.</p>

<p>Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks</p>

<p>And save me so much talking.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  My Lord Sands,</p>

<p>I am beholding to you. Cheer your neighbors.–</p>

<p>Ladies, you are not merry.–Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Whose fault is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sands</sc>  The red wine first must rise</p>

<p>In their fair cheeks, my lord. Then we shall have ’em</p>

<p>Talk us to silence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc>  You are a merry gamester,</p>

<p>My Lord Sands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sands</sc>  Yes, if I make my play.</p>

<p>Here’s to your Ladyship, and pledge it, madam,</p>

<p><center><i>[He drinks to her.]</i></center></p>

<p>For ’tis to such a thing–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Anne</sc>  You cannot show me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sands</sc></p>

<p>I told your Grace they would talk anon.</p>

<p><center><i>[Drum and Trumpet. Chambers discharged.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  What’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc></p>

<p>Look out there, some of you.     <i><i>[Servants exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  What warlike voice,</p>

<p>And to what end, is this?–Nay, ladies, fear not.</p>

<p>By all the laws of war you’re privileged.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc></p>

<p>How now, what is ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  A noble troop of strangers,</p>

<p>For so they seem. They’ve left their barge and landed,</p>

<p>And hither make, as great ambassadors</p>

<p>From foreign princes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Good Lord Chamberlain,</p>

<p>Go, give ’em welcome–you can speak the French</p>

<p>tongue–</p>

<p>And pray receive ’em nobly, and conduct ’em</p>

<p>Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty</p>

<p>Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lord Chamberlain exits, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[All rise, and tables removed.]</i></center></p>

<p>You have now a broken banquet, but we’ll mend it.</p>

<p>A good digestion to you all; and once more</p>

<p>I shower a welcome on you. Welcome all!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Hautboys. Enter King and others as masquers, habited</p>

<p>like shepherds, ushered by the Lord Chamberlain.</p>

<p>They pass directly before the Cardinal and gracefully</p>

<p>salute him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>A noble company! What are their pleasures?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc></p>

<p>Because they speak no English, thus they prayed</p>

<p>To tell your Grace: that, having heard by fame</p>

<p>Of this so noble and so fair assembly</p>

<p>This night to meet here, they could do no less,</p>

<p>Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,</p>

<p>But leave their flocks and, under your fair conduct,</p>

<p>Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat</p>

<p>An hour of revels with ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Say, Lord Chamberlain,</p>

<p>They have done my poor house grace, for which I</p>

<p>pay ’em</p>

<p>A thousand thanks and pray ’em take their pleasures.</p>

<p><center><i>[The masquers choose Ladies. The</p>

<p>King chooses Anne Bullen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>The fairest hand I ever touched! O beauty,</p>

<p>Till now I never knew thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[Music, Dance.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>My lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  Your Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Pray tell ’em thus much</p>

<p>from me:</p>

<p>There should be one amongst ’em by his person</p>

<p>More worthy this place than myself, to whom,</p>

<p>If I but knew him, with my love and duty</p>

<p>I would surrender it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  I will, my lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[Whisper with the masquers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>What say they?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc>  Such a one they all confess</p>

<p>There is indeed, which they would have your Grace</p>

<p>Find out, and he will take it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Let me see, then.</p>

<p><center><i>[He leaves his state.]</i></center></p>

<p>By all your good leaves, gentlemen.</p>

<p><center><i>[He bows before the King.]</i></center></p>

<p>Here I’ll make</p>

<p>My royal choice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[unmasking]</i>  You have found him, cardinal.</p>

<p>You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord.</p>

<p>You are a churchman, or I’ll tell you, cardinal,</p>

<p>I should judge now unhappily.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  I am glad</p>

<p>Your Grace is grown so pleasant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  My Lord Chamberlain,</p>

<p>Prithee come hither. What fair lady’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chamberlain</sc></p>

<p>An ’t please your Grace, Sir Thomas Bullen’s daughter,</p>

<p>The Viscount Rochford, one of her Highness’ women.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>By heaven, she is a dainty one.–Sweetheart,</p>

<p>I were unmannerly to take you out</p>

<p>And not to kiss you. <i>[He kisses Anne.]</i> A health,</p>

<p>gentlemen!</p>

<p>Let it go round.     <i><i>[He drinks a toast.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready</p>

<p>I’ th’ privy chamber?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lovell</sc>  Yes, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  Your Grace,</p>

<p>I fear, with dancing is a little heated.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>I fear, too much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wolsey</sc>  There’s fresher air, my lord,</p>

<p>In the next chamber.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Lead in your ladies ev’ry one.–Sweet partner,</p>

<p>I must not yet forsake you.–Let’s be merry,</p>

<p>Good my Lord Cardinal. I have half a dozen healths</p>

<p>To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure</p>

<p>To lead ’em once again, and then let’s dream</p>

<p>Who’s best in favor. Let the music knock it.</p>
