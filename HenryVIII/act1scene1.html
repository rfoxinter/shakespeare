<p><center><i>[Enter the Duke of Norfolk at one door; at the other, the</p>

<p>Duke of Buckingham and the Lord Abergavenny.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, and well met. How have you done</p>

<p>Since last we saw in France?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  I thank your Grace,</p>

<p>Healthful, and ever since a fresh admirer</p>

<p>Of what I saw there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  An untimely ague</p>

<p>Stayed me a prisoner in my chamber when</p>

<p>Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,</p>

<p>Met in the vale of Andren.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  ’Twixt Guynes and Arde.</p>

<p>I was then present, saw them salute on horseback,</p>

<p>Beheld them when they lighted, how they clung</p>

<p>In their embracement, as they grew together–</p>

<p>Which had they, what four throned ones could have</p>

<p>weighed</p>

<p>Such a compounded one?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  All the whole time</p>

<p>I was my chamber’s prisoner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Then you lost</p>

<p>The view of earthly glory. Men might say</p>

<p>Till this time pomp was single, but now married</p>

<p>To one above itself. Each following day</p>

<p>Became the next day’s master, till the last</p>

<p>Made former wonders its. Today the French,</p>

<p>All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,</p>

<p>Shone down the English, and tomorrow they</p>

<p>Made Britain India: every man that stood</p>

<p>Showed like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</p>

<p>As cherubins, all gilt. The madams too,</p>

<p>Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear</p>

<p>The pride upon them, that their very labor</p>

<p>Was to them as a painting. Now this masque</p>

<p>Was cried incomparable; and th’ ensuing night</p>

<p>Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,</p>

<p>Equal in luster, were now best, now worst,</p>

<p>As presence did present them: him in eye</p>

<p>Still him in praise; and being present both,</p>

<p>’Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner</p>

<p>Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns–</p>

<p>For so they phrase ’em–by their heralds challenged</p>

<p>The noble spirits to arms, they did perform</p>

<p>Beyond thought’s compass, that former fabulous story,</p>

<p>Being now seen possible enough, got credit</p>

<p>That Bevis was believed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  O, you go far.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span></p>

<p>As I belong to worship, and affect</p>

<p>In honor honesty, the tract of everything</p>

<p>Would by a good discourser lose some life</p>

<p>Which action’s self was tongue to. All was royal;</p>

<p>To the disposing of it naught rebelled.</p>

<p>Order gave each thing view. The office did</p>

<p>Distinctly his full function.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  Who did guide,</p>

<p>I mean who set the body and the limbs</p>

<p>Of this great sport together, as you guess?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span></p>

<p>One, certes, that promises no element</p>

<p>In such a business.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  I pray you who, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span></p>

<p>All this was ordered by the good discretion</p>

<p>Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>The devil speed him! No man’s pie is freed</p>

<p>From his ambitious finger. What had he</p>

<p>To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder</p>

<p>That such a keech can with his very bulk</p>

<p>Take up the rays o’ th’ beneficial sun</p>

<p>And keep it from the Earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Surely, sir,</p>

<p>There’s in him stuff that puts him to these ends;</p>

<p>For, being not propped by ancestry, whose grace</p>

<p>Chalks successors their way, nor called upon</p>

<p>For high feats done to th’ crown, neither allied</p>

<p>To eminent assistants, but spiderlike,</p>

<p>Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note</p>

<p>The force of his own merit makes his way–</p>

<p>A gift that heaven gives for him which buys</p>

<p>A place next to the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Abergavenny</span>  I cannot tell</p>

<p>What heaven hath given him–let some graver eye</p>

<p>Pierce into that–but I can see his pride</p>

<p>Peep through each part of him. Whence has he that?</p>

<p>If not from hell, the devil is a niggard,</p>

<p>Or has given all before, and he begins</p>

<p>A new hell in himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  Why the devil,</p>

<p>Upon this French going-out, took he upon him,</p>

<p>Without the privity o’ th’ King, t’ appoint</p>

<p>Who should attend on him? He makes up the file</p>

<p>Of all the gentry, for the most part such</p>

<p>To whom as great a charge as little honor</p>

<p>He meant to lay upon; and his own letter,</p>

<p>The honorable board of council out,</p>

<p>Must fetch him in he papers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Abergavenny</span>  I do know</p>

<p>Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have</p>

<p>By this so sickened their estates that never</p>

<p>They shall abound as formerly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  O, many</p>

<p>Have broke their backs with laying manors on ’em</p>

<p>For this great journey. What did this vanity</p>

<p>But minister communication of</p>

<p>A most poor issue?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Grievingly I think</p>

<p>The peace between the French and us not values</p>

<p>The cost that did conclude it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  Every man,</p>

<p>After the hideous storm that followed, was</p>

<p>A thing inspired and, not consulting, broke</p>

<p>Into a general prophecy: that this tempest,</p>

<p>Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded</p>

<p>The sudden breach on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Which is budded out,</p>

<p>For France hath flawed the league and hath attached</p>

<p>Our merchants’ goods at Bordeaux.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Abergavenny</span>  Is it therefore</p>

<p>Th’ ambassador is silenced?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Marry, is ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Abergavenny</span></p>

<p>A proper title of a peace, and purchased</p>

<p>At a superfluous rate!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  Why, all this business</p>

<p>Our reverend cardinal carried.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Like it your Grace,</p>

<p>The state takes notice of the private difference</p>

<p>Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you–</p>

<p>And take it from a heart that wishes towards you</p>

<p>Honor and plenteous safety–that you read</p>

<p>The Cardinal’s malice and his potency</p>

<p>Together; to consider further that</p>

<p>What his high hatred would effect wants not</p>

<p>A minister in his power. You know his nature,</p>

<p>That he’s revengeful, and I know his sword</p>

<p>Hath a sharp edge; it’s long, and ’t may be said</p>

<p>It reaches far, and where ’twill not extend,</p>

<p>Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel;</p>

<p>You’ll find it wholesome. Lo where comes that rock</p>

<p>That I advise your shunning.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cardinal Wolsey, the purse borne before him,</p>

<p>certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with papers.</p>

<p>The Cardinal in his passage fixeth his eye on Buckingham,</p>

<p>and Buckingham on him, both full of disdain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span> <i>[aside to a Secretary]</i></p>

<p>The Duke of Buckingham’s surveyor, ha?</p>

<p>Where’s his examination?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Secretary</span>  Here, so please you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands Wolsey a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span></p>

<p>Is he in person ready?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Secretary</span>  Ay, please your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wolsey</span></p>

<p>Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham</p>

<p>Shall lessen this big look.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cardinal Wolsey and his train exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>This butcher’s cur is venomed-mouthed, and I</p>

<p>Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best</p>

<p>Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar’s book</p>

<p>Outworths a noble’s blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  What, are you chafed?</p>

<p>Ask God for temp’rance. That’s th’ appliance only</p>

<p>Which your disease requires.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  I read in ’s looks</p>

<p>Matter against me, and his eye reviled</p>

<p>Me as his abject object. At this instant</p>

<p>He bores me with some trick. He’s gone to th’ King.</p>

<p>I’ll follow and outstare him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Stay, my lord,</p>

<p>And let your reason with your choler question</p>

<p>What ’tis you go about. To climb steep hills</p>

<p>Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like</p>

<p>A full hot horse who, being allowed his way,</p>

<p>Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England</p>

<p>Can advise me like you; be to yourself</p>

<p>As you would to your friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  I’ll to the King,</p>

<p>And from a mouth of honor quite cry down</p>

<p>This Ipswich fellow’s insolence, or proclaim</p>

<p>There’s difference in no persons.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Be advised.</p>

<p>Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot</p>

<p>That it do singe yourself. We may outrun</p>

<p>By violent swiftness that which we run at</p>

<p>And lose by overrunning. Know you not</p>

<p>The fire that mounts the liquor till ’t run o’er</p>

<p>In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised.</p>

<p>I say again there is no English soul</p>

<p>More stronger to direct you than yourself,</p>

<p>If with the sap of reason you would quench</p>

<p>Or but allay the fire of passion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  Sir,</p>

<p>I am thankful to you, and I’ll go along</p>

<p>By your prescription. But this top-proud fellow–</p>

<p>Whom from the flow of gall I name not, but</p>

<p>From sincere motions–by intelligence,</p>

<p>And proofs as clear as founts in July when</p>

<p>We see each grain of gravel, I do know</p>

<p>To be corrupt and treasonous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Say not “treasonous.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>To th’ King I’ll say ’t, and make my vouch as strong</p>

<p>As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,</p>

<p>Or wolf, or both–for he is equal rav’nous</p>

<p>As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief</p>

<p>As able to perform ’t, his mind and place</p>

<p>Infecting one another, yea reciprocally–</p>

<p>Only to show his pomp as well in France</p>

<p>As here at home, suggests the King our master</p>

<p>To this last costly treaty, th’ interview</p>

<p>That swallowed so much treasure and like a glass</p>

<p>Did break i’ th’ rinsing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Faith, and so it did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>Pray give me favor, sir. This cunning cardinal</p>

<p>The articles o’ th’ combination drew</p>

<p>As himself pleased; and they were ratified</p>

<p>As he cried “Thus let be,” to as much end</p>

<p>As give a crutch to th’ dead. But our Count Cardinal</p>

<p>Has done this, and ’tis well, for worthy Wolsey,</p>

<p>Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows–</p>

<p>Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy</p>

<p>To th’ old dam treason: Charles the Emperor,</p>

<p>Under pretense to see the Queen his aunt–</p>

<p>For ’twas indeed his color, but he came</p>

<p>To whisper Wolsey–here makes visitation;</p>

<p>His fears were that the interview betwixt</p>

<p>England and France might through their amity</p>

<p>Breed him some prejudice, for from this league</p>

<p>Peeped harms that menaced him; privily</p>

<p>Deals with our cardinal and, as I trow–</p>

<p>Which I do well, for I am sure the Emperor</p>

<p>Paid ere he promised, whereby his suit was granted</p>

<p>Ere it was asked. But when the way was made</p>

<p>And paved with gold, the Emperor thus desired</p>

<p>That he would please to alter the King’s course</p>

<p>And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know–</p>

<p>As soon he shall by me–that thus the Cardinal</p>

<p>Does buy and sell his honor as he pleases</p>

<p>And for his own advantage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  I am sorry</p>

<p>To hear this of him, and could wish he were</p>

<p>Something mistaken in ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  No, not a syllable.</p>

<p>I do pronounce him in that very shape</p>

<p>He shall appear in proof.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Brandon, a Sergeant-at-Arms before him, and two</p>

<p>or three of the Guard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brandon</span></p>

<p>Your office, Sergeant: execute it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sergeant</span> <i>[to Buckingham]</i>  Sir,</p>

<p>My lord the Duke of Buckingham and Earl</p>

<p>Of Hertford, Stafford, and Northampton, I</p>

<p>Arrest thee of high treason, in the name</p>

<p>Of our most sovereign king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span> <i>[to Norfolk]</i>  Lo you, my lord,</p>

<p>The net has fall’n upon me. I shall perish</p>

<p>Under device and practice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brandon</span>  I am sorry</p>

<p>To see you ta’en from liberty, to look on</p>

<p>The business present. ’Tis his Highness’ pleasure</p>

<p>You shall to th’ Tower.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  It will help me nothing</p>

<p>To plead mine innocence, for that dye is on me</p>

<p>Which makes my whit’st part black. The will of heaven</p>

<p>Be done in this and all things. I obey.</p>

<p>O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brandon</span></p>

<p>Nay, he must bear you company.–The King</p>

<p>Is pleased you shall to th’ Tower, till you know</p>

<p>How he determines further.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Abergavenny</span>  As the Duke said,</p>

<p>The will of heaven be done, and the King’s pleasure</p>

<p>By me obeyed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brandon</span>  Here is a warrant from</p>

<p>The King t’ attach Lord Mountacute, and the bodies</p>

<p>Of the Duke’s confessor, John de la Car,</p>

<p>One Gilbert Peck, his counselor–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  So, so;</p>

<p>These are the limbs o’ th’ plot. No more, I hope.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>  O, Michael Hopkins?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brandon</span>  He.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>My surveyor is false. The o’ergreat cardinal</p>

<p>Hath showed him gold. My life is spanned already.</p>

<p>I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,</p>

<p>Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on</p>

<p>By dark’ning my clear sun. <i>[To Norfolk.]</i> My lord,</p>
