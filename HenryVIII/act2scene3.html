<p><center><i>[Enter Anne Bullen and an old Lady.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Not for that neither. Here’s the pang that pinches:</p>

<p>His Highness having lived so long with her, and she</p>

<p>So good a lady that no tongue could ever</p>

<p>Pronounce dishonor of her–by my life,</p>

<p>She never knew harm-doing!–O, now, after</p>

<p>So many courses of the sun enthroned,</p>

<p>Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which</p>

<p>To leave a thousandfold more bitter than</p>

<p>’Tis sweet at first t’ acquire–after this process,</p>

<p>To give her the avaunt! It is a pity</p>

<p>Would move a monster.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span>  Hearts of most hard temper</p>

<p>Melt and lament for her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  O, God’s will! Much better</p>

<p>She ne’er had known pomp; though ’t be temporal,</p>

<p>Yet if that quarrel, Fortune, do divorce</p>

<p>It from the bearer, ’tis a sufferance panging</p>

<p>As soul and body’s severing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span>  Alas, poor lady,</p>

<p>She’s a stranger now again!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  So much the more</p>

<p>Must pity drop upon her. Verily,</p>

<p>I swear, ’tis better to be lowly born</p>

<p>And range with humble livers in content</p>

<p>Than to be perked up in a glist’ring grief</p>

<p>And wear a golden sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span>  Our content</p>

<p>Is our best having.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  By my troth and maidenhead,</p>

<p>I would not be a queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span>  Beshrew me, I would,</p>

<p>And venture maidenhead for ’t; and so would you,</p>

<p>For all this spice of your hypocrisy.</p>

<p>You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,</p>

<p>Have too a woman’s heart, which ever yet</p>

<p>Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;</p>

<p>Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,</p>

<p>Saving your mincing, the capacity</p>

<p>Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive</p>

<p>If you might please to stretch it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  Nay, good troth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span></p>

<p>Yes, troth, and troth. You would not be a queen?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>No, not for all the riches under heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span></p>

<p>’Tis strange. A threepence bowed would hire me,</p>

<p>Old as I am, to queen it. But I pray you,</p>

<p>What think you of a duchess? Have you limbs</p>

<p>To bear that load of title?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  No, in truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span></p>

<p>Then you are weakly made. Pluck off a little.</p>

<p>I would not be a young count in your way</p>

<p>For more than blushing comes to. If your back</p>

<p>Cannot vouchsafe this burden, ’tis too weak</p>

<p>Ever to get a boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  How you do talk!</p>

<p>I swear again, I would not be a queen</p>

<p>For all the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span>  In faith, for little England</p>

<p>You’d venture an emballing. I myself</p>

<p>Would for Carnarvanshire, although there longed</p>

<p>No more to th’ crown but that. Lo, who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Chamberlain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, ladies. What were ’t worth to know</p>

<p>The secret of your conference?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  My good lord,</p>

<p>Not your demand; it values not your asking.</p>

<p>Our mistress’ sorrows we were pitying.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span></p>

<p>It was a gentle business, and becoming</p>

<p>The action of good women. There is hope</p>

<p>All will be well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  Now, I pray God, amen!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span></p>

<p>You bear a gentle mind, and heav’nly blessings</p>

<p>Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,</p>

<p>Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note’s</p>

<p>Ta’en of your many virtues, the King’s Majesty</p>

<p>Commends his good opinion of you to you, and</p>

<p>Does purpose honor to you no less flowing</p>

<p>Than Marchioness of Pembroke, to which title</p>

<p>A thousand pound a year annual support</p>

<p>Out of his grace he adds.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  I do not know</p>

<p>What kind of my obedience I should tender.</p>

<p>More than my all is nothing, nor my prayers</p>

<p>Are not words duly hallowed, nor my wishes</p>

<p>More worth than empty vanities. Yet prayers and</p>

<p>wishes</p>

<p>Are all I can return. ’Beseech your Lordship,</p>

<p>Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,</p>

<p>As from a blushing handmaid, to his Highness,</p>

<p>Whose health and royalty I pray for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  Lady,</p>

<p>I shall not fail t’ approve the fair conceit</p>

<p>The King hath of you. <i>[(Aside.)]</i> I have perused her</p>

<p>well.</p>

<p>Beauty and honor in her are so mingled</p>

<p>That they have caught the King. And who knows yet</p>

<p>But from this lady may proceed a gem</p>

<p>To lighten all this isle?–I’ll to the King</p>

<p>And say I spoke with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  My honored lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lord Chamberlain exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span>  Why, this it is! See, see!</p>

<p>I have been begging sixteen years in court,</p>

<p>Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could</p>

<p>Come pat betwixt too early and too late</p>

<p>For any suit of pounds; and you–O, fate!–</p>

<p>A very fresh fish here–fie, fie, fie upon</p>

<p>This compelled fortune!–have your mouth filled up</p>

<p>Before you open it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  This is strange to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span></p>

<p>How tastes it? Is it bitter? Forty pence, no.</p>

<p>There was a lady once–’tis an old story–</p>

<p>That would not be a queen, that would she not,</p>

<p>For all the mud in Egypt. Have you heard it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span></p>

<p>Come, you are pleasant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span>  With your theme, I could</p>

<p>O’ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke?</p>

<p>A thousand pounds a year for pure respect?</p>

<p>No other obligation? By my life,</p>

<p>That promises more thousands; honor’s train</p>

<p>Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time</p>

<p>I know your back will bear a duchess. Say,</p>

<p>Are you not stronger than you were?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Anne</span>  Good lady,</p>

<p>Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,</p>

<p>And leave me out on ’t. Would I had no being</p>

<p>If this salute my blood a jot. It faints me</p>

<p>To think what follows.</p>

<p>The Queen is comfortless and we forgetful</p>

<p>In our long absence. Pray do not deliver</p>

<p>What here you’ve heard to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Old</span> <span class='sc'>Lady</span>  What do you think me?</p>
