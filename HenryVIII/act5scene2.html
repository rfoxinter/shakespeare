<p><center><i>[Enter Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury. (Pages,</p>

<p>Footboys, Grooms, and other servants attend at the</p>

<p>Council door.)]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span></p>

<p>I hope I am not too late, and yet the gentleman</p>

<p>That was sent to me from the Council prayed me</p>

<p>To make great haste.     <i><i>[He tries the door.]</i></i></p>

<p>All fast? What means this? Ho!</p>

<p>Who waits there?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Keeper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Sure you know me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span>  Yes, my lord,</p>

<p>But yet I cannot help you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span>  Why?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span></p>

<p>Your Grace must wait till you be called for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span>  So.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Doctor Butts.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Butts</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>This is a piece of malice. I am glad</p>

<p>I came this way so happily. The King</p>

<p>Shall understand it presently.     <i><i>[Butts exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span> <i>[aside]</i>  ’Tis Butts,</p>

<p>The King’s physician. As he passed along</p>

<p>How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!</p>

<p>Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace. For certain</p>

<p>This is of purpose laid by some that hate me–</p>

<p>God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice–</p>

<p>To quench mine honor. They would shame to make me</p>

<p>Wait else at door, a fellow councillor,</p>

<p>’Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures</p>

<p>Must be fulfilled, and I attend with patience.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the King and Butts at a window above.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Butts</span></p>

<p>I’ll show your Grace the strangest sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  What’s that,</p>

<p>Butts?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Butts</span></p>

<p>I think your Highness saw this many a day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Body o’ me, where is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Butts</span>  There, my lord:</p>

<p>The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury,</p>

<p>Who holds his state at door, ’mongst pursuivants,</p>

<p>Pages, and footboys.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Ha! ’Tis he indeed.</p>

<p>Is this the honor they do one another?</p>

<p>’Tis well there’s one above ’em yet. I had thought</p>

<p>They had parted so much honesty among ’em–</p>

<p>At least good manners–as not thus to suffer</p>

<p>A man of his place, and so near our favor,</p>

<p>To dance attendance on their Lordships’ pleasures,</p>

<p>And at the door, too, like a post with packets.</p>

<p>By holy Mary, Butts, there’s knavery!</p>

<p>Let ’em alone, and draw the curtain close.</p>

<p>We shall hear more anon.     <i><i>[They draw the curtain.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[A council table brought in with chairs and stools and</p>

<p>placed under the state. Enter Lord Chancellor, places</p>

<p>himself at the upper end of the table on the left hand, a</p>

<p>seat being left void above him, as for Canterbury’s seat.</p>

<p>Duke of Suffolk, Duke of Norfolk, Surrey, Lord</p>

<p>Chamberlain, Gardiner seat themselves in order on each</p>

<p>side, Cromwell at lower end as secretary.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chancellor</span></p>

<p>Speak to the business, Master Secretary.</p>

<p>Why are we met in council?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>  Please your honors,</p>

<p>The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span></p>

<p>Has he had knowledge of it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span> <i>[to Keeper]</i>  Who waits there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span></p>

<p>Without, my noble lords?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span>  My lord Archbishop,</p>

<p>And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chancellor</span></p>

<p>Let him come in.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span> <i>[at door]</i>  Your Grace may enter now.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cranmer approaches the council table.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chancellor</span></p>

<p>My good lord Archbishop, I’m very sorry</p>

<p>To sit here at this present and behold</p>

<p>That chair stand empty. But we all are men,</p>

<p>In our own natures frail, and capable</p>

<p>Of our flesh–few are angels–out of which frailty</p>

<p>And want of wisdom you, that best should teach us,</p>

<p>Have misdemeaned yourself, and not a little,</p>

<p>Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling</p>

<p>The whole realm, by your teaching and your</p>

<p>chaplains’–</p>

<p>For so we are informed–with new opinions,</p>

<p>Divers and dangerous, which are heresies</p>

<p>And, not reformed, may prove pernicious.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span></p>

<p>Which reformation must be sudden too,</p>

<p>My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses</p>

<p>Pace ’em not in their hands to make ’em gentle,</p>

<p>But stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur ’em</p>

<p>Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,</p>

<p>Out of our easiness and childish pity</p>

<p>To one man’s honor, this contagious sickness,</p>

<p>Farewell, all physic. And what follows then?</p>

<p>Commotions, uproars, with a general taint</p>

<p>Of the whole state, as of late days our neighbors,</p>

<p>The upper Germany, can dearly witness,</p>

<p>Yet freshly pitied in our memories.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span></p>

<p>My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress</p>

<p>Both of my life and office, I have labored,</p>

<p>And with no little study, that my teaching</p>

<p>And the strong course of my authority</p>

<p>Might go one way and safely; and the end</p>

<p>Was ever to do well. Nor is there living–</p>

<p>I speak it with a single heart, my lords–</p>

<p>A man that more detests, more stirs against,</p>

<p>Both in his private conscience and his place,</p>

<p>Defacers of a public peace than I do.</p>

<p>Pray heaven the King may never find a heart</p>

<p>With less allegiance in it! Men that make</p>

<p>Envy and crooked malice nourishment</p>

<p>Dare bite the best. I do beseech your Lordships</p>

<p>That, in this case of justice, my accusers,</p>

<p>Be what they will, may stand forth face to face</p>

<p>And freely urge against me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  Nay, my lord,</p>

<p>That cannot be. You are a councillor,</p>

<p>And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span></p>

<p>My lord, because we have business of more moment,</p>

<p>We will be short with you. ’Tis his Highness’ pleasure,</p>

<p>And our consent, for better trial of you</p>

<p>From hence you be committed to the Tower,</p>

<p>Where, being but a private man again,</p>

<p>You shall know many dare accuse you boldly–</p>

<p>More than, I fear, you are provided for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span></p>

<p>Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you.</p>

<p>You are always my good friend. If your will pass,</p>

<p>I shall both find your Lordship judge and juror,</p>

<p>You are so merciful. I see your end:</p>

<p>’Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,</p>

<p>Become a churchman better than ambition.</p>

<p>Win straying souls with modesty again;</p>

<p>Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,</p>

<p>Lay all the weight you can upon my patience,</p>

<p>I make as little doubt as you do conscience</p>

<p>In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,</p>

<p>But reverence to your calling makes me modest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span></p>

<p>My lord, my lord, you are a sectary.</p>

<p>That’s the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers,</p>

<p>To men that understand you, words and weakness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cromwell</span></p>

<p>My Lord of Winchester, you’re a little,</p>

<p>By your good favor, too sharp. Men so noble,</p>

<p>However faulty, yet should find respect</p>

<p>For what they have been. ’Tis a cruelty</p>

<p>To load a falling man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span>  Good Master Secretary–</p>

<p>I cry your Honor mercy–you may worst</p>

<p>Of all this table say so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>  Why, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span></p>

<p>Do not I know you for a favorer</p>

<p>Of this new sect? You are not sound.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>  Not sound?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span></p>

<p>Not sound, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>  Would you were half so honest!</p>

<p>Men’s prayers then would seek you, not their fears.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span></p>

<p>I shall remember this bold language.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>  Do.</p>

<p>Remember your bold life too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chancellor</span>  This is too much!</p>

<p>Forbear, for shame, my lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span>  I have done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>  And I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chancellor</span> <i>[to Cranmer]</i></p>

<p>Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,</p>

<p>I take it, by all voices, that forthwith</p>

<p>You be conveyed to th’ Tower a prisoner,</p>

<p>There to remain till the King’s further pleasure</p>

<p>Be known unto us.–Are you all agreed, lords?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span></p>

<p>We are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span>  Is there no other way of mercy</p>

<p>But I must needs to th’ Tower, my lords?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span>  What other</p>

<p>Would you expect? You are strangely troublesome.</p>

<p>Let some o’ th’ guard be ready there.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Guard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span>  For me?</p>

<p>Must I go like a traitor thither?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span>  Receive him,</p>

<p>And see him safe i’ th’ Tower.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span>  Stay, good my lords,</p>

<p>I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords.</p>

<p><center><i>[He holds out the ring.]</i></center></p>

<p>By virtue of that ring, I take my cause</p>

<p>Out of the grips of cruel men and give it</p>

<p>To a most noble judge, the King my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span></p>

<p>This is the King’s ring.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Surrey</span>  ’Tis no counterfeit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>’Tis the right ring, by heaven! I told you all,</p>

<p>When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,</p>

<p>’Twould fall upon ourselves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>  Do you think, my lords,</p>

<p>The King will suffer but the little finger</p>

<p>Of this man to be vexed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>  ’Tis now too certain.</p>

<p>How much more is his life in value with him!</p>

<p>Would I were fairly out on ’t!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>  My mind gave me,</p>

<p>In seeking tales and informations</p>

<p>Against this man, whose honesty the devil</p>

<p>And his disciples only envy at,</p>

<p>You blew the fire that burns you. Now, have at you!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King, frowning on them; takes his seat.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span></p>

<p>Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven</p>

<p>In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince,</p>

<p>Not only good and wise, but most religious;</p>

<p>One that in all obedience makes the Church</p>

<p>The chief aim of his honor, and to strengthen</p>

<p>That holy duty out of dear respect,</p>

<p>His royal self in judgment comes to hear</p>

<p>The cause betwixt her and this great offender.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>You were ever good at sudden commendations,</p>

<p>Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not</p>

<p>To hear such flattery now, and in my presence</p>

<p>They are too thin and base to hide offenses.</p>

<p>To me you cannot reach. You play the spaniel,</p>

<p>And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;</p>

<p>But whatsoe’er thou tak’st me for, I’m sure</p>

<p>Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.–</p>

<p>Good man, sit down.     <i><i>[Cranmer takes his seat.]</i></i></p>

<p>Now let me see the proudest</p>

<p>He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee.</p>

<p>By all that’s holy, he had better starve</p>

<p>Than but once think this place becomes thee not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Surrey</span></p>

<p>May it please your Grace–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  No, sir, it does not please</p>

<p>me.</p>

<p>I had thought I had had men of some understanding</p>

<p>And wisdom of my Council, but I find none.</p>

<p>Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,</p>

<p>This good man–few of you deserve that title–</p>

<p>This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy</p>

<p>At chamber door? And one as great as you are?</p>

<p>Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission</p>

<p>Bid you so far forget yourselves? I gave you</p>

<p>Power as he was a councillor to try him,</p>

<p>Not as a groom. There’s some of you, I see,</p>

<p>More out of malice than integrity,</p>

<p>Would try him to the utmost, had you mean,</p>

<p>Which you shall never have while I live.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chancellor</span>  Thus far,</p>

<p>My most dread sovereign, may it like your Grace</p>

<p>To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed</p>

<p>Concerning his imprisonment was rather,</p>

<p>If there be faith in men, meant for his trial</p>

<p>And fair purgation to the world than malice,</p>

<p>I’m sure, in me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Well, well, my lords, respect him.</p>

<p>Take him, and use him well; he’s worthy of it.</p>

<p>I will say thus much for him: if a prince</p>

<p>May be beholding to a subject, I</p>

<p>Am, for his love and service, so to him.</p>

<p>Make me no more ado, but all embrace him.</p>

<p>Be friends, for shame, my lords.</p>

<p><center><i>[They embrace Cranmer.]</i></center></p>

<p>My Lord of Canterbury,</p>

<p>I have a suit which you must not deny me:</p>

<p>That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism.</p>

<p>You must be godfather and answer for her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span></p>

<p>The greatest monarch now alive may glory</p>

<p>In such an honor. How may I deserve it,</p>

<p>That am a poor and humble subject to you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Come, come, my lord, you’d spare your spoons.</p>

<p>You shall have two noble partners with you: the</p>

<p>old Duchess of Norfolk and Lady Marquess Dorset.</p>

<p>Will these please you?–</p>

<p>Once more, my lord of Winchester, I charge you,</p>

<p>Embrace and love this man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gardiner</span>  With a true heart</p>

<p>And brother-love I do it.     <i><i>[He embraces Cranmer.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cranmer</span> <i>[weeping]</i>  And let heaven</p>

<p>Witness how dear I hold this confirmation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart.</p>

<p>The common voice, I see, is verified</p>

<p>Of thee, which says thus: “Do my Lord of Canterbury</p>

<p>A shrewd turn, and he’s your friend forever.”–</p>

<p>Come, lords, we trifle time away. I long</p>

<p>To have this young one made a Christian.</p>

<p>As I have made you one, lords, one remain.</p>

<p>So I grow stronger, you more honor gain.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
