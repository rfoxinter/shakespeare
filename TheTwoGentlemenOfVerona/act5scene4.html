<p><center><i>[Enter Valentine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc></p>

<p>How use doth breed a habit in a man!</p>

<p>This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,</p>

<p>I better brook than flourishing peopled towns;</p>

<p>Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,</p>

<p>And to the nightingale’s complaining notes</p>

<p>Tune my distresses and record my woes.</p>

<p>O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,</p>

<p>Leave not the mansion so long tenantless</p>

<p>Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall</p>

<p>And leave no memory of what it was.</p>

<p>Repair me with thy presence, Sylvia;</p>

<p>Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain.</p>

<p><center><i>[Shouting and sounds of fighting.]</i></center></p>

<p>What hallowing and what stir is this today?</p>

<p>These are my mates, that make their wills their law,</p>

<p>Have some unhappy passenger in chase.</p>

<p>They love me well, yet I have much to do</p>

<p>To keep them from uncivil outrages.</p>

<p>Withdraw thee, Valentine. Who’s this comes here?</p>

<p><center><i>[He steps aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Proteus, Sylvia, and Julia, disguised as</p>

<p>Sebastian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Madam, this service I have done for you–</p>

<p>Though you respect not aught your servant doth–</p>

<p>To hazard life, and rescue you from him</p>

<p>That would have forced your honor and your love.</p>

<p>Vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look;</p>

<p>A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,</p>

<p>And less than this I am sure you cannot give.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>How like a dream is this I see and hear!</p>

<p>Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>O miserable, unhappy that I am!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came,</p>

<p>But by my coming, I have made you happy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>By thy approach thou mak’st me most unhappy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>And me, when he approacheth to your presence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>Had I been seized by a hungry lion,</p>

<p>I would have been a breakfast to the beast</p>

<p>Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.</p>

<p>O heaven, be judge how I love Valentine,</p>

<p>Whose life’s as tender to me as my soul;</p>

<p>And full as much, for more there cannot be,</p>

<p>I do detest false perjured Proteus.</p>

<p>Therefore begone; solicit me no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>What dangerous action, stood it next to death,</p>

<p>Would I not undergo for one calm look!</p>

<p>O, ’tis the curse in love, and still approved,</p>

<p>When women cannot love where they’re beloved.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>When Proteus cannot love where he’s beloved.</p>

<p>Read over Julia’s heart, thy first best love,</p>

<p>For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith</p>

<p>Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths</p>

<p>Descended into perjury to love me.</p>

<p>Thou hast no faith left now unless thou ’dst two,</p>

<p>And that’s far worse than none; better have none</p>

<p>Than plural faith, which is too much by one.</p>

<p>Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  In love</p>

<p>Who respects friend?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc>  All men but Proteus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words</p>

<p>Can no way change you to a milder form,</p>

<p>I’ll woo you like a soldier, at arms’ end,</p>

<p>And love you ’gainst the nature of love–force you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He seizes her.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>O, heaven!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  I’ll force thee yield to my desire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc> <i>[advancing]</i></p>

<p>Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,</p>

<p>Thou friend of an ill fashion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  Valentine!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc></p>

<p>Thou common friend, that’s without faith or love,</p>

<p>For such is a friend now. Treacherous man,</p>

<p>Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye</p>

<p>Could have persuaded me. Now I dare not say</p>

<p>I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.</p>

<p>Who should be trusted when one’s right hand</p>

<p>Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,</p>

<p>I am sorry I must never trust thee more,</p>

<p>But count the world a stranger for thy sake.</p>

<p>The private wound is deepest. O, time most</p>

<p>accursed,</p>

<p>’Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  My shame and guilt confounds me.</p>

<p>Forgive me, Valentine. If hearty sorrow</p>

<p>Be a sufficient ransom for offense,</p>

<p>I tender ’t here. I do as truly suffer</p>

<p>As e’er I did commit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc>  Then I am paid,</p>

<p>And once again I do receive thee honest.</p>

<p>Who by repentance is not satisfied</p>

<p>Is nor of heaven nor Earth, for these are pleased;</p>

<p>By penitence th’ Eternal’s wrath’s appeased.</p>

<p>And that my love may appear plain and free,</p>

<p>All that was mine in Sylvia I give thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>O me unhappy!     <i><i>[She swoons.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  Look to the boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc>  Why, boy!</p>

<p>Why, wag, how now? What’s the matter? Look up.</p>

<p>Speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  O, good sir, my master charged</p>

<p>me to deliver a ring to Madam Sylvia, which out of</p>

<p>my neglect was never done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  Where is that ring, boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Here ’tis; this is it.</p>

<p><center><i>[She rises, and hands him a ring.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  How, let me see.</p>

<p>Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook.</p>

<p>This is the ring you sent to Sylvia.</p>

<p><center><i>[She offers another ring.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>But how cam’st thou by this ring? At my depart</p>

<p>I gave this unto Julia.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>And Julia herself did give it me,</p>

<p>And Julia herself hath brought it hither.</p>

<p><center><i>[She reveals herself.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  How? Julia!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths</p>

<p>And entertained ’em deeply in her heart.</p>

<p>How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!</p>

<p>O, Proteus, let this habit make thee blush.</p>

<p>Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me</p>

<p>Such an immodest raiment, if shame live</p>

<p>In a disguise of love.</p>

<p>It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,</p>

<p>Women to change their shapes than men their minds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>“Than men their minds”? ’Tis true. O heaven, were</p>

<p>man</p>

<p>But constant, he were perfect; that one error</p>

<p>Fills him with faults, makes him run through all th’</p>

<p>sins;</p>

<p>Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.</p>

<p>What is in Sylvia’s face but I may spy</p>

<p>More fresh in Julia’s, with a constant eye?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc> <i>[to Julia and Proteus]</i>  Come, come, a</p>

<p>hand from either.</p>

<p>Let me be blest to make this happy close.</p>

<p>’Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.</p>

<p><center><i>[Valentine joins the hands of Julia and Proteus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>And I mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Thurio, Duke, and Outlaws.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Outlaws</sc>  A prize, a prize, a prize!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc></p>

<p>Forbear, forbear, I say. It is my lord the Duke.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Outlaws release the Duke and Thurio.]</i></center></p>

<p>Your Grace is welcome to a man disgraced,</p>

<p>Banished Valentine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Sir Valentine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thurio</sc>  Yonder is Sylvia, and Sylvia’s mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc></p>

<p>Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;</p>

<p>Come not within the measure of my wrath.</p>

<p>Do not name Sylvia thine; if once again,</p>

<p>Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;</p>

<p>Take but possession of her with a touch–</p>

<p>I dare thee but to breathe upon my love!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thurio</sc></p>

<p>Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I.</p>

<p>I hold him but a fool that will endanger</p>

<p>His body for a girl that loves him not.</p>

<p>I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>The more degenerate and base art thou</p>

<p>To make such means for her as thou hast done,</p>

<p>And leave her on such slight conditions.–</p>

<p>Now, by the honor of my ancestry,</p>

<p>I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,</p>

<p>And think thee worthy of an empress’ love.</p>

<p>Know, then, I here forget all former griefs,</p>

<p>Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,</p>

<p>Plead a new state in thy unrivaled merit,</p>

<p>To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,</p>

<p>Thou art a gentleman, and well derived;</p>

<p>Take thou thy Sylvia, for thou hast deserved her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc></p>

<p>I thank your Grace, the gift hath made me happy.</p>

<p>I now beseech you, for your daughter’s sake,</p>

<p>To grant one boon that I shall ask of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>I grant it for thine own, whate’er it be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc></p>

<p>These banished men, that I have kept withal,</p>

<p>Are men endued with worthy qualities.</p>

<p>Forgive them what they have committed here,</p>

<p>And let them be recalled from their exile;</p>

<p>They are reformed, civil, full of good,</p>

<p>And fit for great employment, worthy lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Thou hast prevailed; I pardon them and thee.</p>

<p>Dispose of them as thou know’st their deserts.</p>

<p>Come, let us go; we will include all jars</p>

<p>With triumphs, mirth, and rare solemnity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc></p>

<p>And as we walk along, I dare be bold</p>

<p>With our discourse to make your Grace to smile.</p>

<p><i>[Pointing to Julia.]</i> What think you of this page, my</p>

<p>lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc></p>

<p>I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  What mean you by that saying?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valentine</sc></p>

<p>Please you, I’ll tell you as we pass along,</p>

<p>That you will wonder what hath fortuned.–</p>

<p>Come, Proteus, ’tis your penance but to hear</p>

<p>The story of your loves discovered.</p>

<p>That done, our day of marriage shall be yours,</p>

<p>One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.</p>
