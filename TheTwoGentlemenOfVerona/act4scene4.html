<p><center><i>[Enter Lance, with his dog, Crab.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lance</sc>  When a man’s servant shall play the cur with</p>

<p>him, look you, it goes hard–one that I brought up</p>

<p>of a puppy, one that I saved from drowning when</p>

<p>three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went</p>

<p>to it. I have taught him even as one would say</p>

<p>precisely “Thus I would teach a dog.” I was sent to</p>

<p>deliver him as a present to Mistress Sylvia from my</p>

<p>master; and I came no sooner into the dining</p>

<p>chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals</p>

<p>her capon’s leg. O, ’tis a foul thing when a cur</p>

<p>cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have,</p>

<p>as one should say, one that takes upon him to be a</p>

<p>dog indeed; to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I</p>

<p>had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon</p>

<p>me that he did, I think verily he had been hanged</p>

<p>for ’t. Sure as I live, he had suffered for ’t. You shall</p>

<p>judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of</p>

<p>three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the Duke’s</p>

<p>table; he had not been there–bless the mark!–a</p>

<p>pissing while but all the chamber smelt him. “Out</p>

<p>with the dog!” says one. “What cur is that?” says</p>

<p>another. “Whip him out!” says the third. “Hang him</p>

<p>up!” says the Duke. I, having been acquainted with</p>

<p>the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to</p>

<p>the fellow that whips the dogs. “Friend,” quoth I,</p>

<p>“You mean to whip the dog?” “Ay, marry, do I,”</p>

<p>quoth he. “You do him the more wrong,” quoth I.</p>

<p>“’Twas I did the thing you wot of.” He makes me no</p>

<p>more ado but whips me out of the chamber. How</p>

<p>many masters would do this for his servant? Nay,</p>

<p>I’ll be sworn I have sat in the stocks for puddings he</p>

<p>hath stolen; otherwise he had been executed. I have</p>

<p>stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed; otherwise</p>

<p>he had suffered for ’t. <i>[To Crab.]</i> Thou think’st</p>

<p>not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you</p>

<p>served me when I took my leave of Madam Sylvia.</p>

<p>Did not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do?</p>

<p>When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make</p>

<p>water against a gentlewoman’s farthingale? Didst</p>

<p>thou ever see me do such a trick?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Proteus and Julia disguised as Sebastian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well</p>

<p>And will employ thee in some service presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>In what you please. I’ll do what I can.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>I hope thou wilt. <i>[To Lance.]</i> How now, you</p>

<p>whoreson peasant?</p>

<p>Where have you been these two days loitering?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lance</sc>  Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Sylvia the dog you</p>

<p>bade me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  And what says she to my little jewel?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lance</sc>  Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells</p>

<p>you currish thanks is good enough for such a</p>

<p>present.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  But she received my dog?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lance</sc>  No, indeed, did she not. Here have I brought</p>

<p>him back again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  What, didst thou offer her this from me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lance</sc>  Ay, sir. The other squirrel was stolen from me</p>

<p>by the hangman’s boys in the market-place, and</p>

<p>then I offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as</p>

<p>ten of yours, and therefore the gift the greater.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Go, get thee hence, and find my dog again,</p>

<p>Or ne’er return again into my sight.</p>

<p>Away, I say. Stayest thou to vex me here?</p>

<p><center><i>[Lance exits with Crab.]</i></center></p>

<p>A slave that still an end turns me to shame.</p>

<p>Sebastian, I have entertained thee,</p>

<p>Partly that I have need of such a youth</p>

<p>That can with some discretion do my business–</p>

<p>For ’tis no trusting to yond foolish lout–</p>

<p>But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,</p>

<p>Which, if my augury deceive me not,</p>

<p>Witness good bringing-up, fortune, and truth.</p>

<p>Therefore, know thou, for this I entertain thee.</p>

<p>Go presently, and take this ring with thee;</p>

<p>Deliver it to Madam Sylvia.</p>

<p>She loved me well delivered it to me.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives her a ring.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.</p>

<p>She is dead belike?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  Not so; I think she lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Alas!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  Why dost thou cry “Alas”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  I cannot choose but pity her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>Because methinks that she loved you as well</p>

<p>As you do love your lady Sylvia.</p>

<p>She dreams on him that has forgot her love;</p>

<p>You dote on her that cares not for your love.</p>

<p>’Tis pity love should be so contrary,</p>

<p>And thinking on it makes me cry “Alas.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Well, give her that ring and therewithal</p>

<p>This letter. <i>[He gives her a paper.]</i> That’s her</p>

<p>chamber. Tell my lady</p>

<p>I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.</p>

<p>Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,</p>

<p>Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary.</p>

<p><center><i>[Proteus exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>How many women would do such a message?</p>

<p>Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertained</p>

<p>A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.</p>

<p>Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him</p>

<p>That with his very heart despiseth me?</p>

<p>Because he loves her, he despiseth me;</p>

<p>Because I love him, I must pity him.</p>

<p>This ring I gave him when he parted from me,</p>

<p>To bind him to remember my good will;</p>

<p>And now am I, unhappy messenger,</p>

<p>To plead for that which I would not obtain,</p>

<p>To carry that which I would have refused,</p>

<p>To praise his faith, which I would have dispraised.</p>

<p>I am my master’s true confirmed love,</p>

<p>But cannot be true servant to my master</p>

<p>Unless I prove false traitor to myself.</p>

<p>Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly</p>

<p>As–Heaven it knows!–I would not have him</p>

<p>speed.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sylvia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><i>[As Sebastian.]</i> Gentlewoman, good day. I pray you be</p>

<p>my mean</p>

<p>To bring me where to speak with Madam Sylvia.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>What would you with her, if that I be she?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>If you be she, I do entreat your patience</p>

<p>To hear me speak the message I am sent on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc>  From whom?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  From my master, Sir Proteus,</p>

<p>madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc>  O, he sends you for a picture?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Ay, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc> <i>[calling]</i>  Ursula, bring my picture there.</p>

<p><center><i>[She is brought the picture.]</i></center></p>

<p>Go, give your master this. Tell him from me,</p>

<p>One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,</p>

<p>Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Madam, please you peruse this</p>

<p>letter.     <i><i>[She gives Sylvia a paper.]</i></i></p>

<p>Pardon me, madam, I have unadvised</p>

<p>Delivered you a paper that I should not.</p>

<p>This is the letter to your Ladyship.</p>

<p><center><i>[She takes back the first paper</p>

<p>and hands Sylvia another.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>I pray thee let me look on that again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>It may not be; good madam, pardon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc>  There, hold.</p>

<p>I will not look upon your master’s lines;</p>

<p>I know they are stuffed with protestations</p>

<p>And full of new-found oaths, which he will break</p>

<p>As easily as I do tear his paper.</p>

<p><center><i>[She tears the second paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>Madam, he sends your Ladyship this ring.</p>

<p><center><i>[She offers Sylvia a ring.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>The more shame for him, that he sends it me;</p>

<p>For I have heard him say a thousand times</p>

<p>His Julia gave it him at his departure.</p>

<p>Though his false finger have profaned the ring,</p>

<p>Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  She thanks you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc>  What sayst thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>I thank you, madam, that you tender her;</p>

<p>Poor gentlewoman, my master wrongs her much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc>  Dost thou know her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>Almost as well as I do know myself.</p>

<p>To think upon her woes, I do protest</p>

<p>That I have wept a hundred several times.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>I think she doth, and that’s her cause of sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc>  Is she not passing fair?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>She hath been fairer, madam, than she is;</p>

<p>When she did think my master loved her well,</p>

<p>She, in my judgment, was as fair as you.</p>

<p>But since she did neglect her looking-glass</p>

<p>And threw her sun-expelling mask away,</p>

<p>The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks</p>

<p>And pinched the lily tincture of her face,</p>

<p>That now she is become as black as I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc>  How tall was she?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>About my stature; for at Pentecost,</p>

<p>When all our pageants of delight were played,</p>

<p>Our youth got me to play the woman’s part,</p>

<p>And I was trimmed in Madam Julia’s gown,</p>

<p>Which served me as fit, by all men’s judgments,</p>

<p>As if the garment had been made for me;</p>

<p>Therefore I know she is about my height.</p>

<p>And at that time I made her weep agood,</p>

<p>For I did play a lamentable part;</p>

<p>Madam, ’twas Ariadne, passioning</p>

<p>For Theseus’ perjury and unjust flight,</p>

<p>Which I so lively acted with my tears</p>

<p>That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,</p>

<p>Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead</p>

<p>If I in thought felt not her very sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.</p>

<p>Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!</p>

<p>I weep myself to think upon thy words.</p>

<p>Here, youth, there is my purse.</p>

<p><center><i>[She gives Julia a purse.]</i></center></p>

<p>I give thee this</p>

<p>For thy sweet mistress’ sake, because thou lov’st her.</p>

<p>Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>And she shall thank you for ’t if e’er you know her.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sylvia exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful.</p>

<p>I hope my master’s suit will be but cold,</p>

<p>Since she respects my mistress’ love so much.–</p>

<p>Alas, how love can trifle with itself!</p>

<p>Here is her picture; let me see. I think</p>

<p>If I had such a tire, this face of mine</p>

<p>Were full as lovely as is this of hers;</p>

<p>And yet the painter flattered her a little,</p>

<p>Unless I flatter with myself too much.</p>

<p>Her hair is auburn; mine is perfect yellow;</p>

<p>If that be all the difference in his love,</p>

<p>I’ll get me such a colored periwig.</p>

<p>Her eyes are gray as glass, and so are mine.</p>

<p>Ay, but her forehead’s low, and mine’s as high.</p>

<p>What should it be that he respects in her</p>

<p>But I can make respective in myself</p>

<p>If this fond Love were not a blinded god?</p>

<p>Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up,</p>

<p>For ’tis thy rival. O, thou senseless form,</p>

<p>Thou shalt be worshipped, kissed, loved, and</p>

<p>adored;</p>

<p>And were there sense in his idolatry,</p>

<p>My substance should be statue in thy stead.</p>

<p>I’ll use thee kindly for thy mistress’ sake,</p>

<p>That used me so, or else, by Jove I vow,</p>

<p>I should have scratched out your unseeing eyes</p>

<p>To make my master out of love with thee.</p>
