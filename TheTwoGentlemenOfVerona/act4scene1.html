<p><center><i>[Enter certain Outlaws.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>Fellows, stand fast. I see a passenger.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>If there be ten, shrink not, but down with ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Valentine and Speed.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about you.</p>

<p>If not, we’ll make you sit, and rifle you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span> <i>[to Valentine]</i></p>

<p>Sir, we are undone; these are the villains</p>

<p>That all the travelers do fear so much.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  My friends–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>That’s not so, sir. We are your enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span>  Peace. We’ll hear him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>Ay, by my beard, will we, for he is a proper man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Then know that I have little wealth to lose.</p>

<p>A man I am crossed with adversity;</p>

<p>My riches are these poor habiliments,</p>

<p>Of which, if you should here disfurnish me,</p>

<p>You take the sum and substance that I have.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span>  Whither travel you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  To Verona.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span>  Whence came you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  From Milan.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span>  Have you long sojourned there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Some sixteen months, and longer might have stayed</p>

<p>If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span>  What, were you banished thence?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  I was.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span>  For what offense?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>For that which now torments me to rehearse;</p>

<p>I killed a man, whose death I much repent,</p>

<p>But yet I slew him manfully in fight</p>

<p>Without false vantage or base treachery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>Why, ne’er repent it if it were done so;</p>

<p>But were you banished for so small a fault?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>I was, and held me glad of such a doom.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span>  Have you the tongues?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>My youthful travel therein made me happy,</p>

<p>Or else I often had been miserable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>By the bare scalp of Robin Hood’s fat friar,</p>

<p>This fellow were a king for our wild faction.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span>  We’ll have him.–Sirs, a word.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Outlaws step aside to talk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Master, be one of them. It’s an honorable kind</p>

<p>of thievery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Peace, villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span> <i>[advancing]</i></p>

<p>Tell us this: have you anything to take to?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Nothing but my fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>Know then that some of us are gentlemen,</p>

<p>Such as the fury of ungoverned youth</p>

<p>Thrust from the company of awful men.</p>

<p>Myself was from Verona banished</p>

<p>For practicing to steal away a lady,</p>

<p>An heir and near allied unto the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>And I from Mantua, for a gentleman</p>

<p>Who, in my mood, I stabbed unto the heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>And I for such like petty crimes as these.</p>

<p>But to the purpose: for we cite our faults</p>

<p>That they may hold excused our lawless lives,</p>

<p>And partly seeing you are beautified</p>

<p>With goodly shape, and by your own report</p>

<p>A linguist, and a man of such perfection</p>

<p>As we do in our quality much want–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>Indeed because you are a banished man,</p>

<p>Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you.</p>

<p>Are you content to be our general,</p>

<p>To make a virtue of necessity</p>

<p>And live as we do in this wilderness?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>What sayst thou? Wilt thou be of our consort?</p>

<p>Say ay, and be the captain of us all;</p>

<p>We’ll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,</p>

<p>Love thee as our commander and our king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>I take your offer and will live with you,</p>

<p>Provided that you do no outrages</p>

<p>On silly women or poor passengers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Outlaw</span></p>

<p>No, we detest such vile base practices.</p>

<p>Come, go with us; we’ll bring thee to our crews</p>

<p>And show thee all the treasure we have got,</p>

<p>Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.</p>
