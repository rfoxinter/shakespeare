<p><center><i>[Enter Proteus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Already have I been false to Valentine,</p>

<p>And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.</p>

<p>Under the color of commending him,</p>

<p>I have access my own love to prefer.</p>

<p>But Sylvia is too fair, too true, too holy</p>

<p>To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.</p>

<p>When I protest true loyalty to her,</p>

<p>She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;</p>

<p>When to her beauty I commend my vows,</p>

<p>She bids me think how I have been forsworn</p>

<p>In breaking faith with Julia, whom I loved;</p>

<p>And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,</p>

<p>The least whereof would quell a lover’s hope,</p>

<p>Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,</p>

<p>The more it grows and fawneth on her still.</p>

<p>But here comes Thurio. Now must we to her</p>

<p>window</p>

<p>And give some evening music to her ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Thurio and Musicians.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thurio</sc></p>

<p>How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Ay, gentle Thurio, for you know that love</p>

<p>Will creep in service where it cannot go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thurio</sc></p>

<p>Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Sir, but I do, or else I would be hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thurio</sc></p>

<p>Who, Sylvia?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  Ay, Sylvia, for your sake.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thurio</sc></p>

<p>I thank you for your own.–Now, gentlemen,</p>

<p>Let’s tune, and to it lustily awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Host of the inn, and Julia, disguised as a</p>

<p>page, Sebastian. They stand at a distance and talk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Now, my young guest, methinks you’re allycholly.</p>

<p>I pray you, why is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Marry, mine host, because I</p>

<p>cannot be merry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Come, we’ll have you merry. I’ll bring you where</p>

<p>you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you</p>

<p>asked for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  But shall I hear him speak?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Ay, that you shall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  That will be music.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Hark, hark.     <i><i>[Music plays.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Is he among these?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Ay. But peace; let’s hear ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p>Song.</p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>     <i>Who is Sylvia? What is she,</i></p>

<p>        <i>That all our swains commend her?</i></p>

<p>     <i>Holy, fair, and wise is she;</i></p>

<p>        <i>The heaven such grace did lend her</i></p>

<p>           <i>That she might admired be.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>Is she kind as she is fair?</i></p>

<p>        <i>For beauty lives with kindness.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Love doth to her eyes repair</i></p>

<p>        <i>To help him of his blindness;</i></p>

<p>           <i>And, being helped, inhabits there.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>Then to Sylvia let us sing,</i></p>

<p>        <i>That Sylvia is excelling;</i></p>

<p>     <i>She excels each mortal thing</i></p>

<p>        <i>Upon the dull earth dwelling.</i></p>

<p>           <i>To her let us garlands bring.</i></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  How now? Are you sadder than you were before?</p>

<p>How do you, man? The music likes you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  You mistake. The musician likes me</p>

<p>not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Why, my pretty youth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  He plays false, father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  How, out of tune on the strings?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Not so; but yet so false that he</p>

<p>grieves my very heart-strings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  You have a quick ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes</p>

<p>me have a slow heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  I perceive you delight not in music.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Not a whit when it jars so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Hark, what fine change is in the music!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Ay; that change is the spite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  You would have them always play but one</p>

<p>thing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>I would always have one play but one thing.</p>

<p>But, host, doth this Sir Proteus, that we talk on,</p>

<p>Often resort unto this gentlewoman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  I tell you what Lance his man told me: he loved</p>

<p>her out of all nick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Where is Lance?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Gone to seek his dog, which tomorrow, by his</p>

<p>master’s command, he must carry for a present to</p>

<p>his lady.     <i><i>[Music ends.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Peace. Stand aside. The company</p>

<p>parts.     <i><i>[Host and Julia move away.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Sir Thurio, fear not you. I will so plead</p>

<p>That you shall say my cunning drift excels.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thurio</sc></p>

<p>Where meet we?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  At Saint Gregory’s well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thurio</sc>  Farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[Thurio and the Musicians exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sylvia, above.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Madam, good even to your Ladyship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>I thank you for your music, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Who is that that spake?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>One, lady, if you knew his pure heart’s truth,</p>

<p>You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc>  Sir Proteus, as I take it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>What’s your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  That I may compass yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>You have your wish: my will is even this,</p>

<p>That presently you hie you home to bed.</p>

<p>Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man,</p>

<p>Think’st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,</p>

<p>To be seduced by thy flattery,</p>

<p>That hast deceived so many with thy vows?</p>

<p>Return, return, and make thy love amends.</p>

<p>For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,</p>

<p>I am so far from granting thy request</p>

<p>That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit</p>

<p>And by and by intend to chide myself</p>

<p>Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady,</p>

<p>But she is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  ’Twere false if I should speak it,</p>

<p>For I am sure she is not buried.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend</p>

<p>Survives, to whom, thyself art witness,</p>

<p>I am betrothed. And art thou not ashamed</p>

<p>To wrong him with thy importunacy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>And so suppose am I, for in his grave,</p>

<p>Assure thyself, my love is buried.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>Go to thy lady’s grave and call hers thence,</p>

<p>Or, at the least, in hers sepulcher thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He heard not that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,</p>

<p>Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,</p>

<p>The picture that is hanging in your chamber;</p>

<p>To that I’ll speak, to that I’ll sigh and weep,</p>

<p>For since the substance of your perfect self</p>

<p>Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;</p>

<p>And to your shadow will I make true love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>If ’twere a substance you would sure deceive it</p>

<p>And make it but a shadow, as I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sylvia</sc></p>

<p>I am very loath to be your idol, sir;</p>

<p>But since your falsehood shall become you well</p>

<p>To worship shadows and adore false shapes,</p>

<p>Send to me in the morning, and I’ll send it.</p>

<p>And so, good rest.     <i><i>[Sylvia exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  As wretches have o’ernight</p>

<p>That wait for execution in the morn.     <i><i>[Proteus exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Host, will you go?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  By my halidom, I was fast asleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i>  Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Host</sc>  Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think ’tis almost</p>

<p>day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[as Sebastian]</i></p>

<p>Not so; but it hath been the longest night</p>

<p>That e’er I watched, and the most heaviest.</p>
