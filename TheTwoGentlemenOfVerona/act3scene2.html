<p><center><i>[Enter Duke and Thurio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you</p>

<p>Now Valentine is banished from her sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thurio</sc></p>

<p>Since his exile she hath despised me most,</p>

<p>Forsworn my company and railed at me,</p>

<p>That I am desperate of obtaining her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>This weak impress of love is as a figure</p>

<p>Trenched in ice, which with an hour’s heat</p>

<p>Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.</p>

<p>A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,</p>

<p>And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Proteus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Sir Proteus? Is your countryman,</p>

<p>According to our proclamation, gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  Gone, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>My daughter takes his going grievously.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>So I believe, but Thurio thinks not so.</p>

<p>Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee,</p>

<p>For thou hast shown some sign of good desert,</p>

<p>Makes me the better to confer with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace</p>

<p>Let me not live to look upon your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Thou know’st how willingly I would effect</p>

<p>The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc>  I do, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>And also, I think, thou art not ignorant</p>

<p>How she opposes her against my will?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Ay, and perversely she persevers so.</p>

<p>What might we do to make the girl forget</p>

<p>The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>The best way is to slander Valentine</p>

<p>With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent,</p>

<p>Three things that women highly hold in hate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Ay, but she’ll think that it is spoke in hate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Ay, if his enemy deliver it.</p>

<p>Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken</p>

<p>By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Then you must undertake to slander him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do.</p>

<p>’Tis an ill office for a gentleman,</p>

<p>Especially against his very friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Where your good word cannot advantage him,</p>

<p>Your slander never can endamage him;</p>

<p>Therefore the office is indifferent,</p>

<p>Being entreated to it by your friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>You have prevailed, my lord. If I can do it</p>

<p>By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,</p>

<p>She shall not long continue love to him.</p>

<p>But say this weed her love from Valentine,</p>

<p>It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thurio</sc></p>

<p>Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,</p>

<p>Lest it should ravel and be good to none,</p>

<p>You must provide to bottom it on me,</p>

<p>Which must be done by praising me as much</p>

<p>As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind</p>

<p>Because we know, on Valentine’s report,</p>

<p>You are already Love’s firm votary</p>

<p>And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.</p>

<p>Upon this warrant shall you have access</p>

<p>Where you with Sylvia may confer at large–</p>

<p>For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,</p>

<p>And, for your friend’s sake, will be glad of you–</p>

<p>Where you may temper her by your persuasion</p>

<p>To hate young Valentine and love my friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>As much as I can do I will effect.–</p>

<p>But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough.</p>

<p>You must lay lime to tangle her desires</p>

<p>By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes</p>

<p>Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Ay, much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Say that upon the altar of her beauty</p>

<p>You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart.</p>

<p>Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears</p>

<p>Moist it again, and frame some feeling line</p>

<p>That may discover such integrity.</p>

<p>For Orpheus’ lute was strung with poets’ sinews,</p>

<p>Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,</p>

<p>Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans</p>

<p>Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.</p>

<p>After your dire-lamenting elegies,</p>

<p>Visit by night your lady’s chamber window</p>

<p>With some sweet consort; to their instruments</p>

<p>Tune a deploring dump; the night’s dead silence</p>

<p>Will well become such sweet complaining</p>

<p>grievance.</p>

<p>This, or else nothing, will inherit her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>This discipline shows thou hast been in love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thurio</sc> <i>[to Proteus]</i></p>

<p>And thy advice this night I’ll put in practice.</p>

<p>Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,</p>

<p>Let us into the city presently</p>

<p>To sort some gentlemen well-skilled in music.</p>

<p>I have a sonnet that will serve the turn</p>

<p>To give the onset to thy good advice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  About it, gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>We’ll wait upon your Grace till after supper</p>

<p>And afterward determine our proceedings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Even now about it! I will pardon you.</p>
