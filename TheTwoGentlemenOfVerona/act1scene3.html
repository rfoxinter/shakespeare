<p><center><i>[Enter Antonio and Pantino.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Tell me, Pantino, what sad talk was that</p>

<p>Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pantino</sc></p>

<p>’Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Why, what of him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pantino</sc>  He wondered that your Lordship</p>

<p>Would suffer him to spend his youth at home</p>

<p>While other men, of slender reputation,</p>

<p>Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:</p>

<p>Some to the wars to try their fortune there,</p>

<p>Some to discover islands far away,</p>

<p>Some to the studious universities.</p>

<p>For any or for all these exercises</p>

<p>He said that Proteus your son was meet,</p>

<p>And did request me to importune you</p>

<p>To let him spend his time no more at home,</p>

<p>Which would be great impeachment to his age</p>

<p>In having known no travel in his youth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Nor need’st thou much importune me to that</p>

<p>Whereon this month I have been hammering.</p>

<p>I have considered well his loss of time</p>

<p>And how he cannot be a perfect man,</p>

<p>Not being tried and tutored in the world.</p>

<p>Experience is by industry achieved</p>

<p>And perfected by the swift course of time.</p>

<p>Then tell me whither were I best to send him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pantino</sc></p>

<p>I think your Lordship is not ignorant</p>

<p>How his companion, youthful Valentine,</p>

<p>Attends the Emperor in his royal court.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  I know it well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pantino</sc></p>

<p>’Twere good, I think, your Lordship sent him thither.</p>

<p>There shall he practice tilts and tournaments,</p>

<p>Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,</p>

<p>And be in eye of every exercise</p>

<p>Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>I like thy counsel. Well hast thou advised,</p>

<p>And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,</p>

<p>The execution of it shall make known.</p>

<p>Even with the speediest expedition</p>

<p>I will dispatch him to the Emperor’s court.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pantino</sc></p>

<p>Tomorrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,</p>

<p>With other gentlemen of good esteem,</p>

<p>Are journeying to salute the Emperor</p>

<p>And to commend their service to his will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Good company. With them shall Proteus go.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Proteus reading.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>And in good time! Now will we break with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc> <i>[to himself]</i></p>

<p>Sweet love, sweet lines, sweet life!</p>

<p>Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;</p>

<p>Here is her oath for love, her honor’s pawn.</p>

<p>O, that our fathers would applaud our loves</p>

<p>To seal our happiness with their consents.</p>

<p>O heavenly Julia!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>How now? What letter are you reading there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>May ’t please your Lordship, ’tis a word or two</p>

<p>Of commendations sent from Valentine,</p>

<p>Delivered by a friend that came from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Lend me the letter. Let me see what news.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>There is no news, my lord, but that he writes</p>

<p>How happily he lives, how well beloved</p>

<p>And daily graced by the Emperor,</p>

<p>Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>And how stand you affected to his wish?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>As one relying on your Lordship’s will,</p>

<p>And not depending on his friendly wish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>My will is something sorted with his wish.</p>

<p>Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed,</p>

<p>For what I will, I will, and there an end.</p>

<p>I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time</p>

<p>With Valentinus in the Emperor’s court.</p>

<p>What maintenance he from his friends receives,</p>

<p>Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.</p>

<p>Tomorrow be in readiness to go.</p>

<p>Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I cannot be so soon provided.</p>

<p>Please you deliberate a day or two.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Look what thou want’st shall be sent after thee.</p>

<p>No more of stay. Tomorrow thou must go.–</p>

<p>Come on, Pantino; you shall be employed</p>

<p>To hasten on his expedition.</p>

<p><center><i>[Antonio and Pantino exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Thus have I shunned the fire for fear of burning</p>

<p>And drenched me in the sea, where I am drowned.</p>

<p>I feared to show my father Julia’s letter</p>

<p>Lest he should take exceptions to my love,</p>

<p>And with the vantage of mine own excuse</p>

<p>Hath he excepted most against my love.</p>

<p>O, how this spring of love resembleth</p>

<p>The uncertain glory of an April day,</p>

<p>Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,</p>

<p>And by and by a cloud takes all away.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pantino.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pantino</sc></p>

<p>Sir Proteus, your father calls for you.</p>

<p>He is in haste. Therefore, I pray you, go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Proteus</sc></p>

<p>Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto.</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> And yet a thousand times it answers “no.”</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
