<p><center><i>[Enter Valentine and Proteus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus.</p>

<p>Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.</p>

<p>Were ’t not affection chains thy tender days</p>

<p>To the sweet glances of thy honored love,</p>

<p>I rather would entreat thy company</p>

<p>To see the wonders of the world abroad</p>

<p>Than, living dully sluggardized at home,</p>

<p>Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.</p>

<p>But since thou lov’st, love still and thrive therein,</p>

<p>Even as I would when I to love begin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu.</p>

<p>Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest</p>

<p>Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel.</p>

<p>Wish me partaker in thy happiness</p>

<p>When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,</p>

<p>If ever danger do environ thee,</p>

<p>Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,</p>

<p>For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>And on a love-book pray for my success?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Upon some book I love I’ll pray for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>That’s on some shallow story of deep love,</p>

<p>How young Leander crossed the Hellespont.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>That’s a deep story of a deeper love,</p>

<p>For he was more than over shoes in love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>’Tis true, for you are over boots in love,</p>

<p>And yet you never swam the Hellespont.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Over the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>No, I will not, for it boots thee not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  What?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans,</p>

<p>Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading</p>

<p>moment’s mirth</p>

<p>With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights;</p>

<p>If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;</p>

<p>If lost, why then a grievous labor won;</p>

<p>How ever, but a folly bought with wit,</p>

<p>Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>So, by your circumstance, I fear you’ll prove.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>’Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Love is your master, for he masters you;</p>

<p>And he that is so yoked by a fool</p>

<p>Methinks should not be chronicled for wise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Yet writers say: as in the sweetest bud</p>

<p>The eating canker dwells, so eating love</p>

<p>Inhabits in the finest wits of all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>And writers say: as the most forward bud</p>

<p>Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,</p>

<p>Even so by love the young and tender wit</p>

<p>Is turned to folly, blasting in the bud,</p>

<p>Losing his verdure, even in the prime,</p>

<p>And all the fair effects of future hopes.</p>

<p>But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee</p>

<p>That art a votary to fond desire?</p>

<p>Once more adieu. My father at the road</p>

<p>Expects my coming, there to see me shipped.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Sweet Proteus, no. Now let us take our leave.</p>

<p>To Milan let me hear from thee by letters</p>

<p>Of thy success in love, and what news else</p>

<p>Betideth here in absence of thy friend.</p>

<p>And I likewise will visit thee with mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>All happiness bechance to thee in Milan.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>As much to you at home. And so farewell.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>He after honor hunts, I after love.</p>

<p>He leaves his friends, to dignify them more;</p>

<p>I leave myself, my friends, and all, for love.</p>

<p>Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,</p>

<p>Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,</p>

<p>War with good counsel, set the world at nought;</p>

<p>Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Speed.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span></p>

<p>Sir Proteus, ’save you. Saw you my master?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span></p>

<p>Twenty to one, then, he is shipped already,</p>

<p>And I have played the sheep in losing him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,</p>

<p>An if the shepherd be awhile away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  You conclude that my master is a shepherd,</p>

<p>then, and I a sheep?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Why, then my horns are his horns, whether I</p>

<p>wake or sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  This proves me still a sheep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  True, and thy master a shepherd.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  It shall go hard but I’ll prove it by another.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the</p>

<p>sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my</p>

<p>master seeks not me. Therefore I am no sheep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the</p>

<p>shepherd for food follows not the sheep. Thou for</p>

<p>wages followest thy master; thy master for wages</p>

<p>follows not thee. Therefore thou art a sheep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Such another proof will make me cry “baa.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  But dost thou hear? Gav’st thou my letter to</p>

<p>Julia?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Ay, sir. I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a</p>

<p>laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a</p>

<p>lost mutton, nothing for my labor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Here’s too small a pasture for such store of</p>

<p>muttons.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  If the ground be overcharged, you were best</p>

<p>stick her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Nay, in that you are astray; ’twere best pound</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for</p>

<p>carrying your letter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  You mistake; I mean the pound, a pinfold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span></p>

<p>From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,</p>

<p>’Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your</p>

<p>lover.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  But what said she?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span> <i>[nodding]</i>  Ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Nod–“Ay.” Why, that’s “noddy.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  You mistook, sir. I say she did nod, and you ask</p>

<p>me if she did nod, and I say “ay.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  And that set together is “noddy.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Now you have taken the pains to set it together,</p>

<p>take it for your pains.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Why, sir, how do you bear with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing</p>

<p>but the word “noddy” for my pains.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Come, come, open the matter in brief. What</p>

<p>said she?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Open your purse, that the money and the matter</p>

<p>may be both at once delivered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span> <i>[giving money]</i>  Well, sir, here is for your</p>

<p>pains. What said she?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span> <i>[looking at the money]</i>  Truly, sir, I think you’ll</p>

<p>hardly win her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Why? Couldst thou perceive so much from</p>

<p>her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her, no,</p>

<p>not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter.</p>

<p>And being so hard to me that brought your mind, I</p>

<p>fear she’ll prove as hard to you in telling your mind.</p>

<p>Give her no token but stones, for she’s as hard as</p>

<p>steel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  What said she? Nothing?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  No, not so much as “Take this for thy pains.”</p>

<p>To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have</p>

<p>testerned me. In requital whereof, henceforth</p>

<p>carry your letters yourself. And so, sir, I’ll commend</p>

<p>you to my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Go, go, begone, to save your ship from wrack,</p>

<p>Which cannot perish having thee aboard,</p>

<p>Being destined to a drier death on shore.</p>

<p><center><i>[Speed exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>I must go send some better messenger.</p>

<p>I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,</p>

<p>Receiving them from such a worthless post.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
