<p><center><i>[Enter Julia and Lucetta.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,</p>

<p>Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>Of all the fair resort of gentlemen</p>

<p>That every day with parle encounter me,</p>

<p>In thy opinion which is worthiest love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Please you repeat their names, I’ll show my mind</p>

<p>According to my shallow simple skill.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>What think’st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;</p>

<p>But, were I you, he never should be mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>What think’st thou of the rich Mercatio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Well of his wealth, but of himself so-so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>What think’st thou of the gentle Proteus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Lord, Lord, to see what folly reigns in us!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>How now? What means this passion at his name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Pardon, dear madam, ’tis a passing shame</p>

<p>That I, unworthy body as I am,</p>

<p>Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Then thus: of many good, I think him best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc>  Your reason?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>I have no other but a woman’s reason:</p>

<p>I think him so because I think him so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>Why, he of all the rest hath never moved me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Yet he of all the rest I think best loves you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>His little speaking shows his love but small.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Fire that’s closest kept burns most of all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>They do not love that do not show their love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>O, they love least that let men know their love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc>  I would I knew his mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc> <i>[handing her a paper]</i>  Peruse this paper,</p>

<p>madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[reads]</i>  “To Julia.”–Say from whom.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc>  That the contents will show.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc>  Say, say who gave it thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Sir Valentine’s page; and sent, I think, from</p>

<p>Proteus.</p>

<p>He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,</p>

<p>Did in your name receive it. Pardon the fault, I pray.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!</p>

<p>Dare you presume to harbor wanton lines?</p>

<p>To whisper and conspire against my youth?</p>

<p>Now trust me, ’tis an office of great worth,</p>

<p>And you an officer fit for the place.</p>

<p>There, take the paper; see it be returned,</p>

<p>Or else return no more into my sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc> <i>[taking the paper]</i></p>

<p>To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>Will you be gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc>  That you may ruminate.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>And yet I would I had o’erlooked the letter.</p>

<p>It were a shame to call her back again</p>

<p>And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.</p>

<p>What fool is she that knows I am a maid</p>

<p>And would not force the letter to my view,</p>

<p>Since maids in modesty say “no” to that</p>

<p>Which they would have the profferer construe “ay”!</p>

<p>Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love</p>

<p>That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse</p>

<p>And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!</p>

<p>How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,</p>

<p>When willingly I would have had her here!</p>

<p>How angerly I taught my brow to frown,</p>

<p>When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!</p>

<p>My penance is to call Lucetta back</p>

<p>And ask remission for my folly past.–</p>

<p>What ho, Lucetta!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucetta.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc>  What would your Ladyship?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>Is ’t near dinner time?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc>  I would it were,</p>

<p>That you might kill your stomach on your meat</p>

<p>And not upon your maid.</p>

<p><center><i>[She drops a paper and then retrieves it.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>What is ’t that you took up so gingerly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc>  Nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc>  Why didst thou stoop, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>To take a paper up that I let fall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc>  And is that paper nothing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc>  Nothing concerning me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>Then let it lie for those that it concerns.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Madam, it will not lie where it concerns</p>

<p>Unless it have a false interpreter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>That I might sing it, madam, to a tune,</p>

<p>Give me a note. Your Ladyship can set–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>As little by such toys as may be possible.</p>

<p>Best sing it to the tune of “Light o’ Love.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>It is too heavy for so light a tune.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>Heavy? Belike it hath some burden then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>And why not you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc>  I cannot reach so high.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc> <i>[taking the paper]</i></p>

<p>Let’s see your song. How now, minion!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.</p>

<p>And yet methinks I do not like this tune.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc>  You do not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc>  No, madam, ’tis too sharp.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc>  You, minion, are too saucy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc>  Nay, now you are too flat</p>

<p>And mar the concord with too harsh a descant.</p>

<p>There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>The mean is drowned with your unruly bass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.</p>

<p>Here is a coil with protestation.</p>

<p><center><i>[She rips up the paper. Lucetta begins</p>

<p>to pick up the pieces.]</i></center></p>

<p>Go, get you gone, and let the papers lie.</p>

<p>You would be fing’ring them to anger me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>She makes it strange, but she would be best pleased</p>

<p>To be so angered with another letter.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>Nay, would I were so angered with the same!</p>

<p>O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!</p>

<p>Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey</p>

<p>And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!</p>

<p>I’ll kiss each several paper for amends.</p>

<p><center><i>[She picks up some pieces.]</i></center></p>

<p>Look, here is writ “kind Julia.” Unkind Julia,</p>

<p>As in revenge of thy ingratitude,</p>

<p>I throw thy name against the bruising stones,</p>

<p>Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.</p>

<p>And here is writ “love-wounded Proteus.”</p>

<p>Poor wounded name, my bosom as a bed</p>

<p>Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly healed,</p>

<p>And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.</p>

<p>But twice or thrice was “Proteus” written down.</p>

<p>Be calm, good wind. Blow not a word away</p>

<p>Till I have found each letter in the letter</p>

<p>Except mine own name. That some whirlwind bear</p>

<p>Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock</p>

<p>And throw it thence into the raging sea.</p>

<p>Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:</p>

<p>“Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,</p>

<p>To the sweet Julia.” That I’ll tear away–</p>

<p>And yet I will not, sith so prettily</p>

<p>He couples it to his complaining names.</p>

<p>Thus will I fold them one upon another.</p>

<p>Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucetta.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Madam, dinner is ready, and your father stays.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc>  Well, let us go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>What, shall these papers lie like telltales here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>If you respect them, best to take them up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Nay, I was taken up for laying them down.</p>

<p>Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.</p>

<p><center><i>[She picks up the rest of the pieces.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc></p>

<p>I see you have a month’s mind to them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucetta</sc></p>

<p>Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;</p>

<p>I see things too, although you judge I wink.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Julia</sc>  Come, come, will ’t please you go?</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
