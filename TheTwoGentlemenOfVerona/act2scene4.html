<p><center><i>[Enter Valentine, Sylvia, Thurio, and Speed.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span>  Servant!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Mistress?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Ay, boy, it’s for love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Not of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Of my mistress, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  ’Twere good you knocked him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span> <i>[to Valentine]</i>  Servant, you are sad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Indeed, madam, I seem so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thurio</span>  Seem you that you are not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Haply I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thurio</span>  So do counterfeits.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  So do you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thurio</span>  What seem I that I am not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Wise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thurio</span>  What instance of the contrary?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Your folly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thurio</span>  And how quote you my folly?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  I quote it in your jerkin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thurio</span>  My “jerkin” is a doublet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Well, then, I’ll double your folly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thurio</span>  How!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span>  What, angry, Sir Thurio? Do you change color?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Give him leave, madam. He is a kind of</p>

<p>chameleon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thurio</span>  That hath more mind to feed on your blood</p>

<p>than live in your air.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  You have said, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thurio</span>  Ay, sir, and done too for this time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  I know it well, sir. You always end ere you</p>

<p>begin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span>  A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly</p>

<p>shot off.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  ’Tis indeed, madam. We thank the giver.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span>  Who is that, servant?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Yourself, sweet lady, for you gave the fire.</p>

<p>Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your Ladyship’s</p>

<p>looks and spends what he borrows kindly in your</p>

<p>company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thurio</span>  Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall</p>

<p>make your wit bankrupt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  I know it well, sir. You have an exchequer</p>

<p>of words and, I think, no other treasure to give your</p>

<p>followers, for it appears by their bare liveries that</p>

<p>they live by your bare words.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>No more, gentlemen, no more. Here comes my</p>

<p>father.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Duke.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Now, daughter Sylvia, you are hard beset.–</p>

<p>Sir Valentine, your father is in good health.</p>

<p>What say you to a letter from your friends</p>

<p>Of much good news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  My lord, I will be thankful</p>

<p>To any happy messenger from thence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Know you Don Antonio, your countryman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman</p>

<p>To be of worth and worthy estimation,</p>

<p>And not without desert so well reputed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span>  Hath he not a son?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord, a son that well deserves</p>

<p>The honor and regard of such a father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span>  You know him well?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>I knew him as myself, for from our infancy</p>

<p>We have conversed and spent our hours together,</p>

<p>And though myself have been an idle truant,</p>

<p>Omitting the sweet benefit of time</p>

<p>To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,</p>

<p>Yet hath Sir Proteus–for that’s his name–</p>

<p>Made use and fair advantage of his days:</p>

<p>His years but young, but his experience old;</p>

<p>His head unmellowed, but his judgment ripe;</p>

<p>And in a word–for far behind his worth</p>

<p>Comes all the praises that I now bestow–</p>

<p>He is complete in feature and in mind,</p>

<p>With all good grace to grace a gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,</p>

<p>He is as worthy for an empress’ love,</p>

<p>As meet to be an emperor’s counselor.</p>

<p>Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me</p>

<p>With commendation from great potentates,</p>

<p>And here he means to spend his time awhile.</p>

<p>I think ’tis no unwelcome news to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Should I have wished a thing, it had been he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Welcome him then according to his worth.</p>

<p>Sylvia, I speak to you–and you, Sir Thurio.</p>

<p>For Valentine, I need not cite him to it.</p>

<p>I will send him hither to you presently.     <i><i>[Duke exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>This is the gentleman I told your Ladyship</p>

<p>Had come along with me but that his mistress</p>

<p>Did hold his eyes locked in her crystal looks.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>Belike that now she hath enfranchised them</p>

<p>Upon some other pawn for fealty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>Nay, then, he should be blind, and being blind</p>

<p>How could he see his way to seek out you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Why, lady, love hath twenty pair of eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thurio</span></p>

<p>They say that Love hath not an eye at all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself.</p>

<p>Upon a homely object, Love can wink.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>Have done, have done. Here comes the gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Proteus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Welcome, dear Proteus.–Mistress, I beseech you</p>

<p>Confirm his welcome with some special favor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,</p>

<p>If this be he you oft have wished to hear from.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Mistress, it is. Sweet lady, entertain him</p>

<p>To be my fellow-servant to your Ladyship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>Too low a mistress for so high a servant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Not so, sweet lady, but too mean a servant</p>

<p>To have a look of such a worthy mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Leave off discourse of disability.</p>

<p>Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>My duty will I boast of, nothing else.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>And duty never yet did want his meed.</p>

<p>Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>I’ll die on him that says so but yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span>  That you are welcome?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  That you are worthless.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span></p>

<p>Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>I wait upon his pleasure. <i>[Servant exits.]</i> Come, Sir</p>

<p>Thurio,</p>

<p>Go with me.–Once more, new servant, welcome.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you to confer of home affairs.</p>

<p>When you have done, we look to hear from you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>We’ll both attend upon your Ladyship.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sylvia and Thurio exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Now tell me, how do all from whence you came?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Your friends are well and have them much</p>

<p>commended.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>And how do yours?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  I left them all in health.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>How does your lady? And how thrives your love?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>My tales of love were wont to weary you.</p>

<p>I know you joy not in a love discourse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Ay, Proteus, but that life is altered now.</p>

<p>I have done penance for contemning Love,</p>

<p>Whose high imperious thoughts have punished me</p>

<p>With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,</p>

<p>With nightly tears, and daily heartsore sighs,</p>

<p>For in revenge of my contempt of love,</p>

<p>Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes</p>

<p>And made them watchers of mine own heart’s</p>

<p>sorrow.</p>

<p>O gentle Proteus, Love’s a mighty lord</p>

<p>And hath so humbled me as I confess</p>

<p>There is no woe to his correction,</p>

<p>Nor, to his service, no such joy on Earth.</p>

<p>Now, no discourse except it be of love.</p>

<p>Now can I break my fast, dine, sup, and sleep</p>

<p>Upon the very naked name of Love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.</p>

<p>Was this the idol that you worship so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Even she. And is she not a heavenly saint?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>No, but she is an earthly paragon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Call her divine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  I will not flatter her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>O, flatter me, for love delights in praises.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,</p>

<p>And I must minister the like to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,</p>

<p>Yet let her be a principality,</p>

<p>Sovereign to all the creatures on the Earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Except my mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Sweet, except not any,</p>

<p>Except thou wilt except against my love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Have I not reason to prefer mine own?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>And I will help thee to prefer her too:</p>

<p>She shall be dignified with this high honor–</p>

<p>To bear my lady’s train, lest the base earth</p>

<p>Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss</p>

<p>And, of so great a favor growing proud,</p>

<p>Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower</p>

<p>And make rough winter everlastingly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Why, Valentine, what braggartism is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Pardon me, Proteus, all I can is nothing</p>

<p>To her whose worth makes other worthies</p>

<p>nothing.</p>

<p>She is alone–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Then let her alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own,</p>

<p>And I as rich in having such a jewel</p>

<p>As twenty seas if all their sand were pearl,</p>

<p>The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.</p>

<p>Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,</p>

<p>Because thou seest me dote upon my love.</p>

<p>My foolish rival, that her father likes</p>

<p>Only for his possessions are so huge,</p>

<p>Is gone with her along, and I must after,</p>

<p>For love, thou know’st, is full of jealousy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  But she loves you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Ay, and we are betrothed; nay more, our marriage</p>

<p>hour,</p>

<p>With all the cunning manner of our flight</p>

<p>Determined of: how I must climb her window,</p>

<p>The ladder made of cords, and all the means</p>

<p>Plotted and ’greed on for my happiness.</p>

<p>Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,</p>

<p>In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Go on before. I shall inquire you forth.</p>

<p>I must unto the road to disembark</p>

<p>Some necessaries that I needs must use,</p>

<p>And then I’ll presently attend you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Will you make haste?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  I will.     <i><i>[Valentine and Speed exit.]</i></i></p>

<p>Even as one heat another heat expels,</p>

<p>Or as one nail by strength drives out another,</p>

<p>So the remembrance of my former love</p>

<p>Is by a newer object quite forgotten.</p>

<p>Is it mine eye, or Valentine’s praise,</p>

<p>Her true perfection, or my false transgression,</p>

<p>That makes me reasonless to reason thus?</p>

<p>She is fair, and so is Julia that I love–</p>

<p>That I did love, for now my love is thawed,</p>

<p>Which like a waxen image ’gainst a fire</p>

<p>Bears no impression of the thing it was.</p>

<p>Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,</p>

<p>And that I love him not as I was wont.</p>

<p>O, but I love his lady too too much,</p>

<p>And that’s the reason I love him so little.</p>

<p>How shall I dote on her with more advice</p>

<p>That thus without advice begin to love her?</p>

<p>’Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,</p>

<p>And that hath dazzled my reason’s light;</p>

<p>But when I look on her perfections,</p>

<p>There is no reason but I shall be blind.</p>

<p>If I can check my erring love, I will;</p>

<p>If not, to compass her I’ll use my skill.</p>
