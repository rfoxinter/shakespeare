<p><center><i>[Enter Duke, Thurio, and Proteus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;</p>

<p>We have some secrets to confer about.     <i><i>[Thurio exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Now tell me, Proteus, what’s your will with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>My gracious lord, that which I would discover</p>

<p>The law of friendship bids me to conceal,</p>

<p>But when I call to mind your gracious favors</p>

<p>Done to me, undeserving as I am,</p>

<p>My duty pricks me on to utter that</p>

<p>Which else no worldly good should draw from me.</p>

<p>Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine my friend</p>

<p>This night intends to steal away your daughter;</p>

<p>Myself am one made privy to the plot.</p>

<p>I know you have determined to bestow her</p>

<p>On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,</p>

<p>And should she thus be stol’n away from you,</p>

<p>It would be much vexation to your age.</p>

<p>Thus, for my duty’s sake, I rather chose</p>

<p>To cross my friend in his intended drift</p>

<p>Than, by concealing it, heap on your head</p>

<p>A pack of sorrows which would press you down,</p>

<p>Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,</p>

<p>Which to requite command me while I live.</p>

<p>This love of theirs myself have often seen,</p>

<p>Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,</p>

<p>And oftentimes have purposed to forbid</p>

<p>Sir Valentine her company and my court.</p>

<p>But fearing lest my jealous aim might err</p>

<p>And so, unworthily, disgrace the man–</p>

<p>A rashness that I ever yet have shunned–</p>

<p>I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find</p>

<p>That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.</p>

<p>And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,</p>

<p>Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,</p>

<p>I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,</p>

<p>The key whereof myself have ever kept,</p>

<p>And thence she cannot be conveyed away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean</p>

<p>How he her chamber-window will ascend</p>

<p>And with a corded ladder fetch her down;</p>

<p>For which the youthful lover now is gone,</p>

<p>And this way comes he with it presently,</p>

<p>Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.</p>

<p>But, good my lord, do it so cunningly</p>

<p>That my discovery be not aimed at;</p>

<p>For love of you, not hate unto my friend,</p>

<p>Hath made me publisher of this pretense.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Upon mine honor, he shall never know</p>

<p>That I had any light from thee of this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Adieu, my lord. Sir Valentine is coming.</p>

<p><center><i>[Proteus exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Valentine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Please it your Grace, there is a messenger</p>

<p>That stays to bear my letters to my friends,</p>

<p>And I am going to deliver them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span>  Be they of much import?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>The tenor of them doth but signify</p>

<p>My health and happy being at your court.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Nay then, no matter. Stay with me awhile;</p>

<p>I am to break with thee of some affairs</p>

<p>That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.</p>

<p>’Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought</p>

<p>To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>I know it well, my lord, and sure the match</p>

<p>Were rich and honorable. Besides, the gentleman</p>

<p>Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities</p>

<p>Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.</p>

<p>Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>No. Trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,</p>

<p>Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,</p>

<p>Neither regarding that she is my child</p>

<p>Nor fearing me as if I were her father;</p>

<p>And may I say to thee, this pride of hers,</p>

<p>Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her,</p>

<p>And where I thought the remnant of mine age</p>

<p>Should have been cherished by her childlike duty,</p>

<p>I now am full resolved to take a wife</p>

<p>And turn her out to who will take her in.</p>

<p>Then let her beauty be her wedding dower,</p>

<p>For me and my possessions she esteems not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>What would your Grace have me to do in this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>There is a lady in Verona here</p>

<p>Whom I affect; but she is nice, and coy,</p>

<p>And nought esteems my aged eloquence.</p>

<p>Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor–</p>

<p>For long agone I have forgot to court;</p>

<p>Besides, the fashion of the time is changed–</p>

<p>How and which way I may bestow myself</p>

<p>To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Win her with gifts if she respect not words;</p>

<p>Dumb jewels often in their silent kind</p>

<p>More than quick words do move a woman’s mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.</p>

<p>Send her another; never give her o’er,</p>

<p>For scorn at first makes after-love the more.</p>

<p>If she do frown, ’tis not in hate of you,</p>

<p>But rather to beget more love in you.</p>

<p>If she do chide, ’tis not to have you gone,</p>

<p>Forwhy the fools are mad if left alone.</p>

<p>Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;</p>

<p>For “get you gone” she doth not mean “away.”</p>

<p>Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;</p>

<p>Though ne’er so black, say they have angels’ faces.</p>

<p>That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man</p>

<p>If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>But she I mean is promised by her friends</p>

<p>Unto a youthful gentleman of worth</p>

<p>And kept severely from resort of men,</p>

<p>That no man hath access by day to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Why, then, I would resort to her by night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Ay, but the doors be locked and keys kept safe,</p>

<p>That no man hath recourse to her by night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>What lets but one may enter at her window?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,</p>

<p>And built so shelving that one cannot climb it</p>

<p>Without apparent hazard of his life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Why, then a ladder quaintly made of cords</p>

<p>To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,</p>

<p>Would serve to scale another Hero’s tower,</p>

<p>So bold Leander would adventure it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,</p>

<p>Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>When would you use it? Pray sir, tell me that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>This very night; for love is like a child</p>

<p>That longs for everything that he can come by.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>By seven o’clock I’ll get you such a ladder.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>But hark thee: I will go to her alone;</p>

<p>How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it</p>

<p>Under a cloak that is of any length.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span>  Then let me see thy cloak;</p>

<p>I’ll get me one of such another length.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?</p>

<p>I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Pulling off the cloak, he reveals</p>

<p>a rope ladder and a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>What letter is this same? What’s here? <i>[(Reads.)]</i> To</p>

<p>Sylvia.</p>

<p>And here an engine fit for my proceeding.</p>

<p>I’ll be so bold to break the seal for once.</p>

<p><center><i>[Reads.]</i></center></p>

<p>     <i>My thoughts do harbor with my Sylvia nightly,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And slaves they are to me that send them flying.</i></p>

<p>     <i>O, could their master come and go as lightly,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Himself would lodge where, senseless, they are</i></p>

<p>   <i>lying.</i></p>

<p>     <i>My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them,</i></p>

<p>        <i>While I, their king, that thither them importune,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest</i></p>

<p>them,</p>

<p>        <i>Because myself do want my servants’ fortune.</i></p>

<p>     <i>I curse myself, for they are sent by me,</i></p>

<p>     <i>That they should harbor where their lord should be.</i></p>

<p>What’s here?</p>

<p><i>[(Reads.)]</i> Sylvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.</p>

<p>’Tis so. And here’s the ladder for the purpose.</p>

<p>Why, Phaeton–for thou art Merops’ son–</p>

<p>Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car</p>

<p>And with thy daring folly burn the world?</p>

<p>Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee?</p>

<p>Go, base intruder, overweening slave,</p>

<p>Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates</p>

<p>And think my patience, more than thy desert,</p>

<p>Is privilege for thy departure hence.</p>

<p>Thank me for this more than for all the favors</p>

<p>Which all too much I have bestowed on thee.</p>

<p>But if thou linger in my territories</p>

<p>Longer than swiftest expedition</p>

<p>Will give thee time to leave our royal court,</p>

<p>By heaven, my wrath shall far exceed the love</p>

<p>I ever bore my daughter or thyself.</p>

<p>Begone. I will not hear thy vain excuse,</p>

<p>But, as thou lov’st thy life, make speed from hence.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>And why not death, rather than living torment?</p>

<p>To die is to be banished from myself,</p>

<p>And Sylvia is myself; banished from her</p>

<p>Is self from self–a deadly banishment.</p>

<p>What light is light if Sylvia be not seen?</p>

<p>What joy is joy if Sylvia be not by–</p>

<p>Unless it be to think that she is by</p>

<p>And feed upon the shadow of perfection?</p>

<p>Except I be by Sylvia in the night,</p>

<p>There is no music in the nightingale.</p>

<p>Unless I look on Sylvia in the day,</p>

<p>There is no day for me to look upon.</p>

<p>She is my essence, and I leave to be</p>

<p>If I be not by her fair influence</p>

<p>Fostered, illumined, cherished, kept alive.</p>

<p>I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom;</p>

<p>Tarry I here, I but attend on death,</p>

<p>But fly I hence, I fly away from life.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Proteus and Lance.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  So-ho, so-ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  What seest thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Him we go to find. There’s not a hair on ’s head</p>

<p>but ’tis a Valentine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Valentine?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Who then? His spirit?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Neither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  What then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Who wouldst thou strike?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  Villain, forbear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Why, sir, I’ll strike nothing. I pray you–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Sirrah, I say forbear.–Friend Valentine, a word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>My ears are stopped and cannot hear good news,</p>

<p>So much of bad already hath possessed them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,</p>

<p>For they are harsh, untunable, and bad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Is Sylvia dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  No, Valentine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>No Valentine indeed for sacred Sylvia.</p>

<p>Hath she forsworn me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span>  No, Valentine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>No Valentine if Sylvia have forsworn me.</p>

<p>What is your news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Sir, there is a proclamation that you are</p>

<p>vanished.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>That thou art banished–O, that’s the news–</p>

<p>From hence, from Sylvia, and from me thy friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>O, I have fed upon this woe already,</p>

<p>And now excess of it will make me surfeit.</p>

<p>Doth Sylvia know that I am banished?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Ay, ay, and she hath offered to the doom–</p>

<p>Which unreversed stands in effectual force–</p>

<p>A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;</p>

<p>Those at her father’s churlish feet she tendered,</p>

<p>With them, upon her knees, her humble self,</p>

<p>Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became</p>

<p>them</p>

<p>As if but now they waxed pale for woe.</p>

<p>But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,</p>

<p>Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears</p>

<p>Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;</p>

<p>But Valentine, if he be ta’en, must die.</p>

<p>Besides, her intercession chafed him so,</p>

<p>When she for thy repeal was suppliant,</p>

<p>That to close prison he commanded her</p>

<p>With many bitter threats of biding there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>No more, unless the next word that thou speak’st</p>

<p>Have some malignant power upon my life.</p>

<p>If so, I pray thee breathe it in mine ear</p>

<p>As ending anthem of my endless dolor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,</p>

<p>And study help for that which thou lament’st.</p>

<p>Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.</p>

<p>Here, if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;</p>

<p>Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.</p>

<p>Hope is a lover’s staff; walk hence with that</p>

<p>And manage it against despairing thoughts.</p>

<p>Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,</p>

<p>Which, being writ to me, shall be delivered</p>

<p>Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.</p>

<p>The time now serves not to expostulate.</p>

<p>Come, I’ll convey thee through the city gate</p>

<p>And, ere I part with thee, confer at large</p>

<p>Of all that may concern thy love affairs.</p>

<p>As thou lov’st Sylvia, though not for thyself,</p>

<p>Regard thy danger, and along with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>I pray thee, Lance, an if thou seest my boy,</p>

<p>Bid him make haste and meet me at the North</p>

<p>Gate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Proteus</span></p>

<p>Go, sirrah, find him out.–Come, Valentine.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  O villain, that set this down among her vices! To</p>

<p>be slow in words is a woman’s only virtue. I pray</p>

<p>thee, out with ’t, and place it for her chief virtue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Item, She is proud.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Out with that too; it was Eve’s legacy and</p>

<p>cannot be ta’en from her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Item, She hath no teeth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Item, She is curst.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Item, She will often praise her liquor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  If her liquor be good, she shall; if she will not, I</p>

<p>will, for good things should be praised.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Item, She is too liberal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Of her tongue she cannot, for that’s writ down</p>

<p>she is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that I’ll</p>

<p>keep shut; now, of another thing she may, and that</p>

<p>cannot I help. Well, proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Item, She hath more hair than wit, and more</p>

<p>faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Stop there. I’ll have her. She was mine and not</p>

<p>mine twice or thrice in that last article. Rehearse</p>

<p>that once more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Item, She hath more hair than wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  “More hair than wit”? It may be; I’ll prove it:</p>

<p>the cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it is</p>

<p>more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit is</p>

<p>more than the wit, for the greater hides the less.</p>

<p>What’s next?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  And more faults than hairs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  That’s monstrous! O, that that were out!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  And more wealth than faults.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well,</p>

<p>I’ll have her, and if it be a match, as nothing is</p>

<p>impossible–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  What then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Why, then will I tell thee that thy master stays</p>

<p>for thee at the North Gate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  For me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  For thee? Ay, who art thou? He hath stayed for a</p>

<p>better man than thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  And must I go to him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so</p>

<p>long that going will scarce serve the turn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span> <i>[handing him the paper]</i>  Why didst not tell me</p>

<p>sooner? Pox of your love letters!     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Now will he be swinged for reading my letter;</p>

<p>an unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into</p>

<p>secrets. I’ll after, to rejoice in the boy’s correction.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
