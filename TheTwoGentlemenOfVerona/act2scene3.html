<p><center><i>[Enter Lance, weeping, with his dog, Crab.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Nay,’twill be this hour ere I have done weeping.</p>

<p>All the kind of the Lances have this very fault. I have</p>

<p>received my proportion like the Prodigious Son and</p>

<p>am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial’s court. I</p>

<p>think Crab my dog be the sourest-natured dog that</p>

<p>lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my</p>

<p>sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing</p>

<p>her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity,</p>

<p>yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He</p>

<p>is a stone, a very pibble stone, and has no more pity</p>

<p>in him than a dog. A Jew would have wept to have</p>

<p>seen our parting. Why, my grandam, having no</p>

<p>eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting.</p>

<p>Nay, I’ll show you the manner of it. <i>[He takes off his</p>

<p>shoes.]</i> This shoe is my father. No, this left shoe is</p>

<p>my father; no, no, this left shoe is my mother. Nay,</p>

<p>that cannot be so neither. Yes, it is so, it is so; it hath</p>

<p>the worser sole. This shoe with the hole in it is my</p>

<p>mother; and this my father. A vengeance on ’t, there</p>

<p>’tis! Now sir, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she</p>

<p>is as white as a lily and as small as a wand. This hat</p>

<p>is Nan, our maid. I am the dog. No, the dog is</p>

<p>himself, and I am the dog. O, the dog is me, and I</p>

<p>am myself. Ay, so, so. Now come I to my father:</p>

<p>“Father, your blessing.” Now should not the shoe</p>

<p>speak a word for weeping. Now should I kiss my</p>

<p>father. <i>[He kisses one shoe.]</i> Well, he weeps on. Now</p>

<p>come I to my mother. O, that she could speak now</p>

<p>like a wold woman! Well, I kiss her. <i>[He kisses the</p>

<p>other shoe.]</i> Why, there ’tis; here’s my mother’s</p>

<p>breath up and down. Now come I to my sister. Mark</p>

<p>the moan she makes! Now the dog all this while</p>

<p>sheds not a tear nor speaks a word. But see how I</p>

<p>lay the dust with my tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pantino.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pantino</span>  Lance, away, away! Aboard. Thy master is</p>

<p>shipped, and thou art to post after with oars. What’s</p>

<p>the matter? Why weep’st thou, man? Away, ass.</p>

<p>You’ll lose the tide if you tarry any longer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  It is no matter if the tied were lost, for it is the</p>

<p>unkindest tied that ever any man tied.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pantino</span>  What’s the unkindest tide?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Why, he that’s tied here, Crab my dog.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pantino</span>  Tut, man. I mean thou ’lt lose the flood and, in</p>

<p>losing the flood, lose thy voyage and, in losing thy</p>

<p>voyage, lose thy master and, in losing thy master,</p>

<p>lose thy service and, in losing thy service–<i>[Lance</p>

<p>covers Pantino’s mouth.]</i> Why dost thou stop my</p>

<p>mouth?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pantino</span>  Where should I lose my tongue?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  In thy tale.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pantino</span>  In thy tail!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master,</p>

<p>and the service, and the tied. Why, man, if the river</p>

<p>were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the</p>

<p>wind were down, I could drive the boat with my</p>

<p>sighs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pantino</span>  Come. Come away, man. I was sent to call</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Sir, call me what thou dar’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pantino</span>  Wilt thou go?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lance</span>  Well, I will go.</p>
