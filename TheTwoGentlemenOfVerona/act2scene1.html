<p><center><i>[Enter Valentine and Speed, carrying a glove.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span></p>

<p>Sir, your glove.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Not mine. My gloves are on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span></p>

<p>Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Ha? Let me see. Ay, give it me, it’s mine.</p>

<p>Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!</p>

<p>Ah, Sylvia, Sylvia!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span> <i>[calling]</i>  Madam Sylvia! Madam Sylvia!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  How now, sirrah?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  She is not within hearing, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Why, sir, who bade you call her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Your Worship, sir, or else I mistook.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Well, you’ll still be too forward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Go to, sir. Tell me, do you know Madam</p>

<p>Sylvia?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  She that your Worship loves?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Why, how know you that I am in love?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Marry, by these special marks: first, you have</p>

<p>learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms like</p>

<p>a malcontent; to relish a love song like a robin</p>

<p>redbreast; to walk alone like one that had the</p>

<p>pestilence; to sigh like a schoolboy that had lost his</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Abc</span>; to weep like a young wench that had buried</p>

<p>her grandam; to fast like one that takes diet; to</p>

<p>watch like one that fears robbing; to speak puling</p>

<p>like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when</p>

<p>you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walked,</p>

<p>to walk like one of the lions. When you fasted, it was</p>

<p>presently after dinner; when you looked sadly, it</p>

<p>was for want of money. And now you are metamorphosed</p>

<p>with a mistress, that when I look on you, I</p>

<p>can hardly think you my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Are all these things perceived in me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  They are all perceived without you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Without me? They cannot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Without you? Nay, that’s certain, for without</p>

<p>you were so simple, none else would. But you are so</p>

<p>without these follies, that these follies are within</p>

<p>you and shine through you like the water in an</p>

<p>urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a</p>

<p>physician to comment on your malady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  But tell me, dost thou know my Lady</p>

<p>Sylvia?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Hast thou observed that? Even she I mean.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Why, sir, I know her not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Dost thou know her by my gazing on her</p>

<p>and yet know’st her not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Is she not hard-favored, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Not so fair, boy, as well-favored.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Sir, I know that well enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  What dost thou know?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favored.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  I mean that her beauty is exquisite but her</p>

<p>favor infinite.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  That’s because the one is painted, and the other</p>

<p>out of all count.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  How painted? And how out of count?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Marry, sir, so painted to make her fair, that no</p>

<p>man counts of her beauty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  How esteem’st thou me? I account of her</p>

<p>beauty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  You never saw her since she was deformed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  How long hath she been deformed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Ever since you loved her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  I have loved her ever since I saw her, and</p>

<p>still I see her beautiful.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  If you love her, you cannot see her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Why?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Because love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes,</p>

<p>or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to</p>

<p>have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going</p>

<p>ungartered!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  What should I see then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Your own present folly and her passing deformity;</p>

<p>for he, being in love, could not see to garter his</p>

<p>hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on</p>

<p>your hose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Belike, boy, then you are in love, for last</p>

<p>morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  True, sir, I was in love with my bed. I thank you,</p>

<p>you swinged me for my love, which makes me the</p>

<p>bolder to chide you for yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  In conclusion, I stand affected to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  I would you were set, so your affection would</p>

<p>cease.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Last night she enjoined me to write some</p>

<p>lines to one she loves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  And have you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  I have.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Are they not lamely writ?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  No, boy, but as well as I can do them.</p>

<p>Peace, here she comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sylvia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span> <i>[aside]</i>  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!</p>

<p>Now will he interpret to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Madam and mistress, a thousand</p>

<p>good-morrows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span> <i>[aside]</i>  O, give ye good ev’n! Here’s a million of</p>

<p>manners.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span>  Sir Valentine, and servant, to you two</p>

<p>thousand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span> <i>[aside]</i>  He should give her interest, and she</p>

<p>gives it him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>As you enjoined me, I have writ your letter</p>

<p>Unto the secret, nameless friend of yours,</p>

<p>Which I was much unwilling to proceed in</p>

<p>But for my duty to your Ladyship.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives her a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>I thank you, gentle servant, ’tis very clerkly done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off,</p>

<p>For, being ignorant to whom it goes,</p>

<p>I writ at random, very doubtfully.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>Perchance you think too much of so much pains?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>No, madam. So it stead you, I will write,</p>

<p>Please you command, a thousand times as much,</p>

<p>And yet–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>A pretty period. Well, I guess the sequel;</p>

<p>And yet I will not name it And yet I care not.</p>

<p>And yet take this again.     <i><i>[She holds out the paper.]</i></i></p>

<p>And yet I thank you,</p>

<p>Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>And yet you will; and yet another “yet.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span></p>

<p>What means your Ladyship? Do you not like it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes, the lines are very quaintly writ,</p>

<p>But, since unwillingly, take them again.</p>

<p>Nay, take them.     <i><i>[She again offers him the paper.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Madam, they are for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>Ay, ay. You writ them, sir, at my request,</p>

<p>But I will none of them. They are for you.</p>

<p>I would have had them writ more movingly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span> <i>[taking the paper]</i></p>

<p>Please you, I’ll write your Ladyship another.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>And when it’s writ, for my sake read it over,</p>

<p>And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  If it please me, madam? What then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sylvia</span></p>

<p>Why, if it please you, take it for your labor.</p>

<p>And so good-morrow, servant.     <i><i>[Sylvia exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible</p>

<p>As a nose on a man’s face, or a weathercock on a</p>

<p>steeple!</p>

<p>My master sues to her, and she hath taught her</p>

<p>suitor,</p>

<p>He being her pupil, to become her tutor.</p>

<p>O excellent device! Was there ever heard a better?</p>

<p>That my master, being scribe, to himself should</p>

<p>write the letter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  How now, sir? What, are you reasoning</p>

<p>with yourself?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Nay, I was rhyming. ’Tis you that have the</p>

<p>reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  To do what?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  To be a spokesman from Madam Sylvia.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  To whom?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  To yourself. Why, she woos you by a figure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  What figure?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  By a letter, I should say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  Why, she hath not writ to me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  What need she when she hath made you write</p>

<p>to yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  No, believe me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive</p>

<p>her earnest?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  She gave me none, except an angry word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Why, she hath given you a letter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  That’s the letter I writ to her friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  And that letter hath she delivered, and there an</p>

<p>end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  I would it were no worse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  I’ll warrant you, ’tis as well.</p>

<p>For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty</p>

<p>Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply,</p>

<p>Or fearing else some messenger that might her</p>

<p>mind discover,</p>

<p>Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto</p>

<p>her lover.</p>

<p>All this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why</p>

<p>muse you, sir? ’Tis dinnertime.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valentine</span>  I have dined.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Speed</span>  Ay, but hearken, sir, though the chameleon love</p>

<p>can feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by</p>

<p>my victuals and would fain have meat. O, be not like</p>

<p>your mistress! Be moved, be moved.</p>
