<p><center><i>[Enter Julia and Lucetta.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span></p>

<p>Counsel, Lucetta. Gentle girl, assist me;</p>

<p>And ev’n in kind love I do conjure thee–</p>

<p>Who art the table wherein all my thoughts</p>

<p>Are visibly charactered and engraved–</p>

<p>To lesson me and tell me some good mean</p>

<p>How with my honor I may undertake</p>

<p>A journey to my loving Proteus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucetta</span></p>

<p>Alas, the way is wearisome and long.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span></p>

<p>A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary</p>

<p>To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;</p>

<p>Much less shall she that hath Love’s wings to fly,</p>

<p>And when the flight is made to one so dear,</p>

<p>Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucetta</span></p>

<p>Better forbear till Proteus make return.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span></p>

<p>O, know’st thou not his looks are my soul’s food?</p>

<p>Pity the dearth that I have pined in</p>

<p>By longing for that food so long a time.</p>

<p>Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,</p>

<p>Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow</p>

<p>As seek to quench the fire of love with words.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucetta</span></p>

<p>I do not seek to quench your love’s hot fire,</p>

<p>But qualify the fire’s extreme rage,</p>

<p>Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span></p>

<p>The more thou damm’st it up, the more it burns.</p>

<p>The current that with gentle murmur glides,</p>

<p>Thou know’st, being stopped, impatiently doth rage,</p>

<p>But when his fair course is not hindered,</p>

<p>He makes sweet music with th’ enameled stones,</p>

<p>Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge</p>

<p>He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;</p>

<p>And so by many winding nooks he strays</p>

<p>With willing sport to the wild ocean.</p>

<p>Then let me go and hinder not my course.</p>

<p>I’ll be as patient as a gentle stream</p>

<p>And make a pastime of each weary step</p>

<p>Till the last step have brought me to my love,</p>

<p>And there I’ll rest as after much turmoil</p>

<p>A blessed soul doth in Elysium.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucetta</span></p>

<p>But in what habit will you go along?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span></p>

<p>Not like a woman, for I would prevent</p>

<p>The loose encounters of lascivious men.</p>

<p>Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds</p>

<p>As may beseem some well-reputed page.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucetta</span></p>

<p>Why, then, your Ladyship must cut your hair.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span></p>

<p>No, girl, I’ll knit it up in silken strings</p>

<p>With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.</p>

<p>To be fantastic may become a youth</p>

<p>Of greater time than I shall show to be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucetta</span></p>

<p>What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span></p>

<p>That fits as well as “Tell me, good my lord,</p>

<p>What compass will you wear your farthingale?”</p>

<p>Why, ev’n what fashion thou best likes, Lucetta.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucetta</span></p>

<p>You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span></p>

<p>Out, out, Lucetta. That will be ill-favored.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucetta</span></p>

<p>A round hose, madam, now’s not worth a pin</p>

<p>Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span></p>

<p>Lucetta, as thou lov’st me, let me have</p>

<p>What thou think’st meet and is most mannerly.</p>

<p>But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me</p>

<p>For undertaking so unstaid a journey?</p>

<p>I fear me it will make me scandalized.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucetta</span></p>

<p>If you think so, then stay at home and go not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span>  Nay, that I will not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucetta</span></p>

<p>Then never dream on infamy, but go.</p>

<p>If Proteus like your journey when you come,</p>

<p>No matter who’s displeased when you are gone.</p>

<p>I fear me he will scarce be pleased withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span></p>

<p>That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear.</p>

<p>A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,</p>

<p>And instances of infinite of love</p>

<p>Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucetta</span></p>

<p>All these are servants to deceitful men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span></p>

<p>Base men that use them to so base effect!</p>

<p>But truer stars did govern Proteus’ birth.</p>

<p>His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,</p>

<p>His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,</p>

<p>His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,</p>

<p>His heart as far from fraud as heaven from Earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucetta</span></p>

<p>Pray heav’n he prove so when you come to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Julia</span></p>

<p>Now, as thou lov’st me, do him not that wrong</p>

<p>To bear a hard opinion of his truth.</p>

<p>Only deserve my love by loving him.</p>

<p>And presently go with me to my chamber</p>

<p>To take a note of what I stand in need of</p>

<p>To furnish me upon my longing journey.</p>

<p>All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,</p>

<p>My goods, my lands, my reputation.</p>

<p>Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.</p>

<p>Come, answer not, but to it presently.</p>

<p>I am impatient of my tarriance.</p>
