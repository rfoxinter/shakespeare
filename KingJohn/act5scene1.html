<p><center><i>[Enter King John and Pandulph with the crown, and</p>

<p>their Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Thus have I yielded up into your hand</p>

<p>The circle of my glory.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc> <i>[handing John the crown]</i>  Take again</p>

<p>From this my hand, as holding of the Pope,</p>

<p>Your sovereign greatness and authority.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Now keep your holy word. Go meet the French,</p>

<p>And from his Holiness use all your power</p>

<p>To stop their marches ’fore we are inflamed.</p>

<p>Our discontented counties do revolt,</p>

<p>Our people quarrel with obedience,</p>

<p>Swearing allegiance and the love of soul</p>

<p>To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.</p>

<p>This inundation of mistempered humor</p>

<p>Rests by you only to be qualified.</p>

<p>Then pause not, for the present time’s so sick</p>

<p>That present med’cine must be ministered,</p>

<p>Or overthrow incurable ensues.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>It was my breath that blew this tempest up,</p>

<p>Upon your stubborn usage of the Pope;</p>

<p>But since you are a gentle convertite,</p>

<p>My tongue shall hush again this storm of war</p>

<p>And make fair weather in your blust’ring land.</p>

<p>On this Ascension Day, remember well:</p>

<p>Upon your oath of service to the Pope,</p>

<p>Go I to make the French lay down their arms.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Is this Ascension Day? Did not the prophet</p>

<p>Say that before Ascension Day at noon</p>

<p>My crown I should give off? Even so I have.</p>

<p>I did suppose it should be on constraint,</p>

<p>But, God be thanked, it is but voluntary.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bastard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>All Kent hath yielded. Nothing there holds out</p>

<p>But Dover Castle. London hath received</p>

<p>Like a kind host the Dauphin and his powers.</p>

<p>Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone</p>

<p>To offer service to your enemy;</p>

<p>And wild amazement hurries up and down</p>

<p>The little number of your doubtful friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Would not my lords return to me again</p>

<p>After they heard young Arthur was alive?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>They found him dead and cast into the streets,</p>

<p>An empty casket where the jewel of life</p>

<p>By some damned hand was robbed and ta’en away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>That villain Hubert told me he did live!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.</p>

<p>But wherefore do you droop? Why look you sad?</p>

<p>Be great in act, as you have been in thought.</p>

<p>Let not the world see fear and sad distrust</p>

<p>Govern the motion of a kingly eye.</p>

<p>Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;</p>

<p>Threaten the threat’ner, and outface the brow</p>

<p>Of bragging horror. So shall inferior eyes,</p>

<p>That borrow their behaviors from the great,</p>

<p>Grow great by your example and put on</p>

<p>The dauntless spirit of resolution.</p>

<p>Away, and glister like the god of war</p>

<p>When he intendeth to become the field.</p>

<p>Show boldness and aspiring confidence.</p>

<p>What, shall they seek the lion in his den</p>

<p>And fright him there? And make him tremble there?</p>

<p>O, let it not be said! Forage, and run</p>

<p>To meet displeasure farther from the doors,</p>

<p>And grapple with him ere he come so nigh.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>The legate of the Pope hath been with me,</p>

<p>And I have made a happy peace with him,</p>

<p>And he hath promised to dismiss the powers</p>

<p>Led by the Dauphin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc>  O inglorious league!</p>

<p>Shall we upon the footing of our land</p>

<p>Send fair-play orders and make compromise,</p>

<p>Insinuation, parley, and base truce</p>

<p>To arms invasive? Shall a beardless boy,</p>

<p>A cockered silken wanton, brave our fields</p>

<p>And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,</p>

<p>Mocking the air with colors idly spread,</p>

<p>And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms!</p>

<p>Perchance the Cardinal cannot make your peace;</p>

<p>Or if he do, let it at least be said</p>

<p>They saw we had a purpose of defense.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Have thou the ordering of this present time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>Away, then, with good courage! <i>[(Aside.)]</i> Yet I</p>

<p>know</p>

<p>Our party may well meet a prouder foe.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
