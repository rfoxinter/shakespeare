<p><center><i>[Enter King John, Queen Eleanor, Pembroke, Essex, and</p>

<p>Salisbury, with the Chatillion of France.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>Now say, Chatillion, what would France with us?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chatillion</span></p>

<p>Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France</p>

<p>In my behavior to the majesty,</p>

<p>The borrowed majesty, of England here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Eleanor</span></p>

<p>A strange beginning: “borrowed majesty”!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>Silence, good mother. Hear the embassy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chatillion</span></p>

<p>Philip of France, in right and true behalf</p>

<p>Of thy deceased brother Geoffrey’s son,</p>

<p>Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim</p>

<p>To this fair island and the territories,</p>

<p>To Ireland, Poitiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,</p>

<p>Desiring thee to lay aside the sword</p>

<p>Which sways usurpingly these several titles,</p>

<p>And put the same into young Arthur’s hand,</p>

<p>Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>What follows if we disallow of this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chatillion</span></p>

<p>The proud control of fierce and bloody war,</p>

<p>To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>Here have we war for war and blood for blood,</p>

<p>Controlment for controlment: so answer France.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Chatillion</span></p>

<p>Then take my king’s defiance from my mouth,</p>

<p>The farthest limit of my embassy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace.</p>

<p>Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France,</p>

<p>For ere thou canst report, I will be there;</p>

<p>The thunder of my cannon shall be heard.</p>

<p>So, hence. Be thou the trumpet of our wrath</p>

<p>And sullen presage of your own decay.–</p>

<p>An honorable conduct let him have.</p>

<p>Pembroke, look to ’t.–Farewell, Chatillion.</p>

<p><center><i>[Chatillion and Pembroke exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Eleanor</span> <i>[aside to King John]</i></p>

<p>What now, my son! Have I not ever said</p>

<p>How that ambitious Constance would not cease</p>

<p>Till she had kindled France and all the world</p>

<p>Upon the right and party of her son?</p>

<p>This might have been prevented and made whole</p>

<p>With very easy arguments of love,</p>

<p>Which now the manage of two kingdoms must</p>

<p>With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span> <i>[aside to Queen Eleanor]</i></p>

<p>Our strong possession and our right for us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Eleanor</span> <i>[aside to King John]</i></p>

<p>Your strong possession much more than your right,</p>

<p>Or else it must go wrong with you and me–</p>

<p>So much my conscience whispers in your ear,</p>

<p>Which none but God and you and I shall hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Sheriff, who speaks aside to Essex.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Essex</span></p>

<p>My liege, here is the strangest controversy</p>

<p>Come from the country to be judged by you</p>

<p>That e’er I heard. Shall I produce the men?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  Let them approach.     <i><i>[Sheriff exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Our abbeys and our priories shall pay</p>

<p>This expedition’s charge.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robert Faulconbridge and Philip Faulconbridge.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What men are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philip</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>Your faithful subject I, a gentleman,</p>

<p>Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,</p>

<p>As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,</p>

<p>A soldier, by the honor-giving hand</p>

<p>Of Coeur de Lion knighted in the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span> <i>[to Robert Faulconbridge]</i>  What art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Robert</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?</p>

<p>You came not of one mother then, it seems.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philip</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>Most certain of one mother, mighty king–</p>

<p>That is well known–and, as I think, one father.</p>

<p>But for the certain knowledge of that truth</p>

<p>I put you o’er to heaven and to my mother.</p>

<p>Of that I doubt, as all men’s children may.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Eleanor</span></p>

<p>Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy</p>

<p>mother</p>

<p>And wound her honor with this diffidence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philip</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>I, madam? No, I have no reason for it.</p>

<p>That is my brother’s plea, and none of mine,</p>

<p>The which if he can prove, he pops me out</p>

<p>At least from fair five hundred pound a year.</p>

<p>Heaven guard my mother’s honor and my land!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>A good blunt fellow.–Why, being younger born,</p>

<p>Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philip</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>I know not why, except to get the land.</p>

<p>But once he slandered me with bastardy.</p>

<p>But whe’er I be as true begot or no,</p>

<p>That still I lay upon my mother’s head.</p>

<p>But that I am as well begot, my liege–</p>

<p>Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!–</p>

<p>Compare our faces and be judge yourself.</p>

<p>If old Sir Robert did beget us both</p>

<p>And were our father, and this son like him,</p>

<p>O, old Sir Robert, father, on my knee</p>

<p>I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Eleanor</span> <i>[aside to King John]</i></p>

<p>He hath a trick of Coeur de Lion’s face;</p>

<p>The accent of his tongue affecteth him.</p>

<p>Do you not read some tokens of my son</p>

<p>In the large composition of this man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span> <i>[aside to Queen Eleanor]</i></p>

<p>Mine eye hath well examined his parts</p>

<p>And finds them perfect Richard. <i>[To Robert</p>

<p>Faulconbridge]</i> Sirrah, speak.</p>

<p>What doth move you to claim your brother’s land?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philip</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>Because he hath a half-face, like my father.</p>

<p>With half that face would he have all my land–</p>

<p>A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Robert</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>My gracious liege, when that my father lived,</p>

<p>Your brother did employ my father much–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philip</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land.</p>

<p>Your tale must be how he employed my mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Robert</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>And once dispatched him in an embassy</p>

<p>To Germany, there with the Emperor</p>

<p>To treat of high affairs touching that time.</p>

<p>Th’ advantage of his absence took the King</p>

<p>And in the meantime sojourned at my father’s;</p>

<p>Where how he did prevail I shame to speak.</p>

<p>But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores</p>

<p>Between my father and my mother lay,</p>

<p>As I have heard my father speak himself,</p>

<p>When this same lusty gentleman was got.</p>

<p>Upon his deathbed he by will bequeathed</p>

<p>His lands to me, and took it on his death</p>

<p>That this my mother’s son was none of his;</p>

<p>An if he were, he came into the world</p>

<p>Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.</p>

<p>Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,</p>

<p>My father’s land, as was my father’s will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>Sirrah, your brother is legitimate.</p>

<p>Your father’s wife did after wedlock bear him,</p>

<p>An if she did play false, the fault was hers,</p>

<p>Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands</p>

<p>That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,</p>

<p>Who as you say took pains to get this son,</p>

<p>Had of your father claimed this son for his?</p>

<p>In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept</p>

<p>This calf, bred from his cow, from all the world;</p>

<p>In sooth he might. Then if he were my brother’s,</p>

<p>My brother might not claim him, nor your father,</p>

<p>Being none of his, refuse him. This concludes:</p>

<p>My mother’s son did get your father’s heir;</p>

<p>Your father’s heir must have your father’s land.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Robert</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>Shall then my father’s will be of no force</p>

<p>To dispossess that child which is not his?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philip</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,</p>

<p>Than was his will to get me, as I think.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Eleanor</span></p>

<p>Whether hadst thou rather: be a Faulconbridge</p>

<p>And, like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,</p>

<p>Or the reputed son of Coeur de Lion,</p>

<p>Lord of thy presence, and no land besides?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Madam, an if my brother had my shape</p>

<p>And I had his, Sir Robert’s his like him,</p>

<p>And if my legs were two such riding-rods,</p>

<p>My arms such eel-skins stuffed, my face so thin</p>

<p>That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose,</p>

<p>Lest men should say “Look where three-farthings</p>

<p>goes,”</p>

<p>And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,</p>

<p>Would I might never stir from off this place,</p>

<p>I would give it every foot to have this face.</p>

<p>I would not be Sir Nob in any case.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Eleanor</span></p>

<p>I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,</p>

<p>Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me?</p>

<p>I am a soldier and now bound to France.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Brother, take you my land. I’ll take my chance.</p>

<p>Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,</p>

<p>Yet sell your face for five pence and ’tis dear.–</p>

<p>Madam, I’ll follow you unto the death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Eleanor</span></p>

<p>Nay, I would have you go before me thither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Our country manners give our betters way.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  What is thy name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,</p>

<p>Philip, good old Sir Robert’s wife’s eldest son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>From henceforth bear his name whose form thou</p>

<p>bearest.</p>

<p>Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great.</p>

<p><center><i>[Philip kneels. King John dubs him a knight,</p>

<p>tapping him on the shoulder with his sword.]</i></center></p>

<p>Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span> <i>[rising, to Robert Faulconbridge]</i></p>

<p>Brother by th’ mother’s side, give me your hand.</p>

<p>My father gave me honor, yours gave land.</p>

<p>Now blessed be the hour, by night or day,</p>

<p>When I was got, Sir Robert was away!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Eleanor</span></p>

<p>The very spirit of Plantagenet!</p>

<p>I am thy grandam, Richard. Call me so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Madam, by chance but not by truth. What though?</p>

<p>Something about, a little from the right,</p>

<p>   <i>In at the window, or else o’er the hatch.</i></p>

<p>Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,</p>

<p>   <i>And have is have, however men do catch.</i></p>

<p>Near or far off, well won is still well shot,</p>

<p>And I am I, howe’er I was begot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span> <i>[to Robert Faulconbridge]</i></p>

<p>Go, Faulconbridge, now hast thou thy desire.</p>

<p>A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.–</p>

<p>Come, madam,–and come, Richard. We must</p>

<p>speed</p>

<p>For France, for France, for it is more than need.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Brother, adieu, good fortune come to thee,</p>

<p>For thou wast got i’ th’ way of honesty.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Bastard exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>A foot of honor better than I was,</p>

<p>But many a many foot of land the worse.</p>

<p>Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.</p>

<p>“Good den, Sir Richard!” “God-a-mercy, fellow!”</p>

<p>An if his name be George, I’ll call him “Peter,”</p>

<p>For new-made honor doth forget men’s names;</p>

<p>’Tis too respective and too sociable</p>

<p>For your conversion. Now your traveler,</p>

<p>He and his toothpick at my Worship’s mess,</p>

<p>And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,</p>

<p>Why then I suck my teeth and catechize</p>

<p>My picked man of countries: “My dear sir,”</p>

<p>Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin,</p>

<p>“I shall beseech you”–that is Question now,</p>

<p>And then comes Answer like an absey-book:</p>

<p>“O, sir,” says Answer, “at your best command,</p>

<p>At your employment, at your service, sir.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” says Question, “I, sweet sir, at yours.”</p>

<p>And so, ere Answer knows what Question would,</p>

<p>Saving in dialogue of compliment</p>

<p>And talking of the Alps and Apennines,</p>

<p>The Pyrenean and the river Po,</p>

<p>It draws toward supper in conclusion so.</p>

<p>But this is worshipful society</p>

<p>And fits the mounting spirit like myself;</p>

<p>For he is but a bastard to the time</p>

<p>That doth not smack of observation,</p>

<p>And so am I whether I smack or no;</p>

<p>And not alone in habit and device,</p>

<p>Exterior form, outward accouterment,</p>

<p>But from the inward motion to deliver</p>

<p>Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age’s tooth,</p>

<p>Which though I will not practice to deceive,</p>

<p>Yet to avoid deceit I mean to learn,</p>

<p>For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lady Faulconbridge and James Gurney.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But who comes in such haste in riding robes?</p>

<p>What woman post is this? Hath she no husband</p>

<p>That will take pains to blow a horn before her?</p>

<p>O me, ’tis my mother.–How now, good lady?</p>

<p>What brings you here to court so hastily?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>Where is that slave thy brother? Where is he</p>

<p>That holds in chase mine honor up and down?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>My brother Robert, old Sir Robert’s son?</p>

<p>Colbrand the Giant, that same mighty man?</p>

<p>Is it Sir Robert’s son that you seek so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>“Sir Robert’s son”? Ay, thou unreverent boy,</p>

<p>Sir Robert’s son. Why scorn’st thou at Sir Robert?</p>

<p>He is Sir Robert’s son, and so art thou.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gurney</span></p>

<p>Good leave, good Philip.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span>  “Philip Sparrow,” James.</p>

<p>There’s toys abroad. Anon I’ll tell thee more.</p>

<p><center><i>[James Gurney exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Madam, I was not old Sir Robert’s son.</p>

<p>Sir Robert might have eat his part in me</p>

<p>Upon Good Friday and ne’er broke his fast.</p>

<p>Sir Robert could do well–marry, to confess–</p>

<p>Could he get me. Sir Robert could not do it;</p>

<p>We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,</p>

<p>To whom am I beholding for these limbs?</p>

<p>Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,</p>

<p>That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine</p>

<p>honor?</p>

<p>What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.</p>

<p>What, I am dubbed! I have it on my shoulder.</p>

<p>But, mother, I am not Sir Robert’s son.</p>

<p>I have disclaimed Sir Robert and my land.</p>

<p>Legitimation, name, and all is gone.</p>

<p>Then, good my mother, let me know my father–</p>

<p>Some proper man, I hope. Who was it, mother?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>As faithfully as I deny the devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Faulconbridge</span></p>

<p>King Richard Coeur de Lion was thy father.</p>

<p>By long and vehement suit I was seduced</p>

<p>To make room for him in my husband’s bed.</p>

<p>Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!</p>

<p>Thou art the issue of my dear offense,</p>

<p>Which was so strongly urged past my defense.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Now, by this light, were I to get again,</p>

<p>Madam, I would not wish a better father.</p>

<p>Some sins do bear their privilege on Earth,</p>

<p>And so doth yours. Your fault was not your folly.</p>

<p>Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,</p>

<p>Subjected tribute to commanding love,</p>

<p>Against whose fury and unmatched force</p>

<p>The aweless lion could not wage the fight,</p>

<p>Nor keep his princely heart from Richard’s hand.</p>

<p>He that perforce robs lions of their hearts</p>

<p>May easily win a woman’s. Ay, my mother,</p>

<p>With all my heart I thank thee for my father.</p>

<p>Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well</p>

<p>When I was got, I’ll send his soul to hell.</p>

<p>Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin,</p>

<p>   <i>And they shall say when Richard me begot,</i></p>

<p>If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin.</p>

<p>   <i>Who says it was, he lies. I say ’twas not.</i></p>
