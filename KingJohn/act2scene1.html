<p><center><i>[Enter, before Angiers, at one side, with Forces, Philip</p>

<p>King of France, Louis the Dauphin, Constance, Arthur,</p>

<p>and Attendants; at the other side, with Forces, Austria,</p>

<p>wearing a lion’s skin.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.–</p>

<p>Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,</p>

<p>Richard, that robbed the lion of his heart</p>

<p>And fought the holy wars in Palestine,</p>

<p>By this brave duke came early to his grave.</p>

<p>And, for amends to his posterity,</p>

<p>At our importance hither is he come</p>

<p>To spread his colors, boy, in thy behalf,</p>

<p>And to rebuke the usurpation</p>

<p>Of thy unnatural uncle, English John.</p>

<p>Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arthur</sc></p>

<p>God shall forgive you Coeur de Lion’s death</p>

<p>The rather that you give his offspring life,</p>

<p>Shadowing their right under your wings of war.</p>

<p>I give you welcome with a powerless hand</p>

<p>But with a heart full of unstained love.</p>

<p>Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>A noble boy. Who would not do thee right?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc> <i>[to Arthur]</i></p>

<p>Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss</p>

<p>As seal to this indenture of my love:</p>

<p>That to my home I will no more return</p>

<p>Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,</p>

<p>Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,</p>

<p>Whose foot spurns back the ocean’s roaring tides</p>

<p>And coops from other lands her islanders,</p>

<p>Even till that England, hedged in with the main,</p>

<p>That water-walled bulwark, still secure</p>

<p>And confident from foreign purposes,</p>

<p>Even till that utmost corner of the West</p>

<p>Salute thee for her king. Till then, fair boy,</p>

<p>Will I not think of home, but follow arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>O, take his mother’s thanks, a widow’s thanks,</p>

<p>Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength</p>

<p>To make a more requital to your love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc></p>

<p>The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords</p>

<p>In such a just and charitable war.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Well, then, to work. Our cannon shall be bent</p>

<p>Against the brows of this resisting town.</p>

<p>Call for our chiefest men of discipline</p>

<p>To cull the plots of best advantages.</p>

<p>We’ll lay before this town our royal bones,</p>

<p>Wade to the marketplace in Frenchmen’s blood,</p>

<p>But we will make it subject to this boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Stay for an answer to your embassy,</p>

<p>Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood.</p>

<p>My lord Chatillion may from England bring</p>

<p>That right in peace which here we urge in war,</p>

<p>And then we shall repent each drop of blood</p>

<p>That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Chatillion.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>A wonder, lady! Lo, upon thy wish</p>

<p>Our messenger Chatillion is arrived.–</p>

<p>What England says say briefly, gentle lord.</p>

<p>We coldly pause for thee. Chatillion, speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Chatillion</sc></p>

<p>Then turn your forces from this paltry siege</p>

<p>And stir them up against a mightier task.</p>

<p>England, impatient of your just demands,</p>

<p>Hath put himself in arms. The adverse winds,</p>

<p>Whose leisure I have stayed, have given him time</p>

<p>To land his legions all as soon as I.</p>

<p>His marches are expedient to this town,</p>

<p>His forces strong, his soldiers confident.</p>

<p>With him along is come the Mother Queen,</p>

<p>An Ate stirring him to blood and strife;</p>

<p>With her her niece, the Lady Blanche of Spain;</p>

<p>With them a bastard of the King’s deceased.</p>

<p>And all th’ unsettled humors of the land–</p>

<p>Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,</p>

<p>With ladies’ faces and fierce dragons’ spleens–</p>

<p>Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,</p>

<p>Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,</p>

<p>To make a hazard of new fortunes here.</p>

<p>In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits</p>

<p>Than now the English bottoms have waft o’er</p>

<p>Did never float upon the swelling tide</p>

<p>To do offense and scathe in Christendom.</p>

<p><center><i>[Drum beats.]</i></center></p>

<p>The interruption of their churlish drums</p>

<p>Cuts off more circumstance. They are at hand,</p>

<p>To parley or to fight, therefore prepare.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>How much unlooked-for is this expedition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc></p>

<p>By how much unexpected, by so much</p>

<p>We must awake endeavor for defense,</p>

<p>For courage mounteth with occasion.</p>

<p>Let them be welcome, then. We are prepared.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King John of England, Bastard, Queen</p>

<p>Eleanor, Blanche, Salisbury, Pembroke, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Peace be to France, if France in peace permit</p>

<p>Our just and lineal entrance to our own.</p>

<p>If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,</p>

<p>Whiles we, God’s wrathful agent, do correct</p>

<p>Their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Peace be to England, if that war return</p>

<p>From France to England, there to live in peace.</p>

<p>England we love, and for that England’s sake</p>

<p>With burden of our armor here we sweat.</p>

<p>This toil of ours should be a work of thine;</p>

<p>But thou from loving England art so far</p>

<p>That thou hast underwrought his lawful king,</p>

<p>Cut off the sequence of posterity,</p>

<p>Outfaced infant state, and done a rape</p>

<p>Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.</p>

<p>Look here upon thy brother Geoffrey’s face.</p>

<p><center><i>[He points to Arthur.]</i></center></p>

<p>These eyes, these brows, were molded out of his;</p>

<p>This little abstract doth contain that large</p>

<p>Which died in Geoffrey, and the hand of time</p>

<p>Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.</p>

<p>That Geoffrey was thy elder brother born,</p>

<p>And this his son. England was Geoffrey’s right,</p>

<p>And this is Geoffrey’s. In the name of God,</p>

<p>How comes it then that thou art called a king,</p>

<p>When living blood doth in these temples beat</p>

<p>Which owe the crown that thou o’ermasterest?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>From whom hast thou this great commission,</p>

<p>France,</p>

<p>To draw my answer from thy articles?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts</p>

<p>In any breast of strong authority</p>

<p>To look into the blots and stains of right.</p>

<p>That judge hath made me guardian to this boy,</p>

<p>Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong,</p>

<p>And by whose help I mean to chastise it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Alack, thou dost usurp authority.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Excuse it is to beat usurping down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Eleanor</sc></p>

<p>Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Let me make answer: thy usurping son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Eleanor</sc></p>

<p>Out, insolent! Thy bastard shall be king</p>

<p>That thou mayst be a queen and check the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>My bed was ever to thy son as true</p>

<p>As thine was to thy husband, and this boy</p>

<p>Liker in feature to his father Geoffrey</p>

<p>Than thou and John, in manners being as like</p>

<p>As rain to water or devil to his dam.</p>

<p>My boy a bastard? By my soul, I think</p>

<p>His father never was so true begot.</p>

<p>It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Eleanor</sc> <i>[to Arthur]</i></p>

<p>There’s a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>There’s a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc></p>

<p>Peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc>  Hear the crier!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc>  What the devil art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>One that will play the devil, sir, with you,</p>

<p>An he may catch your hide and you alone.</p>

<p>You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,</p>

<p>Whose valor plucks dead lions by the beard.</p>

<p>I’ll smoke your skin-coat an I catch you right.</p>

<p>Sirrah, look to ’t. I’ faith, I will, i’ faith!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blanche</sc></p>

<p>O, well did he become that lion’s robe</p>

<p>That did disrobe the lion of that robe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>It lies as sightly on the back of him</p>

<p>As great Alcides’ shoes upon an ass.–</p>

<p>But, ass, I’ll take that burden from your back</p>

<p>Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc></p>

<p>What cracker is this same that deafs our ears</p>

<p>With this abundance of superfluous breath?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Louis, determine what we shall do straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Women and fools, break off your conference.–</p>

<p>King John, this is the very sum of all:</p>

<p>England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,</p>

<p>In right of Arthur do I claim of thee.</p>

<p>Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>My life as soon! I do defy thee, France.–</p>

<p>Arthur of Brittany, yield thee to my hand,</p>

<p>And out of my dear love I’ll give thee more</p>

<p>Than e’er the coward hand of France can win.</p>

<p>Submit thee, boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Eleanor</sc>  Come to thy grandam, child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Do, child, go to it grandam, child.</p>

<p>Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will</p>

<p>Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig.</p>

<p>There’s a good grandam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arthur</sc> <i>[weeping]</i>  Good my mother, peace.</p>

<p>I would that I were low laid in my grave.</p>

<p>I am not worth this coil that’s made for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Eleanor</sc></p>

<p>His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Now shame upon you whe’er she does or no!</p>

<p>His grandam’s wrongs, and not his mother’s</p>

<p>shames,</p>

<p>Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor</p>

<p>eyes,</p>

<p>Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee.</p>

<p>Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed</p>

<p>To do him justice and revenge on you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Eleanor</sc></p>

<p>Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and Earth!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and Earth,</p>

<p>Call not me slanderer. Thou and thine usurp</p>

<p>The dominations, royalties, and rights</p>

<p>Of this oppressed boy. This is thy eldest son’s son,</p>

<p>Infortunate in nothing but in thee.</p>

<p>Thy sins are visited in this poor child.</p>

<p>The canon of the law is laid on him,</p>

<p>Being but the second generation</p>

<p>Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Bedlam, have done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc>  I have but this to say,</p>

<p>That he is not only plagued for her sin,</p>

<p>But God hath made her sin and her the plague</p>

<p>On this removed issue, plagued for her,</p>

<p>And with her plague; her sin his injury,</p>

<p>Her injury the beadle to her sin,</p>

<p>All punished in the person of this child</p>

<p>And all for her. A plague upon her!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Eleanor</sc></p>

<p>Thou unadvised scold, I can produce</p>

<p>A will that bars the title of thy son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Ay, who doubts that? A will–a wicked will,</p>

<p>A woman’s will, a cankered grandam’s will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Peace, lady. Pause, or be more temperate.</p>

<p>It ill beseems this presence to cry aim</p>

<p>To these ill-tuned repetitions.–</p>

<p>Some trumpet summon hither to the walls</p>

<p>These men of Angiers. Let us hear them speak</p>

<p>Whose title they admit, Arthur’s or John’s.</p>

<p><center><i>[Trumpet sounds.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Citizens upon the walls.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Who is it that hath warned us to the walls?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>’Tis France, for England.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc>  England, for itself.</p>

<p>You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>You loving men of Angiers, Arthur’s subjects,</p>

<p>Our trumpet called you to this gentle parle–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>For our advantage. Therefore hear us first.</p>

<p>These flags of France that are advanced here</p>

<p>Before the eye and prospect of your town,</p>

<p>Have hither marched to your endamagement.</p>

<p>The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,</p>

<p>And ready mounted are they to spit forth</p>

<p>Their iron indignation ’gainst your walls.</p>

<p>All preparation for a bloody siege</p>

<p>And merciless proceeding by these French</p>

<p>Confronts your city’s eyes, your winking gates,</p>

<p>And, but for our approach, those sleeping stones,</p>

<p>That as a waist doth girdle you about,</p>

<p>By the compulsion of their ordinance</p>

<p>By this time from their fixed beds of lime</p>

<p>Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made</p>

<p>For bloody power to rush upon your peace.</p>

<p>But on the sight of us your lawful king,</p>

<p>Who painfully with much expedient march</p>

<p>Have brought a countercheck before your gates</p>

<p>To save unscratched your city’s threatened cheeks,</p>

<p>Behold, the French, amazed, vouchsafe a parle.</p>

<p>And now, instead of bullets wrapped in fire</p>

<p>To make a shaking fever in your walls,</p>

<p>They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke</p>

<p>To make a faithless error in your ears,</p>

<p>Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,</p>

<p>And let us in. Your king, whose labored spirits</p>

<p>Forwearied in this action of swift speed,</p>

<p>Craves harborage within your city walls.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>When I have said, make answer to us both.</p>

<p><center><i>[He takes Arthur by the hand.]</i></center></p>

<p>Lo, in this right hand, whose protection</p>

<p>Is most divinely vowed upon the right</p>

<p>Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,</p>

<p>Son to the elder brother of this man,</p>

<p>And king o’er him and all that he enjoys.</p>

<p>For this downtrodden equity we tread</p>

<p>In warlike march these greens before your town,</p>

<p>Being no further enemy to you</p>

<p>Than the constraint of hospitable zeal</p>

<p>In the relief of this oppressed child</p>

<p>Religiously provokes. Be pleased then</p>

<p>To pay that duty which you truly owe</p>

<p>To him that owes it, namely, this young prince,</p>

<p>And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear</p>

<p>Save in aspect, hath all offense sealed up.</p>

<p>Our cannons’ malice vainly shall be spent</p>

<p>Against th’ invulnerable clouds of heaven,</p>

<p>And with a blessed and unvexed retire,</p>

<p>With unbacked swords and helmets all unbruised,</p>

<p>We will bear home that lusty blood again</p>

<p>Which here we came to spout against your town,</p>

<p>And leave your children, wives, and you in peace.</p>

<p>But if you fondly pass our proffered offer,</p>

<p>’Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls</p>

<p>Can hide you from our messengers of war,</p>

<p>Though all these English and their discipline</p>

<p>Were harbored in their rude circumference.</p>

<p>Then tell us, shall your city call us lord</p>

<p>In that behalf which we have challenged it?</p>

<p>Or shall we give the signal to our rage</p>

<p>And stalk in blood to our possession?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>In brief, we are the King of England’s subjects.</p>

<p>For him, and in his right, we hold this town.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Acknowledge then the King and let me in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>That can we not. But he that proves the King,</p>

<p>To him will we prove loyal. Till that time</p>

<p>Have we rammed up our gates against the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Doth not the crown of England prove the King?</p>

<p>And if not that, I bring you witnesses,</p>

<p>Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England’s breed–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc>  Bastards and else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>To verify our title with their lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>As many and as wellborn bloods as those–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc>  Some bastards too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Stand in his face to contradict his claim.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Till you compound whose right is worthiest,</p>

<p>We for the worthiest hold the right from both.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Then God forgive the sin of all those souls</p>

<p>That to their everlasting residence,</p>

<p>Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet</p>

<p>In dreadful trial of our kingdom’s king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Amen, amen.–Mount, chevaliers! To arms!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>Saint George, that swinged the dragon and e’er</p>

<p>You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,</p>

<p>Much work for tears in many an English mother,</p>

<p>Our colors do return in those same hands</p>

<p>That did display them when we first marched forth,</p>

<p>And like a jolly troop of huntsmen come</p>

<p>Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,</p>

<p>Open your gates, and give the victors way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Heralds, from off our towers we might behold</p>

<p>From first to last the onset and retire</p>

<p>Of both your armies, whose equality</p>

<p>By our best eyes cannot be censured.</p>

<p>Blood hath bought blood, and blows have answered</p>

<p>blows,</p>

<p>Strength matched with strength, and power</p>

<p>confronted power.</p>

<p>Both are alike, and both alike we like.</p>

<p>One must prove greatest. While they weigh so even,</p>

<p>Whose passage, vexed with thy impediment,</p>

<p>Shall leave his native channel and o’erswell</p>

<p>With course disturbed even thy confining shores,</p>

<p>Unless thou let his silver water keep</p>

<p>A peaceful progress to the ocean?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood</p>

<p>In this hot trial more than we of France,</p>

<p>Rather lost more. And by this hand I swear</p>

<p>That sways the earth this climate overlooks,</p>

<p>Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,</p>

<p>We’ll put thee down, ’gainst whom these arms we</p>

<p>bear,</p>

<p>Or add a royal number to the dead,</p>

<p>Gracing the scroll that tells of this war’s loss</p>

<p>With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Ha, majesty! How high thy glory towers</p>

<p>When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!</p>

<p>O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel,</p>

<p>The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs,</p>

<p>And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men</p>

<p>In undetermined differences of kings.</p>

<p>Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?</p>

<p>Cry havoc, kings! Back to the stained field,</p>

<p>You equal potents, fiery-kindled spirits.</p>

<p>Then let confusion of one part confirm</p>

<p>The other’s peace. Till then, blows, blood, and</p>

<p>death!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Speak, citizens, for England. Who’s your king?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>The King of England, when we know the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Know him in us, that here hold up his right.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>In us, that are our own great deputy</p>

<p>And bear possession of our person here,</p>

<p>Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>A greater power than we denies all this,</p>

<p>And till it be undoubted, we do lock</p>

<p>Our former scruple in our strong-barred gates,</p>

<p>Kings of our fear, until our fears resolved</p>

<p>Be by some certain king purged and deposed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,</p>

<p>And stand securely on their battlements</p>

<p>As in a theater, whence they gape and point</p>

<p>At your industrious scenes and acts of death.</p>

<p>Your royal presences, be ruled by me:</p>

<p>Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,</p>

<p>Be friends awhile, and both conjointly bend</p>

<p>Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town.</p>

<p>By east and west let France and England mount</p>

<p>Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,</p>

<p>Till their soul-fearing clamors have brawled down</p>

<p>The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city.</p>

<p>I’d play incessantly upon these jades,</p>

<p>Even till unfenced desolation</p>

<p>Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.</p>

<p>That done, dissever your united strengths</p>

<p>And part your mingled colors once again;</p>

<p>Turn face to face and bloody point to point.</p>

<p>Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth</p>

<p>Out of one side her happy minion,</p>

<p>To whom in favor she shall give the day</p>

<p>And kiss him with a glorious victory.</p>

<p>How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?</p>

<p>Smacks it not something of the policy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Now by the sky that hangs above our heads,</p>

<p>I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers</p>

<p>And lay this Angiers even with the ground,</p>

<p>Then after fight who shall be king of it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc> <i>[to King Philip]</i></p>

<p>An if thou hast the mettle of a king,</p>

<p>Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,</p>

<p>Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,</p>

<p>As we will ours, against these saucy walls,</p>

<p>And when that we have dashed them to the ground,</p>

<p>Why, then, defy each other and pell-mell</p>

<p>Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>We from the west will send destruction</p>

<p>Into this city’s bosom.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc>  I from the north.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc>  Our thunder from the south</p>

<p>Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>O, prudent discipline! From north to south,</p>

<p>Austria and France shoot in each other’s mouth.</p>

<p>I’ll stir them to it. – Come, away, away!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Hear us, great kings. Vouchsafe awhile to stay,</p>

<p>And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league,</p>

<p>Win you this city without stroke or wound,</p>

<p>Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds</p>

<p>That here come sacrifices for the field.</p>

<p>Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Speak on with favor. We are bent to hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanche,</p>

<p>Is near to England. Look upon the years</p>

<p>Of Louis the Dauphin and that lovely maid.</p>

<p>If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,</p>

<p>Where should he find it fairer than in Blanche?</p>

<p>If zealous love should go in search of virtue,</p>

<p>Where should he find it purer than in Blanche?</p>

<p>If love ambitious sought a match of birth,</p>

<p>Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady</p>

<p>Blanche?</p>

<p>Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,</p>

<p>Is the young Dauphin every way complete.</p>

<p>If not complete of, say he is not she,</p>

<p>And she again wants nothing, to name want,</p>

<p>If want it be not that she is not he.</p>

<p>He is the half part of a blessed man,</p>

<p>Left to be finished by such as she,</p>

<p>And she a fair divided excellence,</p>

<p>Whose fullness of perfection lies in him.</p>

<p>O, two such silver currents when they join</p>

<p>Do glorify the banks that bound them in,</p>

<p>And two such shores to two such streams made one,</p>

<p>Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,</p>

<p>To these two princes, if you marry them.</p>

<p>This union shall do more than battery can</p>

<p>To our fast-closed gates, for at this match,</p>

<p>With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,</p>

<p>The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope</p>

<p>And give you entrance. But without this match,</p>

<p>The sea enraged is not half so deaf,</p>

<p>Lions more confident, mountains and rocks</p>

<p>More free from motion, no, not Death himself</p>

<p>In mortal fury half so peremptory</p>

<p>As we to keep this city.</p>

<p><center><i>[King Philip and Louis the Dauphin</p>

<p>walk aside and talk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Here’s a stay</p>

<p>That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death</p>

<p>Out of his rags! Here’s a large mouth indeed</p>

<p>That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and</p>

<p>seas;</p>

<p>Talks as familiarly of roaring lions</p>

<p>As maids of thirteen do of puppy dogs.</p>

<p>What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?</p>

<p>He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke, and</p>

<p>bounce.</p>

<p>He gives the bastinado with his tongue.</p>

<p>Our ears are cudgeled. Not a word of his</p>

<p>But buffets better than a fist of France.</p>

<p>Zounds, I was never so bethumped with words</p>

<p>Since I first called my brother’s father Dad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Eleanor</sc> <i>[aside to King John]</i></p>

<p>Son, list to this conjunction; make this match.</p>

<p>Give with our niece a dowry large enough,</p>

<p>For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie</p>

<p>Thy now unsured assurance to the crown</p>

<p>That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe</p>

<p>The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.</p>

<p>I see a yielding in the looks of France.</p>

<p>Mark how they whisper. Urge them while their</p>

<p>souls</p>

<p>Are capable of this ambition,</p>

<p>Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath</p>

<p>Of soft petitions, pity, and remorse,</p>

<p>Cool and congeal again to what it was.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Why answer not the double majesties</p>

<p>This friendly treaty of our threatened town?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Speak England first, that hath been forward first</p>

<p>To speak unto this city. What say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,</p>

<p>Can in this book of beauty read “I love,”</p>

<p>Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen.</p>

<p>For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poitiers,</p>

<p>And all that we upon this side the sea–</p>

<p>Except this city now by us besieged–</p>

<p>Find liable to our crown and dignity,</p>

<p>Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich</p>

<p>In titles, honors, and promotions,</p>

<p>As she in beauty, education, blood,</p>

<p>Holds hand with any princess of the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>What sayst thou, boy? Look in the lady’s face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>I do, my lord, and in her eye I find</p>

<p>A wonder or a wondrous miracle,</p>

<p>The shadow of myself formed in her eye,</p>

<p>Which, being but the shadow of your son,</p>

<p>Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow.</p>

<p>I do protest I never loved myself</p>

<p>Till now infixed I beheld myself</p>

<p>Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.</p>

<p><center><i>[He whispers with Blanche.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>“Drawn in the flattering table of her eye”?</p>

<p>   <i>Hanged in the frowning wrinkle of her brow</i></p>

<p>And quartered in her heart! He doth espy</p>

<p>   <i>Himself love’s traitor. This is pity now,</i></p>

<p>That hanged and drawn and quartered there should</p>

<p>be</p>

<p>In such a love so vile a lout as he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blanche</sc> <i>[aside to Dauphin]</i></p>

<p>My uncle’s will in this respect is mine.</p>

<p>If he see aught in you that makes him like,</p>

<p>That anything he sees which moves his liking</p>

<p>I can with ease translate it to my will.</p>

<p>Or if you will, to speak more properly,</p>

<p>I will enforce it eas’ly to my love.</p>

<p>Further I will not flatter you, my lord,</p>

<p>That all I see in you is worthy love,</p>

<p>Than this: that nothing do I see in you,</p>

<p>Though churlish thoughts themselves should be</p>

<p>your judge,</p>

<p>That I can find should merit any hate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>What say these young ones? What say you, my</p>

<p>niece?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blanche</sc></p>

<p>That she is bound in honor still to do</p>

<p>What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Speak then, Prince Dauphin. Can you love this lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love,</p>

<p>For I do love her most unfeignedly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,</p>

<p>Poitiers and Anjou, these five provinces</p>

<p>With her to thee, and this addition more:</p>

<p>Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.–</p>

<p>Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,</p>

<p>Command thy son and daughter to join hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>It likes us well.–Young princes, close your hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc></p>

<p>And your lips too, for I am well assured</p>

<p>That I did so when I was first assured.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dauphin and Blanche join hands and kiss.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates.</p>

<p>Let in that amity which you have made,</p>

<p>For at Saint Mary’s Chapel presently</p>

<p>The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.–</p>

<p>Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?</p>

<p>I know she is not, for this match made up</p>

<p>Her presence would have interrupted much.</p>

<p>Where is she and her son? Tell me, who knows.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>She is sad and passionate at your Highness’ tent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>And by my faith, this league that we have made</p>

<p>Will give her sadness very little cure.–</p>

<p>Brother of England, how may we content</p>

<p>This widow lady? In her right we came,</p>

<p>Which we, God knows, have turned another way</p>

<p>To our own vantage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc>  We will heal up all,</p>

<p>For we’ll create young Arthur Duke of Brittany</p>

<p>And Earl of Richmond, and this rich, fair town</p>

<p>We make him lord of.–Call the Lady Constance.</p>

<p>Some speedy messenger bid her repair</p>

<p>To our solemnity. <i>[Salisbury exits.]</i> I trust we</p>

<p>shall,</p>

<p>If not fill up the measure of her will,</p>

<p>Yet in some measure satisfy her so</p>

<p>That we shall stop her exclamation.</p>

<p>Go we as well as haste will suffer us</p>

<p>To this unlooked-for, unprepared pomp.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but the Bastard exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>Mad world, mad kings, mad composition!</p>

<p>John, to stop Arthur’s title in the whole,</p>

<p>Hath willingly departed with a part;</p>

<p>And France, whose armor conscience buckled on,</p>

<p>Whom zeal and charity brought to the field</p>

<p>As God’s own soldier, rounded in the ear</p>

<p>With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,</p>

<p>That broker that still breaks the pate of faith,</p>

<p>That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,</p>

<p>Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids–</p>

<p>Who having no external thing to lose</p>

<p>But the word “maid,” cheats the poor maid of</p>

<p>that–</p>

<p>That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,</p>

<p>Commodity, the bias of the world–</p>

<p>The world, who of itself is peised well,</p>

<p>Made to run even upon even ground,</p>

<p>Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,</p>

<p>This sway of motion, this Commodity,</p>

<p>Makes it take head from all indifferency,</p>

<p>From all direction, purpose, course, intent.</p>

<p>And this same bias, this Commodity,</p>

<p>This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,</p>

<p>Clapped on the outward eye of fickle France,</p>

<p>Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,</p>

<p>From a resolved and honorable war</p>

<p>To a most base and vile-concluded peace.</p>

<p>And why rail I on this Commodity?</p>

<p>But for because he hath not wooed me yet.</p>

<p>Not that I have the power to clutch my hand</p>

<p>When his fair angels would salute my palm,</p>

<p>But for my hand, as unattempted yet,</p>

<p>Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich.</p>

<p>Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail</p>

<p>And say there is no sin but to be rich;</p>

<p>And being rich, my virtue then shall be</p>

<p>To say there is no vice but beggary.</p>

<p>Since kings break faith upon Commodity,</p>

<p>Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee!</p>
