<p><center><i>[Enter, in arms, Louis the Dauphin, Salisbury, Melun,</p>

<p>Pembroke, Bigot, and French and English Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc> <i>[handing a paper to Melun]</i></p>

<p>My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,</p>

<p>And keep it safe for our remembrance.</p>

<p>Return the precedent to these lords again,</p>

<p>That having our fair order written down,</p>

<p>Both they and we, perusing o’er these notes,</p>

<p>May know wherefore we took the Sacrament,</p>

<p>And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>Upon our sides it never shall be broken.</p>

<p>And, noble dauphin, albeit we swear</p>

<p>A voluntary zeal and unurged faith</p>

<p>To your proceedings, yet believe me, prince,</p>

<p>I am not glad that such a sore of time</p>

<p>Should seek a plaster by contemned revolt</p>

<p>And heal the inveterate canker of one wound</p>

<p>By making many. O, it grieves my soul</p>

<p>That I must draw this metal from my side</p>

<p>To be a widow-maker! O, and there</p>

<p>Where honorable rescue and defense</p>

<p>Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!</p>

<p>But such is the infection of the time</p>

<p>That for the health and physic of our right,</p>

<p>We cannot deal but with the very hand</p>

<p>Of stern injustice and confused wrong.</p>

<p>And is ’t not pity, O my grieved friends,</p>

<p>That we, the sons and children of this isle,</p>

<p>Was born to see so sad an hour as this,</p>

<p>Wherein we step after a stranger, march</p>

<p>Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up</p>

<p>Her enemies’ ranks? I must withdraw and weep</p>

<p>Upon the spot of this enforced cause,</p>

<p>To grace the gentry of a land remote,</p>

<p>And follow unacquainted colors here.</p>

<p>What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove,</p>

<p>That Neptune’s arms, who clippeth thee about,</p>

<p>Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself</p>

<p>And grapple thee unto a pagan shore,</p>

<p>Where these two Christian armies might combine</p>

<p>The blood of malice in a vein of league,</p>

<p>And not to spend it so unneighborly.     <i><i>[He weeps.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>A noble temper dost thou show in this,</p>

<p>And great affections wrestling in thy bosom</p>

<p>Doth make an earthquake of nobility.</p>

<p>O, what a noble combat hast thou fought</p>

<p>Between compulsion and a brave respect!</p>

<p>Let me wipe off this honorable dew</p>

<p>That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks.</p>

<p>My heart hath melted at a lady’s tears,</p>

<p>Being an ordinary inundation,</p>

<p>But this effusion of such manly drops,</p>

<p>This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,</p>

<p>Startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed</p>

<p>Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven</p>

<p>Figured quite o’er with burning meteors.</p>

<p>Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,</p>

<p>And with a great heart heave away this storm.</p>

<p>Commend these waters to those baby eyes</p>

<p>That never saw the giant world enraged,</p>

<p>Nor met with fortune other than at feasts</p>

<p>Full warm of blood, of mirth, of gossiping.</p>

<p>Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep</p>

<p>Into the purse of rich prosperity</p>

<p>As Louis himself.–So, nobles, shall you all,</p>

<p>That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.</p>

<p>And even there, methinks, an angel spake.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pandulph.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look where the holy legate comes apace</p>

<p>To give us warrant from the hand of God,</p>

<p>And on our actions set the name of right</p>

<p>With holy breath.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc>  Hail, noble prince of France.</p>

<p>The next is this: King John hath reconciled</p>

<p>Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in</p>

<p>That so stood out against the holy Church,</p>

<p>The great metropolis and See of Rome.</p>

<p>Therefore thy threat’ning colors now wind up,</p>

<p>And tame the savage spirit of wild war</p>

<p>That, like a lion fostered up at hand,</p>

<p>It may lie gently at the foot of peace</p>

<p>And be no further harmful than in show.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Your Grace shall pardon me; I will not back.</p>

<p>I am too high-born to be propertied,</p>

<p>To be a secondary at control,</p>

<p>Or useful servingman and instrument</p>

<p>To any sovereign state throughout the world.</p>

<p>Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars</p>

<p>Between this chastised kingdom and myself</p>

<p>And brought in matter that should feed this fire;</p>

<p>And now ’tis far too huge to be blown out</p>

<p>With that same weak wind which enkindled it.</p>

<p>You taught me how to know the face of right,</p>

<p>Acquainted me with interest to this land,</p>

<p>Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart.</p>

<p>And come you now to tell me John hath made</p>

<p>His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?</p>

<p>I, by the honor of my marriage bed,</p>

<p>After young Arthur claim this land for mine.</p>

<p>And now it is half conquered, must I back</p>

<p>Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?</p>

<p>Am I Rome’s slave? What penny hath Rome borne?</p>

<p>What men provided? What munition sent</p>

<p>To underprop this action? Is ’t not I</p>

<p>That undergo this charge? Who else but I,</p>

<p>And such as to my claim are liable,</p>

<p>Sweat in this business and maintain this war?</p>

<p>Have I not heard these islanders shout out</p>

<p>“Vive le Roi” as I have banked their towns?</p>

<p>Have I not here the best cards for the game</p>

<p>To win this easy match played for a crown?</p>

<p>And shall I now give o’er the yielded set?</p>

<p>No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>You look but on the outside of this work.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Outside or inside, I will not return</p>

<p>Till my attempt so much be glorified</p>

<p>As to my ample hope was promised</p>

<p>Before I drew this gallant head of war</p>

<p>And culled these fiery spirits from the world</p>

<p>To outlook conquest and to win renown</p>

<p>Even in the jaws of danger and of death.</p>

<p><center><i>[A trumpet sounds.]</i></center></p>

<p>What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bastard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>According to the fair play of the world,</p>

<p>Let me have audience. I am sent to speak,</p>

<p>My holy lord of Milan, from the King.</p>

<p>I come to learn how you have dealt for him,</p>

<p>And, as you answer, I do know the scope</p>

<p>And warrant limited unto my tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>The Dauphin is too willful-opposite</p>

<p>And will not temporize with my entreaties.</p>

<p>He flatly says he’ll not lay down his arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>By all the blood that ever fury breathed,</p>

<p>The youth says well! Now hear our English king,</p>

<p>For thus his royalty doth speak in me:</p>

<p>He is prepared–and reason too he should.</p>

<p>This apish and unmannerly approach,</p>

<p>This harnessed masque and unadvised revel,</p>

<p>This unheard sauciness and boyish troops,</p>

<p>The King doth smile at, and is well prepared</p>

<p>To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,</p>

<p>From out the circle of his territories.</p>

<p>That hand which had the strength, even at your door,</p>

<p>To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,</p>

<p>To dive like buckets in concealed wells,</p>

<p>To crouch in litter of your stable planks,</p>

<p>To lie like pawns locked up in chests and trunks,</p>

<p>To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out</p>

<p>In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake</p>

<p>Even at the crying of your nation’s crow,</p>

<p>Thinking this voice an armed Englishman–</p>

<p>Shall that victorious hand be feebled here</p>

<p>That in your chambers gave you chastisement?</p>

<p>No! Know the gallant monarch is in arms,</p>

<p>And like an eagle o’er his aerie towers</p>

<p>To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.–</p>

<p>And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,</p>

<p>You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb</p>

<p>Of your dear mother England, blush for shame!</p>

<p>For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids</p>

<p>Like Amazons come tripping after drums,</p>

<p>Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,</p>

<p>Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts</p>

<p>To fierce and bloody inclination.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>There end thy brave and turn thy face in peace.</p>

<p>We grant thou canst outscold us. Fare thee well.</p>

<p>We hold our time too precious to be spent</p>

<p>With such a brabbler.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc>  Give me leave to speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>No, I will speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc>  We will attend to neither.</p>

<p>Strike up the drums, and let the tongue of war</p>

<p>Plead for our interest and our being here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>Indeed, your drums being beaten will cry out,</p>

<p>And so shall you, being beaten. Do but start</p>

<p>An echo with the clamor of thy drum,</p>

<p>And even at hand a drum is ready braced</p>

<p>That shall reverberate all as loud as thine.</p>

<p>Sound but another, and another shall,</p>

<p>As loud as thine, rattle the welkin’s ear</p>

<p>And mock the deep-mouthed thunder. For at hand,</p>

<p>Not trusting to this halting legate here,</p>

<p>Whom he hath used rather for sport than need,</p>

<p>Is warlike John, and in his forehead sits</p>

<p>A bare-ribbed Death, whose office is this day</p>

<p>To feast upon whole thousands of the French.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Strike up our drums to find this danger out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>And thou shalt find it, dauphin, do not doubt.</p>
