<p><center><i>[Enter King Philip of France,Louis the Dauphin,</p>

<p>Pandulph, Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,</p>

<p>A whole armada of convicted sail</p>

<p>Is scattered and disjoined from fellowship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>Courage and comfort. All shall yet go well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>What can go well when we have run so ill?</p>

<p>Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?</p>

<p>Arthur ta’en prisoner? Divers dear friends slain?</p>

<p>And bloody England into England gone,</p>

<p>O’erbearing interruption, spite of France?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>What he hath won, that hath he fortified.</p>

<p>So hot a speed, with such advice disposed,</p>

<p>Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,</p>

<p>Doth want example. Who hath read or heard</p>

<p>Of any kindred action like to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Well could I bear that England had this praise,</p>

<p>So we could find some pattern of our shame.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Constance, with her hair unbound.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look who comes here! A grave unto a soul,</p>

<p>Holding th’ eternal spirit against her will</p>

<p>In the vile prison of afflicted breath.–</p>

<p>I prithee, lady, go away with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Lo, now, now see the issue of your peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Patience, good lady. Comfort, gentle Constance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>No, I defy all counsel, all redress,</p>

<p>But that which ends all counsel, true redress.</p>

<p>Death, death, O amiable, lovely death,</p>

<p>Thou odoriferous stench, sound rottenness,</p>

<p>Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,</p>

<p>Thou hate and terror to prosperity,</p>

<p>And I will kiss thy detestable bones</p>

<p>And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows,</p>

<p>And ring these fingers with thy household worms,</p>

<p>And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust,</p>

<p>And be a carrion monster like thyself.</p>

<p>Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smil’st,</p>

<p>And buss thee as thy wife. Misery’s love,</p>

<p>O, come to me!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc>  O fair affliction, peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.</p>

<p>O, that my tongue were in the thunder’s mouth!</p>

<p>Then with a passion would I shake the world</p>

<p>And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy</p>

<p>Which cannot hear a lady’s feeble voice,</p>

<p>Which scorns a modern invocation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>Lady, you utter madness and not sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Thou art not holy to belie me so.</p>

<p>I am not mad. This hair I tear is mine;</p>

<p>My name is Constance; I was Geoffrey’s wife;</p>

<p>Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost.</p>

<p>I am not mad; I would to heaven I were,</p>

<p>For then ’tis like I should forget myself.</p>

<p>O, if I could, what grief should I forget!</p>

<p>Preach some philosophy to make me mad,</p>

<p>And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal.</p>

<p>For, being not mad but sensible of grief,</p>

<p>My reasonable part produces reason</p>

<p>How I may be delivered of these woes,</p>

<p>And teaches me to kill or hang myself.</p>

<p>If I were mad, I should forget my son,</p>

<p>Or madly think a babe of clouts were he.</p>

<p>I am not mad. Too well, too well I feel</p>

<p>The different plague of each calamity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Bind up those tresses.–O, what love I note</p>

<p>In the fair multitude of those her hairs;</p>

<p>Where but by chance a silver drop hath fall’n,</p>

<p>Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends</p>

<p>Do glue themselves in sociable grief,</p>

<p>Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,</p>

<p>Sticking together in calamity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>To England, if you will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc>  Bind up your hairs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Yes, that I will. And wherefore will I do it?</p>

<p>I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud</p>

<p>“O, that these hands could so redeem my son,</p>

<p>As they have given these hairs their liberty!”</p>

<p>But now I envy at their liberty,</p>

<p>And will again commit them to their bonds,</p>

<p>Because my poor child is a prisoner.</p>

<p><center><i>[She binds up her hair.]</i></center></p>

<p>And father cardinal, I have heard you say</p>

<p>That we shall see and know our friends in heaven.</p>

<p>If that be true, I shall see my boy again;</p>

<p>For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,</p>

<p>To him that did but yesterday suspire,</p>

<p>There was not such a gracious creature born.</p>

<p>But now will canker sorrow eat my bud</p>

<p>And chase the native beauty from his cheek,</p>

<p>And he will look as hollow as a ghost,</p>

<p>As dim and meager as an ague’s fit,</p>

<p>And so he’ll die; and, rising so again,</p>

<p>When I shall meet him in the court of heaven</p>

<p>I shall not know him. Therefore never, never</p>

<p>Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>You hold too heinous a respect of grief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>He talks to me that never had a son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>You are as fond of grief as of your child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Grief fills the room up of my absent child,</p>

<p>Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,</p>

<p>Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,</p>

<p>Remembers me of all his gracious parts,</p>

<p>Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;</p>

<p>Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?</p>

<p>Fare you well. Had you such a loss as I,</p>

<p>I could give better comfort than you do.</p>

<p><center><i>[She unbinds her hair.]</i></center></p>

<p>I will not keep this form upon my head</p>

<p>When there is such disorder in my wit.</p>

<p>O Lord! My boy, my Arthur, my fair son,</p>

<p>My life, my joy, my food, my all the world,</p>

<p>My widow-comfort and my sorrows’ cure!     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>I fear some outrage, and I’ll follow her.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>There’s nothing in this world can make me joy.</p>

<p>Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale,</p>

<p>Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;</p>

<p>And bitter shame hath spoiled the sweet world’s</p>

<p>taste,</p>

<p>That it yields naught but shame and bitterness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>Before the curing of a strong disease,</p>

<p>Even in the instant of repair and health,</p>

<p>The fit is strongest. Evils that take leave</p>

<p>On their departure most of all show evil.</p>

<p>What have you lost by losing of this day?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>All days of glory, joy, and happiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>If you had won it, certainly you had.</p>

<p>No, no. When Fortune means to men most good,</p>

<p>She looks upon them with a threat’ning eye.</p>

<p>’Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost</p>

<p>In this which he accounts so clearly won.</p>

<p>Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>As heartily as he is glad he hath him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.</p>

<p>Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit.</p>

<p>For even the breath of what I mean to speak</p>

<p>Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,</p>

<p>Out of the path which shall directly lead</p>

<p>Thy foot to England’s throne. And therefore mark:</p>

<p>John hath seized Arthur, and it cannot be</p>

<p>That, whiles warm life plays in that infant’s veins,</p>

<p>The misplaced John should entertain an hour,</p>

<p>One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.</p>

<p>A scepter snatched with an unruly hand</p>

<p>Must be as boisterously maintained as gained.</p>

<p>And he that stands upon a slipp’ry place</p>

<p>Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up.</p>

<p>That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall.</p>

<p>So be it, for it cannot be but so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>But what shall I gain by young Arthur’s fall?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>You, in the right of Lady Blanche your wife,</p>

<p>May then make all the claim that Arthur did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>How green you are and fresh in this old world!</p>

<p>John lays you plots. The times conspire with you,</p>

<p>For he that steeps his safety in true blood</p>

<p>Shall find but bloody safety, and untrue.</p>

<p>This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts</p>

<p>Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,</p>

<p>That none so small advantage shall step forth</p>

<p>To check his reign but they will cherish it.</p>

<p>No natural exhalation in the sky,</p>

<p>No scope of nature, no distempered day,</p>

<p>No common wind, no customed event,</p>

<p>But they will pluck away his natural cause</p>

<p>And call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,</p>

<p>Abortives, presages, and tongues of heaven,</p>

<p>Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Maybe he will not touch young Arthur’s life,</p>

<p>But hold himself safe in his prisonment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,</p>

<p>If that young Arthur be not gone already,</p>

<p>Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts</p>

<p>Of all his people shall revolt from him</p>

<p>And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,</p>

<p>And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath</p>

<p>Out of the bloody fingers’ ends of John.</p>

<p>Methinks I see this hurly all on foot;</p>

<p>And, O, what better matter breeds for you</p>

<p>Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge</p>

<p>Is now in England ransacking the Church,</p>

<p>Offending charity. If but a dozen French</p>

<p>Were there in arms, they would be as a call</p>

<p>To train ten thousand English to their side,</p>

<p>Or as a little snow, tumbled about,</p>

<p>Anon becomes a mountain. O noble dauphin,</p>

<p>Go with me to the King. ’Tis wonderful</p>

<p>What may be wrought out of their discontent,</p>

<p>Now that their souls are topful of offense.</p>

<p>For England, go. I will whet on the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Strong reasons makes strange actions. Let us go.</p>

<p>If you say ay, the King will not say no.</p>
