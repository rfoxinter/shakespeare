<p><center><i>[Enter Prince Henry, Salisbury, and Bigot.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>It is too late. The life of all his blood</p>

<p>Is touched corruptibly, and his pure brain,</p>

<p>Which some suppose the soul’s frail dwelling-house,</p>

<p>Doth, by the idle comments that it makes,</p>

<p>Foretell the ending of mortality.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pembroke.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pembroke</span></p>

<p>His Highness yet doth speak, and holds belief</p>

<p>That being brought into the open air</p>

<p>It would allay the burning quality</p>

<p>Of that fell poison which assaileth him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Let him be brought into the orchard here.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bigot exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Doth he still rage?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pembroke</span>  He is more patient</p>

<p>Than when you left him. Even now he sung.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>O vanity of sickness! Fierce extremes</p>

<p>In their continuance will not feel themselves.</p>

<p>Death, having preyed upon the outward parts,</p>

<p>Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now</p>

<p>Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds</p>

<p>With many legions of strange fantasies,</p>

<p>Which in their throng and press to that last hold</p>

<p>Confound themselves. ’Tis strange that Death should</p>

<p>sing.</p>

<p>I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,</p>

<p>Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,</p>

<p>And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings</p>

<p>His soul and body to their lasting rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Be of good comfort, prince, for you are born</p>

<p>To set a form upon that indigest</p>

<p>Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[King John brought in, attended by Bigot.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room.</p>

<p>It would not out at windows nor at doors.</p>

<p>There is so hot a summer in my bosom</p>

<p>That all my bowels crumble up to dust.</p>

<p>I am a scribbled form drawn with a pen</p>

<p>Upon a parchment, and against this fire</p>

<p>Do I shrink up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  How fares your Majesty?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>Poisoned–ill fare–dead, forsook, cast off,</p>

<p>And none of you will bid the winter come</p>

<p>To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,</p>

<p>Nor let my kingdom’s rivers take their course</p>

<p>Through my burned bosom, nor entreat the North</p>

<p>To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips</p>

<p>And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much.</p>

<p>I beg cold comfort, and you are so strait</p>

<p>And so ingrateful, you deny me that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>O, that there were some virtue in my tears</p>

<p>That might relieve you!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  The salt in them is hot.</p>

<p>Within me is a hell, and there the poison</p>

<p>Is, as a fiend, confined to tyrannize</p>

<p>On unreprievable, condemned blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bastard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>O, I am scalded with my violent motion</p>

<p>And spleen of speed to see your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>John</span></p>

<p>O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye.</p>

<p>The tackle of my heart is cracked and burnt,</p>

<p>And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail</p>

<p>Are turned to one thread, one little hair.</p>

<p>My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,</p>

<p>Which holds but till thy news be uttered,</p>

<p>And then all this thou seest is but a clod</p>

<p>And module of confounded royalty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,</p>

<p>Where God He knows how we shall answer him.</p>

<p>For in a night the best part of my power,</p>

<p>As I upon advantage did remove,</p>

<p>Were in the Washes all unwarily</p>

<p>Devoured by the unexpected flood.</p>

<p><center><i>[King John dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.–</p>

<p>My liege! My lord!–But now a king, now thus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Even so must I run on, and even so stop.</p>

<p>What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,</p>

<p>When this was now a king and now is clay?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind</p>

<p>To do the office for thee of revenge,</p>

<p>And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,</p>

<p>As it on Earth hath been thy servant still.–</p>

<p>Now, now, you stars, that move in your right spheres,</p>

<p>Where be your powers? Show now your mended</p>

<p>faiths</p>

<p>And instantly return with me again</p>

<p>To push destruction and perpetual shame</p>

<p>Out of the weak door of our fainting land.</p>

<p>Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;</p>

<p>The Dauphin rages at our very heels.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>It seems you know not, then, so much as we.</p>

<p>The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,</p>

<p>Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,</p>

<p>And brings from him such offers of our peace</p>

<p>As we with honor and respect may take,</p>

<p>With purpose presently to leave this war.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>He will the rather do it when he sees</p>

<p>Ourselves well-sinewed to our defense.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Nay, ’tis in a manner done already,</p>

<p>For many carriages he hath dispatched</p>

<p>To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel</p>

<p>To the disposing of the Cardinal,</p>

<p>With whom yourself, myself, and other lords,</p>

<p>If you think meet, this afternoon will post</p>

<p>To consummate this business happily.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Let it be so.–And you, my noble prince,</p>

<p>With other princes that may best be spared,</p>

<p>Shall wait upon your father’s funeral.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>At Worcester must his body be interred,</p>

<p>For so he willed it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span>  Thither shall it, then,</p>

<p>And happily may your sweet self put on</p>

<p>The lineal state and glory of the land,</p>

<p>To whom with all submission on my knee</p>

<p>I do bequeath my faithful services</p>

<p>And true subjection everlastingly.     <i><i>[He kneels.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>And the like tender of our love we make</p>

<p>To rest without a spot forevermore.</p>

<p><center><i>[Salisbury, Pembroke, and Bigot kneel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>I have a kind soul that would give you thanks</p>

<p>And knows not how to do it but with tears.</p>

<p><center><i>[They rise.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>O, let us pay the time but needful woe,</p>

<p>Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.</p>

<p>This England never did nor never shall</p>

<p>Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror</p>

<p>But when it first did help to wound itself.</p>

<p>Now these her princes are come home again,</p>

<p>Come the three corners of the world in arms</p>

<p>And we shall shock them. Naught shall make us rue,</p>

<p>If England to itself do rest but true.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit, bearing the body of King John.]</i></center></p>
