<p><center><i>[Enter Arthur on the walls, dressed as a shipboy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>The wall is high, and yet will I leap down.</p>

<p>Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not.</p>

<p>There’s few or none do know me. If they did,</p>

<p>This shipboy’s semblance hath disguised me quite.</p>

<p>I am afraid, and yet I’ll venture it.</p>

<p>If I get down and do not break my limbs,</p>

<p>I’ll find a thousand shifts to get away.</p>

<p>As good to die and go as die and stay.</p>

<p><center><i>[He jumps.]</i></center></p>

<p>O me, my uncle’s spirit is in these stones.</p>

<p>Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones.</p>

<p><center><i>[He dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pembroke, Salisbury with a letter, and Bigot.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury;</p>

<p>It is our safety, and we must embrace</p>

<p>This gentle offer of the perilous time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pembroke</span></p>

<p>Who brought that letter from the Cardinal?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,</p>

<p>Whose private with me of the Dauphin’s love</p>

<p>Is much more general than these lines import.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bigot</span></p>

<p>Tomorrow morning let us meet him, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Or rather then set forward, for ’twill be</p>

<p>Two long days’ journey, lords, or ere we meet.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bastard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Once more today well met, distempered lords.</p>

<p>The King by me requests your presence straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>The King hath dispossessed himself of us.</p>

<p>We will not line his thin bestained cloak</p>

<p>With our pure honors, nor attend the foot</p>

<p>That leaves the print of blood where’er it walks.</p>

<p>Return, and tell him so. We know the worst.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Whate’er you think, good words I think were best.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Our griefs and not our manners reason now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>But there is little reason in your grief.</p>

<p>Therefore ’twere reason you had manners now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pembroke</span></p>

<p>Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>’Tis true, to hurt his master, no man’s else.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>This is the prison.</p>

<p><center><i>[He sees Arthur’s body.]</i></center></p>

<p>What is he lies here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pembroke</span></p>

<p>O Death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!</p>

<p>The Earth had not a hole to hide this deed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Murder, as hating what himself hath done,</p>

<p>Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bigot</span></p>

<p>Or when he doomed this beauty to a grave,</p>

<p>Found it too precious-princely for a grave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span> <i>[to Bastard]</i></p>

<p>Sir Richard, what think you? You have beheld.</p>

<p>Or have you read or heard, or could you think,</p>

<p>Or do you almost think, although you see,</p>

<p>That you do see? Could thought, without this object,</p>

<p>Form such another? This is the very top,</p>

<p>The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,</p>

<p>Of murder’s arms. This is the bloodiest shame,</p>

<p>The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke</p>

<p>That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage</p>

<p>Presented to the tears of soft remorse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pembroke</span></p>

<p>All murders past do stand excused in this.</p>

<p>And this, so sole and so unmatchable,</p>

<p>Shall give a holiness, a purity,</p>

<p>To the yet unbegotten sin of times</p>

<p>And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,</p>

<p>Exampled by this heinous spectacle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>It is a damned and a bloody work,</p>

<p>The graceless action of a heavy hand,</p>

<p>If that it be the work of any hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>If that it be the work of any hand?</p>

<p>We had a kind of light what would ensue.</p>

<p>It is the shameful work of Hubert’s hand,</p>

<p>The practice and the purpose of the King,</p>

<p>From whose obedience I forbid my soul,</p>

<p>Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life     <i><i>[He kneels.]</i></i></p>

<p>And breathing to his breathless excellence</p>

<p>The incense of a vow, a holy vow:</p>

<p>Never to taste the pleasures of the world,</p>

<p>Never to be infected with delight,</p>

<p>Nor conversant with ease and idleness,</p>

<p>Till I have set a glory to this hand</p>

<p>By giving it the worship of revenge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pembroke</span> <span class='sc'>Bigot</span> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Our souls religiously confirm thy words.</p>

<p><center><i>[They rise.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hubert.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you.</p>

<p>Arthur doth live; the King hath sent for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>O, he is bold and blushes not at death!–</p>

<p>Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>I am no villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span> <i>[drawing his sword]</i>  Must I rob the law?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Your sword is bright, sir. Put it up again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Not till I sheathe it in a murderer’s skin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say.</p>

<p>By heaven, I think my sword’s as sharp as yours.</p>

<p><center><i>[He puts his hand on his sword.]</i></center></p>

<p>I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,</p>

<p>Nor tempt the danger of my true defense,</p>

<p>Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget</p>

<p>Your worth, your greatness, and nobility.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bigot</span></p>

<p>Out, dunghill! Dar’st thou brave a nobleman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Not for my life. But yet I dare defend</p>

<p>My innocent life against an emperor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Thou art a murderer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span>  Do not prove me so.</p>

<p>Yet I am none. Whose tongue soe’er speaks false,</p>

<p>Not truly speaks. Who speaks not truly, lies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pembroke</span> <i>[drawing his sword]</i></p>

<p>Cut him to pieces.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span> <i>[drawing his sword]</i>  Keep the peace, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury.</p>

<p>If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,</p>

<p>Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,</p>

<p>I’ll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime,</p>

<p>Or I’ll so maul you and your toasting-iron</p>

<p>That you shall think the devil is come from hell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bigot</span></p>

<p>What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?</p>

<p>Second a villain and a murderer?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Lord Bigot, I am none.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bigot</span>  Who killed this prince?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>’Tis not an hour since I left him well.</p>

<p>I honored him, I loved him, and will weep</p>

<p>My date of life out for his sweet life’s loss.</p>

<p><center><i>[He weeps.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,</p>

<p>For villainy is not without such rheum,</p>

<p>And he, long traded in it, makes it seem</p>

<p>like rivers of remorse and innocency.</p>

<p>Away with me, all you whose souls abhor</p>

<p>Th’ uncleanly savors of a slaughterhouse,</p>

<p>For I am stifled with this smell of sin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bigot</span></p>

<p>Away, toward Bury, to the Dauphin there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pembroke</span></p>

<p>There, tell the King, he may inquire us out.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lords exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Here’s a good world! Knew you of this fair work?</p>

<p>Beyond the infinite and boundless reach</p>

<p>Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,</p>

<p>Art thou damned, Hubert.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span>  Do but hear me, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span>  Ha! I’ll tell thee what.</p>

<p>Thou ’rt damned as black–nay, nothing is so black–</p>

<p>Thou art more deep damned than Prince Lucifer.</p>

<p>There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell</p>

<p>As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Upon my soul–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span>  If thou didst but consent</p>

<p>To this most cruel act, do but despair,</p>

<p>And if thou want’st a cord, the smallest thread</p>

<p>That ever spider twisted from her womb</p>

<p>Will serve to strangle thee; a rush will be a beam</p>

<p>To hang thee on. Or wouldst thou drown thyself,</p>

<p>Put but a little water in a spoon</p>

<p>And it shall be as all the ocean,</p>

<p>Enough to stifle such a villain up.</p>

<p>I do suspect thee very grievously.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>If I in act, consent, or sin of thought</p>

<p>Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath</p>

<p>Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,</p>

<p>Let hell want pains enough to torture me.</p>

<p>I left him well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span>  Go, bear him in thine arms.</p>

<p>I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way</p>

<p>Among the thorns and dangers of this world.</p>

<p><center><i>[Hubert takes up Arthur’s body.]</i></center></p>

<p>How easy dost thou take all England up!</p>

<p>From forth this morsel of dead royalty,</p>

<p>The life, the right, and truth of all this realm</p>

<p>Is fled to heaven, and England now is left</p>

<p>To tug and scamble and to part by th’ teeth</p>

<p>The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.</p>

<p>Now for the bare-picked bone of majesty</p>

<p>Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest</p>

<p>And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace.</p>

<p>Now powers from home and discontents at home</p>

<p>Meet in one line, and vast confusion waits,</p>

<p>As doth a raven on a sick-fall’n beast,</p>

<p>The imminent decay of wrested pomp.</p>

<p>Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can</p>

<p>Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child,</p>

<p>And follow me with speed. I’ll to the King.</p>

<p>A thousand businesses are brief in hand,</p>

<p>And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit, with Hubert carrying Arthur’s body.]</i></center></p>
