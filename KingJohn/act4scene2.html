<p><center><i>[Enter King John, Pembroke, Salisbury, and other</p>

<p>Lords. King John ascends the throne.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Here once again we sit, once again crowned</p>

<p>And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pembroke</sc></p>

<p>This “once again,” but that your Highness pleased,</p>

<p>Was once superfluous. You were crowned before,</p>

<p>And that high royalty was ne’er plucked off,</p>

<p>The faiths of men ne’er stained with revolt;</p>

<p>Fresh expectation troubled not the land</p>

<p>With any longed-for change or better state.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>Therefore, to be possessed with double pomp,</p>

<p>To guard a title that was rich before,</p>

<p>To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,</p>

<p>To throw a perfume on the violet,</p>

<p>To smooth the ice or add another hue</p>

<p>Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light</p>

<p>To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,</p>

<p>Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pembroke</sc></p>

<p>But that your royal pleasure must be done,</p>

<p>This act is as an ancient tale new told,</p>

<p>And, in the last repeating, troublesome,</p>

<p>Being urged at a time unseasonable.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>In this the antique and well-noted face</p>

<p>Of plain old form is much disfigured,</p>

<p>And like a shifted wind unto a sail,</p>

<p>It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,</p>

<p>Startles and frights consideration,</p>

<p>Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected</p>

<p>For putting on so new a fashioned robe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pembroke</sc></p>

<p>When workmen strive to do better than well,</p>

<p>They do confound their skill in covetousness,</p>

<p>And oftentimes excusing of a fault</p>

<p>Doth make the fault the worse by th’ excuse,</p>

<p>As patches set upon a little breach</p>

<p>Discredit more in hiding of the fault</p>

<p>Than did the fault before it was so patched.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>To this effect, before you were new-crowned,</p>

<p>We breathed our counsel; but it pleased your</p>

<p>Highness</p>

<p>To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,</p>

<p>Since all and every part of what we would</p>

<p>Doth make a stand at what your Highness will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Some reasons of this double coronation</p>

<p>I have possessed you with, and think them strong;</p>

<p>And more, more strong, when lesser is my fear,</p>

<p>I shall endue you with. Meantime, but ask</p>

<p>What you would have reformed that is not well,</p>

<p>And well shall you perceive how willingly</p>

<p>I will both hear and grant you your requests.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pembroke</sc></p>

<p>Then I, as one that am the tongue of these</p>

<p>To sound the purposes of all their hearts,</p>

<p>Both for myself and them, but chief of all</p>

<p>Your safety, for the which myself and them</p>

<p>Bend their best studies, heartily request</p>

<p>Th’ enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint</p>

<p>Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent</p>

<p>To break into this dangerous argument:</p>

<p>If what in rest you have in right you hold,</p>

<p>Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend</p>

<p>The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up</p>

<p>Your tender kinsman and to choke his days</p>

<p>With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth</p>

<p>The rich advantage of good exercise.</p>

<p>That the time’s enemies may not have this</p>

<p>To grace occasions, let it be our suit</p>

<p>That you have bid us ask, his liberty,</p>

<p>Which for our goods we do no further ask</p>

<p>Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,</p>

<p>Counts it your weal he have his liberty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Let it be so. I do commit his youth</p>

<p>To your direction.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hubert.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Hubert, what news with you?</p>

<p><center><i>[King John and Hubert talk aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pembroke</sc></p>

<p>This is the man should do the bloody deed.</p>

<p>He showed his warrant to a friend of mine.</p>

<p>The image of a wicked heinous fault</p>

<p>Lives in his eye. That close aspect of his</p>

<p>Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast,</p>

<p>And I do fearfully believe ’tis done</p>

<p>What we so feared he had a charge to do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>The color of the King doth come and go</p>

<p>Between his purpose and his conscience,</p>

<p>Like heralds ’twixt two dreadful battles set.</p>

<p>His passion is so ripe it needs must break.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pembroke</sc></p>

<p>And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence</p>

<p>The foul corruption of a sweet child’s death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc> <i>[coming forward with Hubert]</i></p>

<p>We cannot hold mortality’s strong hand.–</p>

<p>Good lords, although my will to give is living,</p>

<p>The suit which you demand is gone and dead.</p>

<p>He tells us Arthur is deceased tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>Indeed, we feared his sickness was past cure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pembroke</sc></p>

<p>Indeed, we heard how near his death he was</p>

<p>Before the child himself felt he was sick.</p>

<p>This must be answered either here or hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?</p>

<p>Think you I bear the shears of destiny?</p>

<p>Have I commandment on the pulse of life?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>It is apparent foul play, and ’tis shame</p>

<p>That greatness should so grossly offer it.</p>

<p>So thrive it in your game, and so farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pembroke</sc></p>

<p>Stay yet, Lord Salisbury. I’ll go with thee</p>

<p>And find th’ inheritance of this poor child,</p>

<p>His little kingdom of a forced grave.</p>

<p>That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,</p>

<p>Three foot of it doth hold. Bad world the while!</p>

<p>This must not be thus borne; this will break out</p>

<p>To all our sorrows, and ere long, I doubt.</p>

<p><center><i>[Pembroke, Salisbury, and other Lords exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>They burn in indignation. I repent.</p>

<p>There is no sure foundation set on blood,</p>

<p>No certain life achieved by others’ death.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>A fearful eye thou hast. Where is that blood</p>

<p>That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?</p>

<p>So foul a sky clears not without a storm.</p>

<p>Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>From France to England. Never such a power</p>

<p>For any foreign preparation</p>

<p>Was levied in the body of a land.</p>

<p>The copy of your speed is learned by them,</p>

<p>For when you should be told they do prepare,</p>

<p>The tidings comes that they are all arrived.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?</p>

<p>Where hath it slept? Where is my mother’s care,</p>

<p>That such an army could be drawn in France</p>

<p>And she not hear of it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  My liege, her ear</p>

<p>Is stopped with dust. The first of April died</p>

<p>Your noble mother. And as I hear, my lord,</p>

<p>The Lady Constance in a frenzy died</p>

<p>Three days before. But this from rumor’s tongue</p>

<p>I idly heard. If true or false, I know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!</p>

<p>O, make a league with me till I have pleased</p>

<p>My discontented peers. What? Mother dead?</p>

<p>How wildly then walks my estate in France!–</p>

<p>Under whose conduct came those powers of France</p>

<p>That thou for truth giv’st out are landed here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Under the Dauphin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc>  Thou hast made me giddy</p>

<p>With these ill tidings.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bastard and Peter of Pomfret.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><i>[To Bastard.]</i> Now, what says the world</p>

<p>To your proceedings? Do not seek to stuff</p>

<p>My head with more ill news, for it is full.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>But if you be afeard to hear the worst,</p>

<p>Then let the worst, unheard, fall on your head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Bear with me, cousin, for I was amazed</p>

<p>Under the tide, but now I breathe again</p>

<p>Aloft the flood and can give audience</p>

<p>To any tongue, speak it of what it will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>How I have sped among the clergymen</p>

<p>The sums I have collected shall express.</p>

<p>But as I traveled hither through the land,</p>

<p>I find the people strangely fantasied,</p>

<p>Possessed with rumors, full of idle dreams,</p>

<p>Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear.</p>

<p>And here’s a prophet that I brought with me</p>

<p>From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found</p>

<p>With many hundreds treading on his heels,</p>

<p>To whom he sung in rude harsh-sounding rhymes</p>

<p>That ere the next Ascension Day at noon,</p>

<p>Your Highness should deliver up your crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc> <i>[to Peter]</i></p>

<p>Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Peter</sc></p>

<p>Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Hubert, away with him! Imprison him.</p>

<p>And on that day at noon, whereon he says</p>

<p>I shall yield up my crown, let him be hanged.</p>

<p>Deliver him to safety and return,</p>

<p>For I must use thee.     <i><i>[Hubert and Peter exit.]</i></i></p>

<p>O my gentle cousin,</p>

<p>Hear’st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>The French, my lord. Men’s mouths are full of it.</p>

<p>Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury</p>

<p>With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,</p>

<p>And others more, going to seek the grave</p>

<p>Of Arthur, whom they say is killed tonight</p>

<p>On your suggestion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc>  Gentle kinsman, go</p>

<p>And thrust thyself into their companies.</p>

<p>I have a way to win their loves again.</p>

<p>Bring them before me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc>  I will seek them out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Nay, but make haste, the better foot before!</p>

<p>O, let me have no subject enemies</p>

<p>When adverse foreigners affright my towns</p>

<p>With dreadful pomp of stout invasion.</p>

<p>Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,</p>

<p>And fly like thought from them to me again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.</p>

<p><i>[To Messenger.]</i> Go after him, for he perhaps shall</p>

<p>need</p>

<p>Some messenger betwixt me and the peers,</p>

<p>And be thou he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  With all my heart, my liege.</p>

<p><center><i>[Messenger exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc>  My mother dead!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hubert.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hubert</sc></p>

<p>My lord, they say five moons were seen tonight–</p>

<p>Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about</p>

<p>The other four in wondrous motion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Five moons!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hubert</sc>  Old men and beldams in the streets</p>

<p>Do prophesy upon it dangerously.</p>

<p>Young Arthur’s death is common in their mouths,</p>

<p>And when they talk of him, they shake their heads</p>

<p>And whisper one another in the ear,</p>

<p>And he that speaks doth grip the hearer’s wrist,</p>

<p>Whilst he that hears makes fearful action</p>

<p>With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.</p>

<p>I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,</p>

<p>The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,</p>

<p>With open mouth swallowing a tailor’s news,</p>

<p>Who with his shears and measure in his hand,</p>

<p>Standing on slippers which his nimble haste</p>

<p>Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,</p>

<p>Told of a many thousand warlike French</p>

<p>That were embattled and ranked in Kent.</p>

<p>Another lean, unwashed artificer</p>

<p>Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur’s death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Why seek’st thou to possess me with these fears?</p>

<p>Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur’s death?</p>

<p>Thy hand hath murdered him. I had a mighty cause</p>

<p>To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hubert</sc></p>

<p>No had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>It is the curse of kings to be attended</p>

<p>By slaves that take their humors for a warrant</p>

<p>To break within the bloody house of life,</p>

<p>And on the winking of authority</p>

<p>To understand a law, to know the meaning</p>

<p>Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns</p>

<p>More upon humor than advised respect.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hubert</sc> <i>[showing a paper]</i></p>

<p>Here is your hand and seal for what I did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>O, when the last accompt twixt heaven and Earth</p>

<p>Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal</p>

<p>Witness against us to damnation!</p>

<p>How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds</p>

<p>Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,</p>

<p>A fellow by the hand of nature marked,</p>

<p>Quoted, and signed to do a deed of shame,</p>

<p>This murder had not come into my mind.</p>

<p>But taking note of thy abhorred aspect,</p>

<p>Finding thee fit for bloody villainy,</p>

<p>Apt, liable to be employed in danger,</p>

<p>I faintly broke with thee of Arthur’s death;</p>

<p>And thou, to be endeared to a king,</p>

<p>Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hubert</sc>  My lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause</p>

<p>When I spake darkly what I purposed,</p>

<p>Or turned an eye of doubt upon my face,</p>

<p>As bid me tell my tale in express words,</p>

<p>Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break</p>

<p>off,</p>

<p>And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me.</p>

<p>But thou didst understand me by my signs</p>

<p>And didst in signs again parley with sin,</p>

<p>Yea, without stop didst let thy heart consent</p>

<p>And consequently thy rude hand to act</p>

<p>The deed which both our tongues held vile to name.</p>

<p>Out of my sight, and never see me more.</p>

<p>My nobles leave me, and my state is braved,</p>

<p>Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers.</p>

<p>Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,</p>

<p>This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,</p>

<p>Hostility and civil tumult reigns</p>

<p>Between my conscience and my cousin’s death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hubert</sc></p>

<p>Arm you against your other enemies.</p>

<p>I’ll make a peace between your soul and you.</p>

<p>Young Arthur is alive. This hand of mine</p>

<p>Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,</p>

<p>Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.</p>

<p>Within this bosom never entered yet</p>

<p>The dreadful motion of a murderous thought,</p>

<p>And you have slandered nature in my form,</p>

<p>Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,</p>

<p>Is yet the cover of a fairer mind</p>

<p>Than to be butcher of an innocent child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,</p>

<p>Throw this report on their incensed rage,</p>

<p>And make them tame to their obedience.</p>

<p>Forgive the comment that my passion made</p>

<p>Upon thy feature, for my rage was blind,</p>

<p>And foul imaginary eyes of blood</p>

<p>Presented thee more hideous than thou art.</p>

<p>O, answer not, but to my closet bring</p>

<p>The angry lords with all expedient haste.</p>

<p>I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.</p>
