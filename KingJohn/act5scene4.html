<p><center><i>[Enter Salisbury, Pembroke, and Bigot.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>I did not think the King so stored with friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pembroke</sc></p>

<p>Up once again. Put spirit in the French.</p>

<p>If they miscarry, we miscarry too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,</p>

<p>In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pembroke</sc></p>

<p>They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Melun, wounded, led by a Soldier.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Melun</sc></p>

<p>Lead me to the revolts of England here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>When we were happy, we had other names.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pembroke</sc></p>

<p>It is the Count Melun.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc>  Wounded to death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Melun</sc></p>

<p>Fly, noble English; you are bought and sold.</p>

<p>Unthread the rude eye of rebellion</p>

<p>And welcome home again discarded faith.</p>

<p>Seek out King John and fall before his feet,</p>

<p>For if the French be lords of this loud day,</p>

<p>He means to recompense the pains you take</p>

<p>By cutting off your heads. Thus hath he sworn,</p>

<p>And I with him, and many more with me,</p>

<p>Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury,</p>

<p>Even on that altar where we swore to you</p>

<p>Dear amity and everlasting love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>May this be possible? May this be true?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Melun</sc></p>

<p>Have I not hideous death within my view,</p>

<p>Retaining but a quantity of life,</p>

<p>Which bleeds away even as a form of wax</p>

<p>Resolveth from his figure ’gainst the fire?</p>

<p>What in the world should make me now deceive,</p>

<p>Since I must lose the use of all deceit?</p>

<p>Why should I then be false, since it is true</p>

<p>That I must die here and live hence by truth?</p>

<p>I say again, if Louis do win the day,</p>

<p>He is forsworn if e’er those eyes of yours</p>

<p>Behold another daybreak in the East.</p>

<p>But even this night, whose black contagious breath</p>

<p>Already smokes about the burning crest</p>

<p>Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun,</p>

<p>Even this ill night your breathing shall expire,</p>

<p>Paying the fine of rated treachery</p>

<p>Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,</p>

<p>If Louis by your assistance win the day.</p>

<p>Commend me to one Hubert with your king;</p>

<p>The love of him, and this respect besides,</p>

<p>For that my grandsire was an Englishman,</p>

<p>Awakes my conscience to confess all this.</p>

<p>In lieu whereof, I pray you bear me hence</p>

<p>From forth the noise and rumor of the field,</p>

<p>Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts</p>

<p>In peace, and part this body and my soul</p>

<p>With contemplation and devout desires.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>We do believe thee, and beshrew my soul</p>

<p>But I do love the favor and the form</p>

<p>Of this most fair occasion, by the which</p>

<p>We will untread the steps of damned flight,</p>

<p>And like a bated and retired flood,</p>

<p>Leaving our rankness and irregular course,</p>

<p>Stoop low within those bounds we have o’erlooked</p>

<p>And calmly run on in obedience</p>

<p>Even to our ocean, to our great King John.</p>

<p>My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence,</p>

<p>For I do see the cruel pangs of death</p>

<p>Right in thine eye.–Away, my friends! New flight,</p>

<p>And happy newness, that intends old right.</p>
