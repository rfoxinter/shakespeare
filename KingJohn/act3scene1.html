<p><center><i>[Enter Constance, Arthur, and Salisbury.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc> <i>[to Salisbury]</i></p>

<p>Gone to be married? Gone to swear a peace?</p>

<p>False blood to false blood joined? Gone to be friends?</p>

<p>Shall Louis have Blanche and Blanche those</p>

<p>provinces?</p>

<p>It is not so. Thou hast misspoke, misheard.</p>

<p>Be well advised; tell o’er thy tale again.</p>

<p>It cannot be; thou dost but say ’tis so.</p>

<p>I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word</p>

<p>Is but the vain breath of a common man.</p>

<p>Believe me, I do not believe thee, man.</p>

<p>I have a king’s oath to the contrary.</p>

<p>Thou shalt be punished for thus flighting me,</p>

<p>For I am sick and capable of fears,</p>

<p>Oppressed with wrongs and therefore full of fears,</p>

<p>A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,</p>

<p>A woman naturally born to fears.</p>

<p>And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,</p>

<p>With my vexed spirits I cannot take a truce,</p>

<p>But they will quake and tremble all this day.</p>

<p>What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?</p>

<p>Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?</p>

<p>What means that hand upon that breast of thine?</p>

<p>Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,</p>

<p>Like a proud river peering o’er his bounds?</p>

<p>Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?</p>

<p>Then speak again–not all thy former tale,</p>

<p>But this one word, whether thy tale be true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>As true as I believe you think them false</p>

<p>That give you cause to prove my saying true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,</p>

<p>Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,</p>

<p>And let belief and life encounter so</p>

<p>As doth the fury of two desperate men</p>

<p>Which in the very meeting fall and die.</p>

<p>Louis marry Blanche?–O, boy, then where art</p>

<p>thou?–</p>

<p>France friend with England? What becomes of me?</p>

<p>Fellow, be gone. I cannot brook thy sight.</p>

<p>This news hath made thee a most ugly man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>What other harm have I, good lady, done</p>

<p>But spoke the harm that is by others done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Which harm within itself so heinous is</p>

<p>As it makes harmful all that speak of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arthur</sc></p>

<p>I do beseech you, madam, be content.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>If thou that bidd’st me be content wert grim,</p>

<p>Ugly, and sland’rous to thy mother’s womb,</p>

<p>Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,</p>

<p>Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,</p>

<p>Patched with foul moles and eye-offending marks,</p>

<p>I would not care; I then would be content,</p>

<p>For then I should not love thee; no, nor thou</p>

<p>Become thy great birth, nor deserve a crown.</p>

<p>But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,</p>

<p>Nature and Fortune joined to make thee great.</p>

<p>Of Nature’s gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,</p>

<p>And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,</p>

<p>She is corrupted, changed, and won from thee;</p>

<p>Sh’ adulterates hourly with thine Uncle John,</p>

<p>And with her golden hand hath plucked on France</p>

<p>To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,</p>

<p>And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.</p>

<p>France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,</p>

<p>That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John.–</p>

<p>Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?</p>

<p>Envenom him with words, or get thee gone</p>

<p>And leave those woes alone which I alone</p>

<p>Am bound to underbear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc>  Pardon me, madam,</p>

<p>I may not go without you to the Kings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Thou mayst, thou shalt, I will not go with thee.</p>

<p>I will instruct my sorrows to be proud,</p>

<p>For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.</p>

<p><center><i>[She sits down.]</i></center></p>

<p>To me and to the state of my great grief</p>

<p>Let kings assemble, for my grief ’s so great</p>

<p>That no supporter but the huge firm Earth</p>

<p>Can hold it up. Here I and sorrows sit.</p>

<p>Here is my throne; bid kings come bow to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King John, hand in hand with King Philip of</p>

<p>France, Louis the Dauphin, Blanche, Queen Eleanor,</p>

<p>Bastard, Austria, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc> <i>[to Blanche]</i></p>

<p>’Tis true, fair daughter, and this blessed day</p>

<p>Ever in France shall be kept festival.</p>

<p>To solemnize this day the glorious sun</p>

<p>Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,</p>

<p>Turning with splendor of his precious eye</p>

<p>The meager cloddy earth to glittering gold.</p>

<p>The yearly course that brings this day about</p>

<p>Shall never see it but a holy day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc> <i>[rising]</i></p>

<p>A wicked day, and not a holy day!</p>

<p>What hath this day deserved? What hath it done</p>

<p>That it in golden letters should be set</p>

<p>Among the high tides in the calendar?</p>

<p>Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,</p>

<p>This day of shame, oppression, perjury.</p>

<p>Or if it must stand still, let wives with child</p>

<p>Pray that their burdens may not fall this day,</p>

<p>Lest that their hopes prodigiously be crossed.</p>

<p>But on this day let seamen fear no wrack;</p>

<p>No bargains break that are not this day made;</p>

<p>This day, all things begun come to ill end,</p>

<p>Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause</p>

<p>To curse the fair proceedings of this day.</p>

<p>Have I not pawned to you my majesty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>You have beguiled me with a counterfeit</p>

<p>Resembling majesty, which, being touched and tried,</p>

<p>Proves valueless. You are forsworn, forsworn.</p>

<p>You came in arms to spill mine enemies’ blood,</p>

<p>But now in arms you strengthen it with yours.</p>

<p>The grappling vigor and rough frown of war</p>

<p>Is cold in amity and painted peace,</p>

<p>And our oppression hath made up this league.</p>

<p>Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured</p>

<p>kings!</p>

<p>A widow cries; be husband to me, God!</p>

<p>Let not the hours of this ungodly day</p>

<p>Wear out the days in peace, but ere sunset</p>

<p>Set armed discord ’twixt these perjured kings.</p>

<p>Hear me, O, hear me!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc>  Lady Constance, peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>War, war, no peace! Peace is to me a war.</p>

<p>O Limoges, O Austria, thou dost shame</p>

<p>That bloody spoil. Thou slave, thou wretch, thou</p>

<p>coward,</p>

<p>Thou little valiant, great in villainy,</p>

<p>Thou ever strong upon the stronger side,</p>

<p>Thou Fortune’s champion, that dost never fight</p>

<p>But when her humorous Ladyship is by</p>

<p>To teach thee safety. Thou art perjured too,</p>

<p>And sooth’st up greatness. What a fool art thou,</p>

<p>A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear</p>

<p>Upon my party. Thou cold-blooded slave,</p>

<p>Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side?</p>

<p>Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend</p>

<p>Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength?</p>

<p>And dost thou now fall over to my foes?</p>

<p>Thou wear a lion’s hide! Doff it for shame,</p>

<p>And hang a calfskin on those recreant limbs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc></p>

<p>O, that a man should speak those words to me!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>“And hang a calfskin on those recreant limbs.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc></p>

<p>Thou dar’st not say so, villain, for thy life!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>“And hang a calfskin on those recreant limbs.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>We like not this. Thou dost forget thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pandulph.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Here comes the holy legate of the Pope.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!</p>

<p>To thee, King John, my holy errand is.</p>

<p>I, Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal</p>

<p>And from Pope Innocent the legate here,</p>

<p>Do in his name religiously demand</p>

<p>Why thou against the Church, our holy mother,</p>

<p>So willfully dost spurn, and force perforce</p>

<p>Keep Stephen Langton, chosen Archbishop</p>

<p>Of Canterbury, from that Holy See.</p>

<p>This, in our foresaid Holy Father’s name,</p>

<p>Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>What earthy name to interrogatories</p>

<p>Can task the free breath of a sacred king?</p>

<p>Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name</p>

<p>So slight, unworthy, and ridiculous</p>

<p>To charge me to an answer, as the Pope.</p>

<p>Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England</p>

<p>Add thus much more, that no Italian priest</p>

<p>Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;</p>

<p>But as we under God are supreme head,</p>

<p>So, under Him, that great supremacy</p>

<p>Where we do reign we will alone uphold</p>

<p>Without th’ assistance of a mortal hand.</p>

<p>So tell the Pope, all reverence set apart</p>

<p>To him and his usurped authority.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Though you and all the kings of Christendom</p>

<p>Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,</p>

<p>Dreading the curse that money may buy out,</p>

<p>And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,</p>

<p>Purchase corrupted pardon of a man</p>

<p>Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,</p>

<p>Though you and all the rest, so grossly led,</p>

<p>This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,</p>

<p>Yet I alone, alone do me oppose</p>

<p>Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>Then, by the lawful power that I have,</p>

<p>Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate;</p>

<p>And blessed shall he be that doth revolt</p>

<p>From his allegiance to an heretic;</p>

<p>And meritorious shall that hand be called,</p>

<p>Canonized and worshiped as a saint,</p>

<p>That takes away by any secret course</p>

<p>Thy hateful life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc>  O, lawful let it be</p>

<p>That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!</p>

<p>Good father cardinal, cry thou “Amen”</p>

<p>To my keen curses, for without my wrong</p>

<p>There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>There’s law and warrant, lady, for my curse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>And for mine, too. When law can do no right,</p>

<p>Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong.</p>

<p>Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,</p>

<p>For he that holds his kingdom holds the law.</p>

<p>Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,</p>

<p>How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>Philip of France, on peril of a curse,</p>

<p>Let go the hand of that arch-heretic,</p>

<p>And raise the power of France upon his head</p>

<p>Unless he do submit himself to Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Eleanor</sc></p>

<p>Look’st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>Look to that, devil, lest that France repent</p>

<p>And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc></p>

<p>King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>And hang a calfskin on his recreant limbs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc></p>

<p>Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,</p>

<p>Because–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc>  Your breeches best may carry them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Philip, what sayst thou to the Cardinal?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>What should he say, but as the Cardinal?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Bethink you, father, for the difference</p>

<p>Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,</p>

<p>Or the light loss of England for a friend.</p>

<p>Forgo the easier.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blanche</sc>  That’s the curse of Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>O Louis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here</p>

<p>In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blanche</sc></p>

<p>The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,</p>

<p>But from her need.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc> <i>[to King Philip]</i></p>

<p>O, if thou grant my need,</p>

<p>Which only lives but by the death of faith,</p>

<p>That need must needs infer this principle:</p>

<p>That faith would live again by death of need.</p>

<p>O, then tread down my need, and faith mounts up;</p>

<p>Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>The King is moved, and answers not to this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc> <i>[to King Philip]</i></p>

<p>O, be removed from him, and answer well!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc></p>

<p>Do so, King Philip. Hang no more in doubt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>Hang nothing but a calfskin, most sweet lout.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>I am perplexed and know not what to say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,</p>

<p>If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>Good reverend father, make my person yours,</p>

<p>And tell me how you would bestow yourself.</p>

<p>This royal hand and mine are newly knit,</p>

<p>And the conjunction of our inward souls</p>

<p>Married, in league, coupled, and linked together</p>

<p>With all religious strength of sacred vows.</p>

<p>The latest breath that gave the sound of words</p>

<p>Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love</p>

<p>Between our kingdoms and our royal selves;</p>

<p>And even before this truce, but new before,</p>

<p>No longer than we well could wash our hands</p>

<p>To clap this royal bargain up of peace,</p>

<p>God knows they were besmeared and overstained</p>

<p>With slaughter’s pencil, where revenge did paint</p>

<p>The fearful difference of incensed kings.</p>

<p>And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,</p>

<p>So newly joined in love, so strong in both,</p>

<p>Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?</p>

<p>Play fast and loose with faith? So jest with heaven?</p>

<p>Make such unconstant children of ourselves</p>

<p>As now again to snatch our palm from palm,</p>

<p>Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage bed</p>

<p>Of smiling peace to march a bloody host</p>

<p>And make a riot on the gentle brow</p>

<p>Of true sincerity? O holy sir,</p>

<p>My reverend father, let it not be so!</p>

<p>Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose</p>

<p>Some gentle order, and then we shall be blest</p>

<p>To do your pleasure and continue friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>All form is formless, order orderless,</p>

<p>Save what is opposite to England’s love.</p>

<p>Therefore to arms! Be champion of our Church,</p>

<p>Or let the Church, our mother, breathe her curse,</p>

<p>A mother’s curse, on her revolting son.</p>

<p>France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,</p>

<p>A chafed lion by the mortal paw,</p>

<p>A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,</p>

<p>Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>

<p>I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>So mak’st thou faith an enemy to faith,</p>

<p>And like a civil war sett’st oath to oath,</p>

<p>Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow</p>

<p>First made to God, first be to God performed,</p>

<p>That is, to be the champion of our Church!</p>

<p>What since thou swor’st is sworn against thyself</p>

<p>And may not be performed by thyself,</p>

<p>For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss</p>

<p>Is not amiss when it is truly done;</p>

<p>And being not done where doing tends to ill,</p>

<p>The truth is then most done not doing it.</p>

<p>The better act of purposes mistook</p>

<p>Is to mistake again; though indirect,</p>

<p>Yet indirection thereby grows direct,</p>

<p>And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire</p>

<p>Within the scorched veins of one new-burned.</p>

<p>It is religion that doth make vows kept,</p>

<p>But thou hast sworn against religion</p>

<p>By what thou swear’st against the thing thou</p>

<p>swear’st,</p>

<p>And mak’st an oath the surety for thy truth</p>

<p>Against an oath. The truth thou art unsure</p>

<p>To swear swears only not to be forsworn,</p>

<p>Else what a mockery should it be to swear?</p>

<p>But thou dost swear only to be forsworn,</p>

<p>And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear.</p>

<p>Therefore thy later vows against thy first</p>

<p>Is in thyself rebellion to thyself.</p>

<p>And better conquest never canst thou make</p>

<p>Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts</p>

<p>Against these giddy loose suggestions,</p>

<p>Upon which better part our prayers come in,</p>

<p>If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know</p>

<p>The peril of our curses light on thee</p>

<p>So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,</p>

<p>But in despair die under their black weight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Austria</sc></p>

<p>Rebellion, flat rebellion!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc>  Will ’t not be?</p>

<p>Will not a calfskin stop that mouth of thine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Father, to arms!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blanche</sc>  Upon thy wedding day?</p>

<p>Against the blood that thou hast married?</p>

<p>What, shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men?</p>

<p>Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,</p>

<p>Clamors of hell, be measures to our pomp?</p>

<p><center><i>[She kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>O husband, hear me! Ay, alack, how new</p>

<p>Is “husband” in my mouth! Even for that name,</p>

<p>Which till this time my tongue did ne’er pronounce,</p>

<p>Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms</p>

<p>Against mine uncle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>O, upon my knee</p>

<p>Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,</p>

<p>Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom</p>

<p>Forethought by heaven!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blanche</sc> <i>[to Dauphin]</i></p>

<p>Now shall I see thy love. What motive may</p>

<p>Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constance</sc></p>

<p>That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,</p>

<p>His honor.–O, thine honor, Louis, thine honor!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc> <i>[to King Philip]</i></p>

<p>I muse your Majesty doth seem so cold,</p>

<p>When such profound respects do pull you on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandulph</sc></p>

<p>I will denounce a curse upon his head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc> <i>[dropping King John’s hand]</i></p>

<p>Thou shalt not need.–England, I will fall from</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,</p>

<p>Is it as he will? Well, then, France shall rue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Blanche</sc> <i>[rising]</i></p>

<p>The sun’s o’ercast with blood. Fair day, adieu.</p>

<p>Which is the side that I must go withal?</p>

<p>I am with both, each army hath a hand,</p>

<p>And in their rage, I having hold of both,</p>

<p>They whirl asunder and dismember me.</p>

<p>Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win.–</p>

<p>Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose.–</p>

<p>Father, I may not wish the fortune thine.–</p>

<p>Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive.</p>

<p>Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose.</p>

<p>Assured loss before the match be played.</p>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.</p>

<p>The blood, and dearest-valued blood, of France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Philip</sc></p>
