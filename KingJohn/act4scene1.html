<p><center><i>[Enter Hubert and Executioners, with irons and rope.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Heat me these irons hot, and look thou stand</p>

<p>Within the arras. When I strike my foot</p>

<p>Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth</p>

<p>And bind the boy which you shall find with me</p>

<p>Fast to the chair. Be heedful. Hence, and watch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Executioner</span></p>

<p>I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Uncleanly scruples fear not you. Look to ’t.</p>

<p><center><i>[Executioners exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Young lad, come forth. I have to say with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Arthur.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, Hubert.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span>  Good morrow, little prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>As little prince, having so great a title</p>

<p>To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Indeed, I have been merrier.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span>  Mercy on me!</p>

<p>Methinks nobody should be sad but I.</p>

<p>Yet I remember, when I was in France,</p>

<p>Young gentlemen would be as sad as night</p>

<p>Only for wantonness. By my christendom,</p>

<p>So I were out of prison and kept sheep,</p>

<p>I should be as merry as the day is long.</p>

<p>And so I would be here but that I doubt</p>

<p>My uncle practices more harm to me.</p>

<p>He is afraid of me, and I of him.</p>

<p>Is it my fault that I was Geoffrey’s son?</p>

<p>No, indeed, is ’t not. And I would to heaven</p>

<p>I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>If I talk to him, with his innocent prate</p>

<p>He will awake my mercy, which lies dead.</p>

<p>Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale today.</p>

<p>In sooth, I would you were a little sick</p>

<p>That I might sit all night and watch with you.</p>

<p>I warrant I love you more than you do me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>His words do take possession of my bosom.</p>

<p><center><i>[He shows Arthur a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>Read here, young Arthur. <i>[(Aside.)]</i> How now,</p>

<p>foolish rheum?</p>

<p>Turning dispiteous torture out of door?</p>

<p>I must be brief lest resolution drop</p>

<p>Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.–</p>

<p>Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.</p>

<p>Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Young boy, I must.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span>  And will you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span>  And I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,</p>

<p>I knit my handkercher about your brows–</p>

<p>The best I had, a princess wrought it me–</p>

<p>And I did never ask it you again;</p>

<p>And with my hand at midnight held your head,</p>

<p>And like the watchful minutes to the hour</p>

<p>Still and anon cheered up the heavy time,</p>

<p>Saying “What lack you?” and “Where lies your</p>

<p>grief?”</p>

<p>Or “What good love may I perform for you?”</p>

<p>Many a poor man’s son would have lien still</p>

<p>And ne’er have spoke a loving word to you;</p>

<p>But you at your sick service had a prince.</p>

<p>Nay, you may think my love was crafty love,</p>

<p>And call it cunning. Do, an if you will.</p>

<p>If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,</p>

<p>Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes–</p>

<p>These eyes that never did nor never shall</p>

<p>So much as frown on you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span>  I have sworn to do it.</p>

<p>And with hot irons must I burn them out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>Ah, none but in this Iron Age would do it.</p>

<p>The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,</p>

<p>Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears</p>

<p>And quench this fiery indignation</p>

<p>Even in the matter of mine innocence;</p>

<p>Nay, after that, consume away in rust</p>

<p>But for containing fire to harm mine eye.</p>

<p>Are you more stubborn-hard than hammered iron?</p>

<p>An if an angel should have come to me</p>

<p>And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,</p>

<p>I would not have believed him. No tongue but</p>

<p>Hubert’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span> <i>[stamps his foot and calls]</i>  Come forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Executioners with ropes, a heated iron, and a</p>

<p>brazier of burning coals.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Do as I bid you do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out</p>

<p>Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.</p>

<p><center><i>[He takes the iron.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>Alas, what need you be so boist’rous-rough?</p>

<p>I will not struggle; I will stand stone-still.</p>

<p>For God’s sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!</p>

<p>Nay, hear me, Hubert! Drive these men away,</p>

<p>And I will sit as quiet as a lamb.</p>

<p>I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word</p>

<p>Nor look upon the iron angerly.</p>

<p>Thrust but these men away, and I’ll forgive you,</p>

<p>Whatever torment you do put me to.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span> <i>[to Executioners]</i></p>

<p>Go stand within. Let me alone with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Executioner</span></p>

<p>I am best pleased to be from such a deed.</p>

<p><center><i>[Executioners exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>Alas, I then have chid away my friend!</p>

<p>He hath a stern look but a gentle heart.</p>

<p>Let him come back, that his compassion may</p>

<p>Give life to yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span>  Come, boy, prepare yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>Is there no remedy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span>  None but to lose your eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>O God, that there were but a mote in yours,</p>

<p>A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,</p>

<p>Any annoyance in that precious sense.</p>

<p>Then, feeling what small things are boisterous</p>

<p>there,</p>

<p>Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues</p>

<p>Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes.</p>

<p>Let me not hold my tongue. Let me not, Hubert,</p>

<p>Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,</p>

<p>So I may keep mine eyes. O, spare mine eyes,</p>

<p>Though to no use but still to look on you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He seizes the iron.]</i></center></p>

<p>Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold,</p>

<p>And would not harm me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span> <i>[taking back the iron]</i></p>

<p>I can heat it, boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>No, in good sooth. The fire is dead with grief,</p>

<p>Being create for comfort, to be used</p>

<p>In undeserved extremes. See else yourself.</p>

<p>There is no malice in this burning coal.</p>

<p>The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out</p>

<p>And strewed repentant ashes on his head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>But with my breath I can revive it, boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>An if you do, you will but make it blush</p>

<p>And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert.</p>

<p>Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes,</p>

<p>And, like a dog that is compelled to fight,</p>

<p>Snatch at his master that doth tar him on.</p>

<p>All things that you should use to do me wrong</p>

<p>Deny their office. Only you do lack</p>

<p>That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,</p>

<p>Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Well, see to live. I will not touch thine eye</p>

<p>For all the treasure that thine uncle owes.</p>

<p>Yet am I sworn, and I did purpose, boy,</p>

<p>With this same very iron to burn them out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span></p>

<p>O, now you look like Hubert. All this while</p>

<p>You were disguised.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span>  Peace. No more. Adieu.</p>

<p>Your uncle must not know but you are dead.</p>

<p>I’ll fill these dogged spies with false reports.</p>

<p>And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure</p>

<p>That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,</p>

<p>Will not offend thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arthur</span>  O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hubert</span></p>

<p>Silence. No more. Go closely in with me.</p>

<p>Much danger do I undergo for thee.</p>
