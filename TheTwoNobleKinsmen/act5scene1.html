<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter Theseus, Pirithous, Hippolyta,</p>

<p>and Attendants. Three altars set up onstage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>Now let ’em enter and before the gods</p>

<p>Tender their holy prayers. Let the temples</p>

<p>Burn bright with sacred fires, and the altars</p>

<p>In hallowed clouds commend their swelling incense</p>

<p>To those above us. Let no due be wanting.</p>

<p>They have a noble work in hand will honor</p>

<p>The very powers that love ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span>  Sir, they enter.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Flourish of cornets. Enter Palamon and Arcite</p>

<p>and their Knights.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>You valiant and strong-hearted enemies,</p>

<p>You royal german foes, that this day come</p>

<p>To blow that nearness out that flames between you,</p>

<p>Lay by your anger for an hour and, dove-like,</p>

<p>Before the holy altars of your helpers,</p>

<p>The all-feared gods, bow down your stubborn</p>

<p>bodies.</p>

<p>Your ire is more than mortal; so your help be.</p>

<p>And as the gods regard you, fight with justice.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you to your prayers, and betwixt you</p>

<p>I part my wishes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span>  Honor crown the worthiest!</p>

<p><center><i>[Theseus and his train exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>The glass is running now that cannot finish</p>

<p>Till one of us expire. Think you but thus,</p>

<p>That were there aught in me which strove to show</p>

<p>Mine enemy in this business, were ’t one eye</p>

<p>Against another, arm oppressed by arm,</p>

<p>I would destroy th’ offender, coz–I would</p>

<p>Though parcel of myself. Then from this gather</p>

<p>How I should tender you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  I am in labor</p>

<p>To push your name, your ancient love, our kindred</p>

<p>Out of my memory, and i’ th’ selfsame place</p>

<p>To seat something I would confound. So hoist we</p>

<p>The sails that must these vessels port even where</p>

<p>The heavenly Limiter pleases.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  You speak well.</p>

<p>Before I turn, let me embrace thee, cousin.</p>

<p><center><i>[They embrace.]</i></center></p>

<p>This I shall never do again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  One farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>Why, let it be so. Farewell, coz.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Farewell, sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[Palamon and his Knights exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Knights, kinsmen, lovers, yea, my sacrifices,</p>

<p>True worshippers of Mars, whose spirit in you</p>

<p>Expels the seeds of fear and th’ apprehension</p>

<p>Which still is father of it, go with me</p>

<p>Before the god of our profession. There</p>

<p>Require of him the hearts of lions and</p>

<p>The breath of tigers, yea, the fierceness too,</p>

<p>Yea, the speed also–to go on, I mean;</p>

<p>Else wish we to be snails. You know my prize</p>

<p>Must be dragged out of blood; force and great feat</p>

<p>Must put my garland on, where she sticks,</p>

<p>The queen of flowers. Our intercession, then,</p>

<p>Must be to him that makes the camp a cistern</p>

<p>Brimmed with the blood of men. Give me your aid,</p>

<p>And bend your spirits towards him.</p>

<p><center><i>[They go to Mars’s altar, fall on</p>

<p>their faces before it, and then kneel.]</i></center></p>

<p>Thou mighty one, that with thy power hast turned</p>

<p>Green Neptune into purple, whose approach</p>

<p>Comets prewarn, whose havoc in vast field</p>

<p>Unearthed skulls proclaim, whose breath blows</p>

<p>down</p>

<p>The teeming Ceres’ foison, who dost pluck</p>

<p>With hand armipotent from forth blue clouds</p>

<p>The masoned turrets, that both mak’st and break’st</p>

<p>The stony girths of cities; me thy pupil,</p>

<p>Youngest follower of thy drum, instruct this day</p>

<p>With military skill, that to thy laud</p>

<p>I may advance my streamer, and by thee</p>

<p>Be styled the lord o’ th’ day. Give me, great Mars,</p>

<p>Some token of thy pleasure.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here they fall on their faces as formerly, and</p>

<p>there is heard clanging of armor, with a short</p>

<p>thunder, as the burst of a battle, whereupon</p>

<p>they all rise and bow to the altar.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, great corrector of enormous times,</p>

<p>Shaker of o’er-rank states, thou grand decider</p>

<p>Of dusty and old titles, that heal’st with blood</p>

<p>The Earth when it is sick, and cur’st the world</p>

<p>O’ th’ pleurisy of people, I do take</p>

<p>Thy signs auspiciously, and in thy name</p>

<p>To my design march boldly.–Let us go.     <i><i>[They exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Palamon and his Knights,</p>

<p>with the former observance.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>Our stars must glister with new fire, or be</p>

<p>Today extinct. Our argument is love,</p>

<p>Which, if the goddess of it grant, she gives</p>

<p>Victory too. Then blend your spirits with mine,</p>

<p>You whose free nobleness do make my cause</p>

<p>Your personal hazard. To the goddess Venus</p>

<p>Commend we our proceeding, and implore</p>

<p>Her power unto our party.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here they go to Venus’s altar, fall on</p>

<p>their faces before it, and then kneel.]</i></center></p>

<p>Hail, sovereign queen of secrets, who hast power</p>

<p>To call the fiercest tyrant from his rage</p>

<p>And weep unto a girl; that hast the might</p>

<p>Even with an eye-glance to choke Mars’s drum</p>

<p>And turn th’ alarm to whispers; that canst make</p>

<p>A cripple flourish with his crutch, and cure him</p>

<p>Before Apollo; that mayst force the king</p>

<p>To be his subject’s vassal, and induce</p>

<p>Stale gravity to dance. The polled bachelor,</p>

<p>Whose youth, like wanton boys through bonfires,</p>

<p>Have skipped thy flame, at seventy thou canst catch,</p>

<p>And make him, to the scorn of his hoarse throat,</p>

<p>Abuse young lays of love. What godlike power</p>

<p>Hast thou not power upon? To Phoebus thou</p>

<p>Add’st flames hotter than his; the heavenly fires</p>

<p>Did scorch his mortal son, thine him. The huntress,</p>

<p>All moist and cold, some say, began to throw</p>

<p>Her bow away and sigh. Take to thy grace</p>

<p>Me, thy vowed soldier, who do bear thy yoke</p>

<p>As ’twere a wreath of roses, yet is heavier</p>

<p>Than lead itself, stings more than nettles.</p>

<p>I have never been foul-mouthed against thy law,</p>

<p>Ne’er revealed secret, for I knew none–would not,</p>

<p>Had I kenned all that were. I never practiced</p>

<p>Upon man’s wife, nor would the libels read</p>

<p>Of liberal wits. I never at great feasts</p>

<p>Sought to betray a beauty, but have blushed</p>

<p>At simp’ring sirs that did. I have been harsh</p>

<p>To large confessors, and have hotly asked them</p>

<p>If they had mothers–I had one, a woman,</p>

<p>And women ’twere they wronged. I knew a man</p>

<p>Of eighty winters–this I told them–who</p>

<p>A lass of fourteen brided; ’twas thy power</p>

<p>To put life into dust. The aged cramp</p>

<p>Had screwed his square foot round;</p>

<p>The gout had knit his fingers into knots;</p>

<p>Torturing convulsions from his globy eyes</p>

<p>Had almost drawn their spheres, that what was life</p>

<p>In him seemed torture. This anatomy</p>

<p>Had by his young fair fere a boy, and I</p>

<p>Believed it was his, for she swore it was,</p>

<p>And who would not believe her? Brief, I am</p>

<p>To those that prate and have done, no companion;</p>

<p>To those that boast and have not, a defier;</p>

<p>To those that would and cannot, a rejoicer.</p>

<p>Yea, him I do not love that tells close offices</p>

<p>The foulest way, nor names concealments in</p>

<p>The boldest language. Such a one I am,</p>

<p>And vow that lover never yet made sigh</p>

<p>Truer than I. O, then, most soft sweet goddess,</p>

<p>Give me the victory of this question, which</p>

<p>Is true love’s merit, and bless me with a sign</p>

<p>Of thy great pleasure.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here music is heard; doves are</p>

<p>seen to flutter. They fall again upon</p>

<p>their faces, then on their knees.]</i></center></p>

<p>O thou that from eleven to ninety reign’st</p>

<p>In mortal bosoms, whose chase is this world</p>

<p>And we in herds thy game, I give thee thanks</p>

<p>For this fair token, which being laid unto</p>

<p>Mine innocent true heart, arms in assurance</p>

<p>My body to this business.–Let us rise</p>

<p>And bow before the goddess.     <i><i>[They rise and bow.]</i></i></p>

<p>Time comes on.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Still music of recorders. Enter Emilia in white, her</p>

<p>hair about her shoulders, wearing a wheaten wreath;</p>

<p>one in white holding up her train, her hair stuck with</p>

<p>flowers; one before her carrying a silver hind, in which</p>

<p>is conveyed incense and sweet odors, which being</p>

<p>set upon the altar of Diana, her maids standing</p>

<p>aloof, she sets fire to it. Then they curtsy and kneel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span></p>

<p>O sacred, shadowy, cold, and constant queen,</p>

<p>Abandoner of revels, mute contemplative,</p>

<p>Sweet, solitary, white as chaste, and pure</p>

<p>As wind-fanned snow, who to thy female knights</p>

<p>Allow’st no more blood than will make a blush,</p>

<p>Which is their order’s robe, I here, thy priest,</p>

<p>Am humbled ’fore thine altar. O, vouchsafe</p>

<p>With that thy rare green eye, which never yet</p>

<p>Beheld thing maculate, look on thy virgin,</p>

<p>And, sacred silver mistress, lend thine ear–</p>

<p>Which ne’er heard scurrile term, into whose port</p>

<p>Ne’er entered wanton sound–to my petition,</p>

<p>Seasoned with holy fear. This is my last</p>

<p>Of vestal office. I am bride-habited</p>

<p>But maiden-hearted. A husband I have ’pointed,</p>

<p>But do not know him. Out of two I should</p>

<p>Choose one, and pray for his success, but I</p>

<p>Am guiltless of election. Of mine eyes,</p>

<p>Were I to lose one–they are equal precious–</p>

<p>I could doom neither; that which perished should</p>

<p>Go to ’t unsentenced. Therefore, most modest queen,</p>

<p>He of the two pretenders that best loves me</p>

<p>And has the truest title in ’t, let him</p>

<p>Take off my wheaten garland, or else grant</p>

<p>The file and quality I hold I may</p>

<p>Continue in thy band.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here the hind vanishes under the</p>

<p>altar, and in the place ascends a rose</p>

<p>tree, having one rose upon it.]</i></center></p>

<p>See what our general of ebbs and flows</p>

<p>Out from the bowels of her holy altar</p>

<p>With sacred act advances: but one rose.</p>

<p>If well inspired, this battle shall confound</p>

<p>Both these brave knights, and I, a virgin flower,</p>

<p>Must grow alone unplucked.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here is heard a sudden twang of instruments,</p>

<p>and the rose falls from the tree.]</i></center></p>

<p>The flower is fall’n, the tree descends. O mistress,</p>

<p>Thou here dischargest me. I shall be gathered;</p>

<p>I think so, but I know not thine own will.</p>

<p>Unclasp thy mystery!–I hope she’s pleased;</p>

<p>Her signs were gracious.</p>

<p><center><i>[They curtsy and exit.]</i></center></p>
