<p><center><i>[Enter Jailer and his Friend.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span></p>

<p>Heard you no more? Was nothing said of me</p>

<p>Concerning the escape of Palamon?</p>

<p>Good sir, remember!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Nothing that I heard,</p>

<p>For I came home before the business</p>

<p>Was fully ended. Yet I might perceive,</p>

<p>Ere I departed, a great likelihood</p>

<p>Of both their pardons; for Hippolyta</p>

<p>And fair-eyed Emily, upon their knees,</p>

<p>Begged with such handsome pity that the Duke,</p>

<p>Methought, stood staggering whether he should</p>

<p>follow</p>

<p>His rash oath or the sweet compassion</p>

<p>Of those two ladies. And, to second them,</p>

<p>That truly noble prince, Pirithous–</p>

<p>Half his own heart–set in too, that I hope</p>

<p>All shall be well. Neither heard I one question</p>

<p>Of your name or his ’scape.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  Pray heaven it hold so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Second Friend.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span></p>

<p>Be of good comfort, man; I bring you news,</p>

<p>Good news.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  They are welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Palamon has cleared</p>

<p>you</p>

<p>And got your pardon, and discovered how</p>

<p>And by whose means he escaped, which was your</p>

<p>daughter’s,</p>

<p>Whose pardon is procured too; and the prisoner,</p>

<p>Not to be held ungrateful to her goodness,</p>

<p>Has given a sum of money to her marriage–</p>

<p>A large one, I’ll assure you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  You are a good man</p>

<p>And ever bring good news.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  How was it ended?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span></p>

<p>Why, as it should be: they that ne’er begged</p>

<p>But they prevailed had their suits fairly granted;</p>

<p>The prisoners have their lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  I knew ’twould be so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span></p>

<p>But there be new conditions, which you’ll hear of</p>

<p>At better time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  I hope they are good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  They are</p>

<p>honorable;</p>

<p>How good they’ll prove I know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  ’Twill be known.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Wooer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span></p>

<p>Alas, sir, where’s your daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  Why do you ask?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span></p>

<p>O, sir, when did you see her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span> <i>[aside]</i>  How he looks!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span></p>

<p>This morning.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span>  Was she well? Was she in health?</p>

<p>Sir, when did she sleep?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span> <i>[aside]</i>  These are strange questions.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span></p>

<p>I do not think she was very well–for now</p>

<p>You make me mind her; but this very day</p>

<p>I asked her questions, and she answered me</p>

<p>So far from what she was, so childishly,</p>

<p>So sillily, as if she were a fool,</p>

<p>An innocent, and I was very angry.</p>

<p>But what of her, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span>  Nothing but my pity;</p>

<p>But you must know it, and as good by me</p>

<p>As by another that less loves her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  Well, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span></p>

<p>No, sir, not well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Not right?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Not well?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span></p>

<p>’Tis too true; she is mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  It cannot be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span></p>

<p>Believe you’ll find it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  I half suspected</p>

<p>What you told me. The gods comfort her!</p>

<p>Either this was her love to Palamon,</p>

<p>Or fear of my miscarrying on his ’scape,</p>

<p>Or both.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span>  ’Tis likely.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  But why all this haste, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span></p>

<p>I’ll tell you quickly. As I late was angling</p>

<p>In the great lake that lies behind the palace,</p>

<p>From the far shore–thick set with reeds and</p>

<p>sedges–</p>

<p>As patiently I was attending sport,</p>

<p>I heard a voice, a shrill one; and, attentive,</p>

<p>I gave my ear, when I might well perceive</p>

<p>’Twas one that sung, and by the smallness of it</p>

<p>A boy or woman. I then left my angle</p>

<p>To his own skill, came near, but yet perceived not</p>

<p>Who made the sound, the rushes and the reeds</p>

<p>Had so encompassed it. I laid me down</p>

<p>And listened to the words she sung, for then,</p>

<p>Through a small glade cut by the fishermen,</p>

<p>I saw it was your daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  Pray go on, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span></p>

<p>She sung much, but no sense; only I heard her</p>

<p>Repeat this often: “Palamon is gone,</p>

<p>Is gone to th’ wood to gather mulberries;</p>

<p>I’ll find him out tomorrow.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Pretty soul!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span></p>

<p>“His shackles will betray him; he’ll be taken,</p>

<p>And what shall I do then? I’ll bring a bevy,</p>

<p>A hundred black-eyed maids that love as I do,</p>

<p>With chaplets on their heads of daffadillies,</p>

<p>With cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses,</p>

<p>And all we’ll dance an antic ’fore the Duke,</p>

<p>And beg his pardon.” Then she talked of you, sir–</p>

<p>That you must lose your head tomorrow morning,</p>

<p>And she must gather flowers to bury you,</p>

<p>And see the house made handsome. Then she sung</p>

<p>Nothing but “Willow, willow, willow,” and between</p>

<p>Ever was “Palamon, fair Palamon,”</p>

<p>And “Palamon was a tall young man.” The place</p>

<p>Was knee-deep where she sat; her careless tresses,</p>

<p>A wreath of bulrush rounded; about her stuck</p>

<p>Thousand freshwater flowers of several colors,</p>

<p>That methought she appeared like the fair nymph</p>

<p>That feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris</p>

<p>Newly dropped down from heaven. Rings she made</p>

<p>Of rushes that grew by, and to ’em spoke</p>

<p>The prettiest posies: “Thus our true love’s tied,”</p>

<p>“This you may lose, not me,” and many a one;</p>

<p>And then she wept, and sung again, and sighed,</p>

<p>And with the same breath smiled and kissed her</p>

<p>hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span></p>

<p>Alas, what pity it is!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span>  I made in to her.</p>

<p>She saw me, and straight sought the flood. I saved</p>

<p>her</p>

<p>And set her safe to land, when presently</p>

<p>She slipped away, and to the city made</p>

<p>With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,</p>

<p>She left me far behind her. Three or four</p>

<p>I saw from far off cross her–one of ’em</p>

<p>I knew to be your brother–where she stayed</p>

<p>And fell, scarce to be got away. I left them with her</p>

<p>And hither came to tell you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Jailer’s Brother, Jailer’s Daughter, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here they are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>May you never more enjoy the light, etc.</i></p>

<p>Is not this a fine song?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brother</span>  O, a very fine one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  I can sing twenty more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brother</span>  I think you can.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  Yes, truly can I. I can sing “The Broom”</p>

<p>and “Bonny Robin.” Are not you a tailor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brother</span>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  Where’s my wedding gown?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brother</span>  I’ll bring it tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  Do, very rarely, I must be abroad else to</p>

<p>call the maids and pay the minstrels, for I must</p>

<p>lose my maidenhead by cocklight. ’Twill never</p>

<p>thrive else.</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>O fair, O sweet, etc.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brother</span> <i>[to Jailer]</i>  You must e’en take it patiently.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  ’Tis true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  Good e’en, good men. Pray, did you ever</p>

<p>hear of one young Palamon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  Yes, wench, we know him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  Is ’t not a fine young gentleman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  ’Tis, love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brother</span> <i>[aside to others]</i>  By no mean cross her; she</p>

<p>is then distempered far worse than now she</p>

<p>shows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span> <i>[to Daughter]</i>  Yes, he’s a fine man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  O , is he so? You have a sister.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  But she shall never have him–tell her so–</p>

<p>for a trick that I know; you’d best look to her, for</p>

<p>if she see him once, she’s gone, she’s done and</p>

<p>undone in an hour. All the young maids of our</p>

<p>town are in love with him, but I laugh at ’em and</p>

<p>let ’em all alone. Is ’t not a wise course?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  There is at least two hundred now with</p>

<p>child by him–there must be four; yet I keep close</p>

<p>for all this, close as a cockle; and all these must be</p>

<p>boys–he has the trick on ’t–and at ten years old</p>

<p>they must be all gelt for musicians and sing the</p>

<p>wars of Theseus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  This is strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  As ever you heard, but say nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  They come from all parts of the dukedom</p>

<p>to him; I’ll warrant you, he had not so few last</p>

<p>night as twenty to dispatch. He’ll tickle ’t up in two</p>

<p>hours, if his hand be in.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span> <i>[aside]</i>  She’s lost past all cure.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  You are master of a ship?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  Where’s your compass?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  Here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  Set it to th’ north. And now direct your</p>

<p>course to th’ wood, where Palamon lies longing for</p>

<p>me. For the tackling, let me alone.–Come, weigh,</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brother</span>  Let’s get her in!</p>
