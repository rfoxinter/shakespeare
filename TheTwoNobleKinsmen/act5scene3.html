<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta,</p>

<p>Emilia, Pirithous, and some Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>I’ll no step further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc>  Will you lose this sight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>I had rather see a wren hawk at a fly</p>

<p>Than this decision; ev’ry blow that falls</p>

<p>Threats a brave life; each stroke laments</p>

<p>The place whereon it falls, and sounds more like</p>

<p>A bell than blade. I will stay here.</p>

<p>It is enough my hearing shall be punished</p>

<p>With what shall happen, ’gainst the which there is</p>

<p>No deafing but to hear; not taint mine eye</p>

<p>With dread sights it may shun.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc> <i>[to Theseus]</i>  Sir, my good lord,</p>

<p>Your sister will no further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  O, she must.</p>

<p>She shall see deeds of honor in their kind,</p>

<p>Which sometime show well, penciled. Nature now</p>

<p>Shall make and act the story, the belief</p>

<p>Both sealed with eye and ear.–You must be present;</p>

<p>You are the victor’s meed, the price and garland</p>

<p>To crown the question’s title.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Pardon me.</p>

<p>If I were there, I’d wink.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  You must be there;</p>

<p>This trial is as ’twere i’ th’ night, and you</p>

<p>The only star to shine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  I am extinct;</p>

<p>There is but envy in that light which shows</p>

<p>The one the other. Darkness, which ever was</p>

<p>The dam of horror, who does stand accursed</p>

<p>Of many mortal millions, may even now,</p>

<p>By casting her black mantle over both,</p>

<p>That neither could find other, get herself</p>

<p>Some part of a good name, and many a murder</p>

<p>Set off whereto she’s guilty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc>  You must go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>In faith, I will not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  Why, the knights must kindle</p>

<p>Their valor at your eye. Know, of this war</p>

<p>You are the treasure, and must needs be by</p>

<p>To give the service pay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Sir, pardon me.</p>

<p>The title of a kingdom may be tried</p>

<p>Out of itself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  Well, well, then; at your pleasure.</p>

<p>Those that remain with you could wish their office</p>

<p>To any of their enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc>  Farewell, sister.</p>

<p>I am like to know your husband ’fore yourself</p>

<p>By some small start of time. He whom the gods</p>

<p>Do of the two know best, I pray them he</p>

<p>Be made your lot.</p>

<p><center><i>[Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, and others,</p>

<p>exit. Emilia remains, comparing again</p>

<p>the pictures of Arcite and Palamon.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Arcite is gently visaged, yet his eye</p>

<p>Is like an engine bent, or a sharp weapon</p>

<p>In a soft sheath; mercy and manly courage</p>

<p>Are bedfellows in his visage. Palamon</p>

<p>Has a most menacing aspect; his brow</p>

<p>Is graved, and seems to bury what it frowns on;</p>

<p>Yet sometimes ’tis not so, but alters to</p>

<p>The quality of his thoughts. Long time his eye</p>

<p>Will dwell upon his object. Melancholy</p>

<p>Becomes him nobly; so does Arcite’s mirth;</p>

<p>But Palamon’s sadness is a kind of mirth,</p>

<p>So mingled, as if mirth did make him sad</p>

<p>And sadness merry. Those darker humors that</p>

<p>Stick misbecomingly on others, on them</p>

<p>Live in fair dwelling.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cornets. Trumpets sound as to a charge.]</i></center></p>

<p>Hark how yon spurs to spirit do incite</p>

<p>The princes to their proof! Arcite may win me,</p>

<p>And yet may Palamon wound Arcite to</p>

<p>The spoiling of his figure. O, what pity</p>

<p>Enough for such a chance? If I were by,</p>

<p>I might do hurt, for they would glance their eyes</p>

<p>Towards my seat, and in that motion might</p>

<p>Omit a ward or forfeit an offense</p>

<p>Which craved that very time.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cornets. A great cry and noise</p>

<p>within crying “A Palamon!”]</i></center></p>

<p>It is much better</p>

<p>I am not there. O, better never born</p>

<p>Than minister to such harm!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What is the chance?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  The cry’s “A Palamon.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Then he has won. ’Twas ever likely.</p>

<p>He looked all grace and success, and he is</p>

<p>Doubtless the prim’st of men. I prithee run</p>

<p>And tell me how it goes.</p>

<p><center><i>[Shout and cornets, crying “A Palamon!”]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  Still “Palamon.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Run and inquire.     <i><i>[Servant exits.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[Addressing Arcite’s picture.]</i> Poor servant, thou hast</p>

<p>lost.</p>

<p>Upon my right side still I wore thy picture,</p>

<p>Palamon’s on the left–why so, I know not.</p>

<p>I had no end in ’t else; chance would have it so.</p>

<p>On the sinister side the heart lies; Palamon</p>

<p>Had the best-boding chance.</p>

<p><center><i>[Another cry, and shout within, and cornets.]</i></center></p>

<p>This burst of clamor</p>

<p>Is sure th’ end o’ th’ combat.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>They said that Palamon had Arcite’s body</p>

<p>Within an inch o’ th’ pyramid, that the cry</p>

<p>Was general “A Palamon.” But anon,</p>

<p>Th’ assistants made a brave redemption, and</p>

<p>The two bold titlers at this instant are</p>

<p>Hand to hand at it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Were they metamorphosed</p>

<p>Both into one–O, why, there were no woman</p>

<p>Worth so composed a man! Their single share,</p>

<p>Their nobleness peculiar to them, gives</p>

<p>The prejudice of disparity, value’s shortness,</p>

<p>To any lady breathing.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cornets. Cry within, “Arcite, Arcite.”]</i></center></p>

<p>More exulting?</p>

<p>“Palamon” still?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  Nay, now the sound is “Arcite.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>I prithee lay attention to the cry;</p>

<p>Set both thine ears to th’ business.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cornets. A great shout, and cry “Arcite, victory!”]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  The cry is “Arcite”</p>

<p>And “Victory! Hark, Arcite, victory!”</p>

<p>The combat’s consummation is proclaimed</p>

<p>By the wind instruments.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Half-sights saw</p>

<p>That Arcite was no babe. God’s lid, his richness</p>

<p>And costliness of spirit looked through him; it could</p>

<p>No more be hid in him than fire in flax,</p>

<p>Than humble banks can go to law with waters</p>

<p>That drift-winds force to raging. I did think</p>

<p>Good Palamon would miscarry, yet I knew not</p>

<p>Why I did think so. Our reasons are not prophets</p>

<p>When oft our fancies are. They are coming off.</p>

<p>Alas, poor Palamon!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Cornets. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous,</p>

<p>Arcite as victor, and Attendants and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Lo, where our sister is in expectation,</p>

<p>Yet quaking and unsettled.–Fairest Emily,</p>

<p>The gods by their divine arbitrament</p>

<p>Have given you this knight; he is a good one</p>

<p>As ever struck at head.–Give me your hands.</p>

<p>Receive you her, you him. Be plighted with</p>

<p>A love that grows as you decay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Emily,</p>

<p>To buy you I have lost what’s dearest to me</p>

<p>Save what is bought, and yet I purchase cheaply,</p>

<p>As I do rate your value.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  O loved sister,</p>

<p>He speaks now of as brave a knight as e’er</p>

<p>Did spur a noble steed. Surely the gods</p>

<p>Would have him die a bachelor, lest his race</p>

<p>Should show i’ th’ world too godlike. His behavior</p>

<p>So charmed me that methought Alcides was</p>

<p>To him a sow of lead. If I could praise</p>

<p>Each part of him to th’ all I have spoke, your Arcite</p>

<p>Did not lose by ’t, for he that was thus good</p>

<p>Encountered yet his better. I have heard</p>

<p>Two emulous Philomels beat the ear o’ th’ night</p>

<p>With their contentious throats, now one the higher,</p>

<p>Anon the other, then again the first,</p>

<p>And by-and-by out-breasted, that the sense</p>

<p>Could not be judge between ’em. So it fared</p>

<p>Good space between these kinsmen, till heavens did</p>

<p>Make hardly one the winner.–Wear the garland</p>

<p>With joy that you have won.–For the subdued,</p>

<p>Give them our present justice, since I know</p>

<p>Their lives but pinch ’em. Let it here be done.</p>

<p>The scene’s not for our seeing. Go we hence</p>

<p>Right joyful, with some sorrow.–Arm your prize;</p>

<p>I know you will not lose her.–Hippolyta,</p>

<p>I see one eye of yours conceives a tear,</p>

<p>The which it will deliver.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Is this winning?</p>

<p>O all you heavenly powers, where is your mercy?</p>

<p>But that your wills have said it must be so,</p>

<p>And charge me live to comfort this unfriended,</p>

<p>This miserable prince, that cuts away</p>

<p>A life more worthy from him than all women,</p>

<p>I should and would die too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc>  Infinite pity</p>

<p>That four such eyes should be so fixed on one</p>

<p>That two must needs be blind for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  So it is.</p>
