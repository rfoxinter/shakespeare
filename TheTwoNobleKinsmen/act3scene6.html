<p><center><i>[Enter Palamon from the bush.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>About this hour my cousin gave his faith</p>

<p>To visit me again, and with him bring</p>

<p>Two swords and two good armors. If he fail,</p>

<p>He’s neither man nor soldier. When he left me,</p>

<p>I did not think a week could have restored</p>

<p>My lost strength to me, I was grown so low</p>

<p>And crestfall’n with my wants. I thank thee, Arcite,</p>

<p>Thou art yet a fair foe, and I feel myself,</p>

<p>With this refreshing, able once again</p>

<p>To outdure danger. To delay it longer</p>

<p>Would make the world think, when it comes to</p>

<p>hearing,</p>

<p>That I lay fatting like a swine to fight</p>

<p>And not a soldier. Therefore, this blest morning</p>

<p>Shall be the last; and that sword he refuses,</p>

<p>If it but hold, I kill him with. ’Tis justice.</p>

<p>So, love and fortune for me!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Arcite with armors and swords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O, good morrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, noble kinsman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  I have put you</p>

<p>To too much pains, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  That too much, fair cousin,</p>

<p>Is but a debt to honor and my duty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>Would you were so in all, sir; I could wish you</p>

<p>As kind a kinsman as you force me find</p>

<p>A beneficial foe, that my embraces</p>

<p>Might thank you, not my blows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  I shall think either,</p>

<p>Well done, a noble recompense.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Then I shall quit you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>Defy me in these fair terms, and you show</p>

<p>More than a mistress to me. No more anger,</p>

<p>As you love anything that’s honorable!</p>

<p>We were not bred to talk, man; when we are armed</p>

<p>And both upon our guards, then let our fury,</p>

<p>Like meeting of two tides, fly strongly from us,</p>

<p>And then to whom the birthright of this beauty</p>

<p>Truly pertains–without upbraidings, scorns,</p>

<p>Despisings of our persons, and such poutings,</p>

<p>Fitter for girls and schoolboys–will be seen,</p>

<p>And quickly, yours or mine. Will ’t please you arm,</p>

<p>sir?</p>

<p>Or if you feel yourself not fitting yet</p>

<p>And furnished with your old strength, I’ll stay,</p>

<p>cousin,</p>

<p>And ev’ry day discourse you into health,</p>

<p>As I am spared. Your person I am friends with,</p>

<p>And I could wish I had not said I loved her,</p>

<p>Though I had died. But loving such a lady,</p>

<p>And justifying my love, I must not fly from ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>Arcite, thou art so brave an enemy</p>

<p>That no man but thy cousin’s fit to kill thee.</p>

<p>I am well and lusty. Choose your arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Choose you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>Wilt thou exceed in all, or dost thou do it</p>

<p>To make me spare thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  If you think so, cousin,</p>

<p>You are deceived, for as I am a soldier,</p>

<p>I will not spare you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  That’s well said.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  You’ll find it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>Then, as I am an honest man and love</p>

<p>With all the justice of affection,</p>

<p>I’ll pay thee soundly.     <i><i>[He chooses armor.]</i></i></p>

<p>This I’ll take.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span> <i>[taking the other]</i>  That’s mine, then.</p>

<p>I’ll arm you first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Do.     <i><i>[Arcite begins arming him.]</i></i></p>

<p>Pray thee tell me, cousin,</p>

<p>Where got’st thou this good armor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  ’Tis the Duke’s,</p>

<p>And to say true, I stole it. Do I pinch you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>Is ’t not too heavy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  I have worn a lighter,</p>

<p>But I shall make it serve.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  I’ll buckle ’t close.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>By any means.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  You care not for a grand guard?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>No, no, we’ll use no horses. I perceive</p>

<p>You would fain be at that fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  I am indifferent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>Faith, so am I. Good cousin, thrust the buckle</p>

<p>Through far enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  I warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  My casque now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>Will you fight bare-armed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  We shall be the nimbler.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>But use your gauntlets though. Those are o’ th’ least.</p>

<p>Prithee take mine, good cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Thank you, Arcite.</p>

<p>How do I look? Am I fall’n much away?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>Faith, very little; love has used you kindly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>I’ll warrant thee, I’ll strike home.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Do, and spare not.</p>

<p>I’ll give you cause, sweet cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Now to you, sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[He begins to arm Arcite.]</i></center></p>

<p>Methinks this armor’s very like that, Arcite,</p>

<p>Thou wor’st that day the three kings fell, but lighter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>That was a very good one, and that day,</p>

<p>I well remember, you outdid me, cousin.</p>

<p>I never saw such valor. When you charged</p>

<p>Upon the left wing of the enemy,</p>

<p>I spurred hard to come up, and under me</p>

<p>I had a right good horse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  You had, indeed;</p>

<p>A bright bay, I remember.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Yes, but all</p>

<p>Was vainly labored in me; you outwent me,</p>

<p>Nor could my wishes reach you; yet a little</p>

<p>I did by imitation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  More by virtue;</p>

<p>You are modest, cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  When I saw you charge first,</p>

<p>Methought I heard a dreadful clap of thunder</p>

<p>Break from the troop.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  But still before that flew</p>

<p>The lightning of your valor. Stay a little;</p>

<p>Is not this piece too strait?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  No, no, ’tis well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>I would have nothing hurt thee but my sword.</p>

<p>A bruise would be dishonor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Now I am perfect.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>Stand off, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Take my sword; I hold it better.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>I thank you, no; keep it; your life lies on it.</p>

<p>Here’s one; if it but hold, I ask no more</p>

<p>For all my hopes. My cause and honor guard me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>And me my love!</p>

<p><center><i>[They bow several ways, then advance and stand.]</i></center></p>

<p>Is there aught else to say?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>This only, and no more: thou art mine aunt’s son.</p>

<p>And that blood we desire to shed is mutual–</p>

<p>In me thine, and in thee mine. My sword</p>

<p>Is in my hand, and if thou kill’st me,</p>

<p>The gods and I forgive thee. If there be</p>

<p>A place prepared for those that sleep in honor,</p>

<p>I wish his weary soul that falls may win it.</p>

<p>Fight bravely, cousin. Give me thy noble hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span> <i>[as they shake hands]</i></p>

<p>Here, Palamon. This hand shall never more</p>

<p>Come near thee with such friendship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  I commend thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>If I fall, curse me, and say I was a coward,</p>

<p>For none but such dare die in these just trials.</p>

<p>Once more farewell, my cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Farewell, Arcite.</p>

<p><center><i>[Fight.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Horns within. They stand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>Lo, cousin, lo, our folly has undone us!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Why?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>This is the Duke, a-hunting, as I told you.</p>

<p>If we be found, we are wretched. O, retire,</p>

<p>For honor’s sake, and safely, presently</p>

<p>Into your bush again. Sir, we shall find</p>

<p>Too many hours to die in. Gentle cousin,</p>

<p>If you be seen, you perish instantly</p>

<p>For breaking prison, and I, if you reveal me,</p>

<p>For my contempt. Then all the world will scorn us,</p>

<p>And say we had a noble difference,</p>

<p>But base disposers of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  No, no, cousin,</p>

<p>I will no more be hidden, nor put off</p>

<p>This great adventure to a second trial.</p>

<p>I know your cunning, and I know your cause.</p>

<p>He that faints now, shame take him! Put thyself</p>

<p>Upon thy present guard–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  You are not mad?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>Or I will make th’ advantage of this hour</p>

<p>Mine own, and what to come shall threaten me</p>

<p>I fear less than my fortune. Know, weak cousin,</p>

<p>I love Emilia, and in that I’ll bury</p>

<p>Thee and all crosses else.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Then come what can come,</p>

<p>Thou shalt know, Palamon, I dare as well</p>

<p>Die as discourse or sleep. Only this fears me:</p>

<p>The law will have the honor of our ends.</p>

<p>Have at thy life!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Look to thine own well, Arcite.</p>

<p><center><i>[Fight again.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Horns. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia,</p>

<p>Pirithous and train.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>What ignorant and mad malicious traitors</p>

<p>Are you, that ’gainst the tenor of my laws</p>

<p>Are making battle, thus like knights appointed,</p>

<p>Without my leave and officers of arms?</p>

<p>By Castor, both shall die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Hold thy word, Theseus.</p>

<p>We are certainly both traitors, both despisers</p>

<p>Of thee and of thy goodness. I am Palamon,</p>

<p>That cannot love thee, he that broke thy prison.</p>

<p>Think well what that deserves. And this is Arcite.</p>

<p>A bolder traitor never trod thy ground,</p>

<p>A falser ne’er seemed friend. This is the man</p>

<p>Was begged and banished; this is he contemns thee</p>

<p>And what thou dar’st do; and in this disguise,</p>

<p>Against thine own edict, follows thy sister,</p>

<p>That fortunate bright star, the fair Emilia,</p>

<p>Whose servant–if there be a right in seeing</p>

<p>And first bequeathing of the soul to–justly</p>

<p>I am; and, which is more, dares think her his.</p>

<p>This treachery, like a most trusty lover,</p>

<p>I called him now to answer. If thou be’st</p>

<p>As thou art spoken, great and virtuous,</p>

<p>The true decider of all injuries,</p>

<p>Say “Fight again,” and thou shalt see me, Theseus,</p>

<p>Do such a justice thou thyself wilt envy.</p>

<p>Then take my life; I’ll woo thee to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span>  O heaven,</p>

<p>What more than man is this!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  I have sworn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  We seek not</p>

<p>Thy breath of mercy, Theseus. ’Tis to me</p>

<p>A thing as soon to die as thee to say it,</p>

<p>And no more moved. Where this man calls me</p>

<p>traitor,</p>

<p>Let me say thus much: if in love be treason,</p>

<p>In service of so excellent a beauty,</p>

<p>As I love most, and in that faith will perish,</p>

<p>As I have brought my life here to confirm it,</p>

<p>As I have served her truest, worthiest,</p>

<p>As I dare kill this cousin that denies it,</p>

<p>So let me be most traitor, and you please me.</p>

<p>For scorning thy edict, duke, ask that lady</p>

<p>Why she is fair, and why her eyes command me</p>

<p>Stay here to love her; and if she say “traitor,”</p>

<p>I am a villain fit to lie unburied.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>Thou shalt have pity of us both, O Theseus,</p>

<p>If unto neither thou show mercy. Stop,</p>

<p>As thou art just, thy noble ear against us;</p>

<p>As thou art valiant, for thy cousin’s soul,</p>

<p>Whose twelve strong labors crown his memory,</p>

<p>Let’s die together at one instant, duke;</p>

<p>Only a little let him fall before me,</p>

<p>That I may tell my soul he shall not have her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>I grant your wish, for to say true, your cousin</p>

<p>Has ten times more offended, for I gave him</p>

<p>More mercy than you found, sir, your offenses</p>

<p>Being no more than his.–None here speak for ’em,</p>

<p>For ere the sun set both shall sleep forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span></p>

<p>Alas, the pity! Now or never, sister,</p>

<p>Speak not to be denied. That face of yours</p>

<p>Will bear the curses else of after ages</p>

<p>For these lost cousins.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  In my face, dear sister,</p>

<p>I find no anger to ’em, nor no ruin.</p>

<p>The misadventure of their own eyes kill ’em.</p>

<p>Yet that I will be woman and have pity,</p>

<p>My knees shall grow to th’ ground but I’ll get mercy.</p>

<p><center><i>[She kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>Help me, dear sister; in a deed so virtuous,</p>

<p>The powers of all women will be with us.</p>

<p><center><i>[Hippolyta kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>Most royal brother–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  Sir, by our tie of marriage–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span></p>

<p>By your own spotless honor–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  By that faith,</p>

<p>That fair hand, and that honest heart you gave me–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span></p>

<p>By that you would have pity in another;</p>

<p>By your own virtues infinite–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  By valor;</p>

<p>By all the chaste nights I have ever pleased you–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>These are strange conjurings.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span>  Nay, then, I’ll in too.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>By all our friendship, sir, by all our dangers;</p>

<p>By all you love most, wars and this sweet lady–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span></p>

<p>By that you would have trembled to deny</p>

<p>A blushing maid–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  By your own eyes; by strength,</p>

<p>In which you swore I went beyond all women,</p>

<p>Almost all men, and yet I yielded, Theseus–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span></p>

<p>To crown all this: by your most noble soul,</p>

<p>Which cannot want due mercy, I beg first–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span></p>

<p>Next hear my prayers–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Last let me entreat, sir–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span></p>

<p>For mercy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  Mercy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Mercy on these princes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>You make my faith reel. <i>[(To Emilia.)]</i> Say I felt</p>

<p>Compassion to ’em both, how would you place it?</p>

<p><center><i>[They rise from their knees.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span></p>

<p>Upon their lives, but with their banishments.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>You are a right woman, sister: you have pity,</p>

<p>But want the understanding where to use it.</p>

<p>If you desire their lives, invent a way</p>

<p>Safer than banishment. Can these two live,</p>

<p>And have the agony of love about ’em,</p>

<p>And not kill one another? Every day</p>

<p>They’d fight about you, hourly bring your honor</p>

<p>In public question with their swords. Be wise, then,</p>

<p>And here forget ’em; it concerns your credit</p>

<p>And my oath equally. I have said they die.</p>

<p>Better they fall by th’ law than one another.</p>

<p>Bow not my honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  O, my noble brother,</p>

<p>That oath was rashly made, and in your anger;</p>

<p>Your reason will not hold it. If such vows</p>

<p>Stand for express will, all the world must perish.</p>

<p>Besides, I have another oath ’gainst yours,</p>

<p>Of more authority, I am sure more love,</p>

<p>Not made in passion neither, but good heed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>What is it, sister?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span>  Urge it home, brave lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span></p>

<p>That you would ne’er deny me anything</p>

<p>Fit for my modest suit and your free granting.</p>

<p>I tie you to your word now; if you fail in ’t,</p>

<p>Think how you maim your honor–</p>

<p>For now I am set a-begging, sir, I am deaf</p>

<p>To all but your compassion–how their lives</p>

<p>Might breed the ruin of my name. Opinion!</p>

<p>Shall anything that loves me perish for me?</p>

<p>That were a cruel wisdom. Do men prune</p>

<p>The straight young boughs that blush with thousand</p>

<p>blossoms</p>

<p>Because they may be rotten? O, Duke Theseus,</p>

<p>The goodly mothers that have groaned for these,</p>

<p>And all the longing maids that ever loved,</p>

<p>If your vow stand, shall curse me and my beauty,</p>

<p>And in their funeral songs for these two cousins</p>

<p>Despise my cruelty, and cry woe worth me,</p>

<p>Till I am nothing but the scorn of women.</p>

<p>For heaven’s sake, save their lives, and banish ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>On what conditions?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Swear ’em never more</p>

<p>To make me their contention, or to know me,</p>

<p>To tread upon thy dukedom, and to be,</p>

<p>Wherever they shall travel, ever strangers</p>

<p>To one another.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  I’ll be cut a-pieces</p>

<p>Before I take this oath! Forget I love her?</p>

<p>O, all you gods, despise me then! Thy banishment</p>

<p>I not mislike, so we may fairly carry</p>

<p>Our swords and cause along; else never trifle,</p>

<p>But take our lives, duke. I must love, and will,</p>

<p>And for that love must and dare kill this cousin</p>

<p>On any piece the Earth has.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  Will you, Arcite,</p>

<p>Take these conditions?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  He’s a villain, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span>  These are men!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>No, never, duke. ’Tis worse to me than begging</p>

<p>To take my life so basely; though I think</p>

<p>I never shall enjoy her, yet I’ll preserve</p>

<p>The honor of affection, and die for her,</p>

<p>Make death a devil!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>What may be done? For now I feel compassion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span></p>

<p>Let it not fall again, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  Say, Emilia,</p>

<p>If one of them were dead, as one must, are you</p>

<p>Content to take th’ other to your husband?</p>

<p>They cannot both enjoy you. They are princes</p>

<p>As goodly as your own eyes, and as noble</p>

<p>As ever fame yet spoke of. Look upon ’em,</p>

<p>And, if you can love, end this difference.</p>

<p>I give consent.–Are you content too, princes?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span></p>

<p>With all our souls.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  He that she refuses</p>

<p>Must die then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span>  Any death thou canst invent, duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>If I fall from that mouth, I fall with favor,</p>

<p>And lovers yet unborn shall bless my ashes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>If she refuse me, yet my grave will wed me,</p>

<p>And soldiers sing my epitaph.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span> <i>[to Emilia]</i>  Make choice, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span></p>

<p>I cannot, sir; they are both too excellent.</p>

<p>For me, a hair shall never fall of these men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span></p>

<p>What will become of ’em?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  Thus I ordain it–</p>

<p>And, by mine honor, once again, it stands,</p>

<p>Or both shall die: you shall both to your country,</p>

<p>And each within this month, accompanied</p>

<p>With three fair knights, appear again in this place,</p>

<p>In which I’ll plant a pyramid; and whether,</p>

<p>Before us that are here, can force his cousin</p>

<p>By fair and knightly strength to touch the pillar,</p>

<p>He shall enjoy her; the other lose his head,</p>

<p>And all his friends; nor shall he grudge to fall,</p>

<p>Nor think he dies with interest in this lady.</p>

<p>Will this content you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Yes.–Here, Cousin Arcite,</p>

<p>I am friends again till that hour.     <i><i>[He offers his hand.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  I embrace you.</p>

<p><center><i>[They shake hands.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>Are you content, sister?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Yes, I must, sir,</p>

<p>Else both miscarry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span> <i>[to Palamon and Arcite]</i></p>

<p>Come, shake hands again, then,</p>

<p>And take heed, as you are gentlemen, this quarrel</p>

<p>Sleep till the hour prefixed, and hold your course.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>We dare not fail thee, Theseus.</p>

<p><center><i>[They shake hands again.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  Come, I’ll give you</p>

<p>Now usage like to princes and to friends.</p>

<p>When you return, who wins I’ll settle here;</p>

<p>Who loses, yet I’ll weep upon his bier.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
