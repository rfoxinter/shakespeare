<p><span class='sc'>Prologue</span></p>

<p>New plays and maidenheads are near akin:</p>

<p>Much followed both, for both much money giv’n,</p>

<p>If they stand sound and well. And a good play,</p>

<p>Whose modest scenes blush on his marriage day</p>

<p>And shake to lose his honor, is like her</p>

<p>That after holy tie and first night’s stir</p>

<p>Yet still is modesty, and still retains</p>

<p>More of the maid, to sight, than husband’s pains.</p>

<p>We pray our play may be so, for I am sure</p>

<p>It has a noble breeder and a pure,</p>

<p>A learned, and a poet never went</p>

<p>More famous yet ’twixt Po and silver Trent.</p>

<p>Chaucer, of all admired, the story gives;</p>

<p>There, constant to eternity, it lives.</p>

<p>If we let fall the nobleness of this,</p>

<p>And the first sound this child hear be a hiss,</p>

<p>How will it shake the bones of that good man</p>

<p>And make him cry from underground “O, fan</p>

<p>From me the witless chaff of such a writer</p>

<p>That blasts my bays and my famed works makes</p>

<p>lighter</p>

<p>Than Robin Hood!” This is the fear we bring;</p>

<p>For, to say truth, it were an endless thing</p>

<p>And too ambitious, to aspire to him,</p>

<p>Weak as we are, and, almost breathless, swim</p>

<p>In this deep water. Do but you hold out</p>

<p>Your helping hands, and we shall tack about</p>

<p>And something do to save us. You shall hear</p>

<p>Scenes, though below his art, may yet appear</p>

<p>Worth two hours’ travel. To his bones sweet sleep;</p>

<p>Content to you. If this play do not keep</p>

<p>A little dull time from us, we perceive</p>

<p>Our losses fall so thick we must needs leave.</p>
