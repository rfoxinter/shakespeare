<p><center><i>[Enter Doctor, Jailer, and Wooer in</p>

<p>the habit of Palamon.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>Has this advice I told you done any good upon her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc></p>

<p>O, very much. The maids that kept her company</p>

<p>Have half-persuaded her that I am Palamon;</p>

<p>Within this half-hour she came smiling to me,</p>

<p>And asked me what I would eat, and when I would</p>

<p>kiss her.</p>

<p>I told her “Presently,” and kissed her twice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>’Twas well done; twenty times had been far better,</p>

<p>For there the cure lies mainly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc>  Then she told me</p>

<p>She would watch with me tonight, for well she knew</p>

<p>What hour my fit would take me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Let her do so,</p>

<p>And when your fit comes, fit her home,</p>

<p>And presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc>  She would have me sing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>You did so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  ’Twas very ill done, then.</p>

<p>You should observe her ev’ry way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc>  Alas,</p>

<p>I have no voice, sir, to confirm her that way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>That’s all one, if you make a noise.</p>

<p>If she entreat again, do anything.</p>

<p>Lie with her, if she ask you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Ho there, doctor!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>Yes, in the way of cure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  But first, by your leave,</p>

<p>I’ th’ way of honesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  That’s but a niceness.</p>

<p>Ne’er cast your child away for honesty.</p>

<p>Cure her first this way; then if she will be honest,</p>

<p>She has the path before her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc></p>

<p>Thank you, doctor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Pray bring her in</p>

<p>And let’s see how she is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  I will, and tell her</p>

<p>Her Palamon stays for her. But, doctor,</p>

<p>Methinks you are i’ th’ wrong still.     <i><i>[Jailer exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Go, go.</p>

<p>You fathers are fine fools. Her honesty?</p>

<p>And we should give her physic till we find that!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc></p>

<p>Why, do you think she is not honest, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>How old is she?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc>  She’s eighteen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  She may be.</p>

<p>But that’s all one; ’tis nothing to our purpose.</p>

<p>Whate’er her father says, if you perceive</p>

<p>Her mood inclining that way that I spoke of,</p>

<p>Videlicet, the way of flesh–you have me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc></p>

<p>Yes, very well, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Please her appetite,</p>

<p>And do it home; it cures her, ipso facto,</p>

<p>The melancholy humor that infects her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc></p>

<p>I am of your mind, doctor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  You’ll find it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Jailer, Daughter, and Maid.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>She comes; pray humor her.</p>

<p><center><i>[Wooer and Doctor stand aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc> <i>[to Daughter]</i></p>

<p>Come, your love Palamon stays for you, child,</p>

<p>And has done this long hour, to visit you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>I thank him for his gentle patience.</p>

<p>He’s a kind gentleman, and I am much bound to</p>

<p>him.</p>

<p>Did you ne’er see the horse he gave me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>How do you like him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  He’s a very fair one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>You never saw him dance?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  I have, often.</p>

<p>He dances very finely, very comely,</p>

<p>And for a jig, come cut and long tail to him,</p>

<p>He turns you like a top.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  That’s fine indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>He’ll dance the morris twenty mile an hour,</p>

<p>And that will founder the best hobbyhorse,</p>

<p>If I have any skill, in all the parish,</p>

<p>And gallops to the tune of “Light o’ love.”</p>

<p>What think you of this horse?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Having these virtues,</p>

<p>I think he might be brought to play at tennis.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>Alas, that’s nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Can he write and read too?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>A very fair hand, and casts himself th’ accounts</p>

<p>Of all his hay and provender. That hostler</p>

<p>Must rise betime that cozens him. You know</p>

<p>The chestnut mare the Duke has?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Very well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>She is horribly in love with him, poor beast,</p>

<p>But he is like his master, coy and scornful.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc></p>

<p>What dowry has she?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  Some two hundred bottles,</p>

<p>And twenty strike of oats, but he’ll ne’er have her.</p>

<p>He lisps in ’s neighing able to entice</p>

<p>A miller’s mare. He’ll be the death of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  What stuff she utters!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Wooer and Doctor come forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc></p>

<p>Make curtsy; here your love comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc>  Pretty soul,</p>

<p>How do you?     <i><i>[Daughter curtsies.]</i></i></p>

<p>That’s a fine maid; there’s a curtsy!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>Yours to command i’ th’ way of honesty.–</p>

<p>How far is ’t now to th’ end o’ th’ world, my masters?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>Why, a day’s journey, wench.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc> <i>[to Wooer]</i>  Will you go with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc></p>

<p>What shall we do there, wench?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  Why, play at</p>

<p>stool-ball.</p>

<p>What is there else to do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc>  I am content,</p>

<p>If we shall keep our wedding there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  ’Tis true,</p>

<p>For there, I will assure you, we shall find</p>

<p>Some blind priest for the purpose, that will venture</p>

<p>To marry us; for here they are nice and foolish.</p>

<p>Besides, my father must be hanged tomorrow,</p>

<p>And that would be a blot i’ th’ business.</p>

<p>Are not you Palamon?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc>  Do not you know me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>Yes, but you care not for me; I have nothing</p>

<p>But this poor petticoat and two coarse smocks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc></p>

<p>That’s all one; I will have you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  Will you surely?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc> <i>[taking her hand]</i></p>

<p>Yes, by this fair hand, will I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  We’ll to bed then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc></p>

<p>E’en when you will.     <i><i>[He kisses her.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc> <i>[wiping her face]</i>  O , sir, you would fain</p>

<p>be nibbling.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc></p>

<p>Why do you rub my kiss off?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  ’Tis a sweet one,</p>

<p>And will perfume me finely against the wedding.</p>

<p>Is not this your cousin Arcite?     <i><i>[She indicates Doctor.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Yes, sweetheart,</p>

<p>And I am glad my cousin Palamon</p>

<p>Has made so fair a choice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  Do you think he’ll have me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>Yes, without doubt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc> <i>[to Jailer]</i>  Do you think so too?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>We shall have many children. <i>[(To Doctor.)]</i> Lord,</p>

<p>how you’re grown!</p>

<p>My Palamon, I hope, will grow too, finely,</p>

<p>Now he’s at liberty. Alas, poor chicken,</p>

<p>He was kept down with hard meat and ill lodging,</p>

<p>But I’ll kiss him up again.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>What do you here? You’ll lose the noblest sight</p>

<p>That e’er was seen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Are they i’ th’ field?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  They are.</p>

<p>You bear a charge there too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  I’ll away straight.–</p>

<p>I must e’en leave you here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Nay, we’ll go with you.</p>

<p>I will not lose the sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc> <i>[aside to Doctor]</i>  How did you like her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>I’ll warrant you, within these three or four days</p>

<p>I’ll make her right again.     <i><i>[Jailer and Messenger exit.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[(To Wooer.)]</i> You must not from her,</p>

<p>But still preserve her in this way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc>  I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>Let’s get her in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc>  Come, sweet, we’ll go to dinner</p>

<p>And then we’ll play at cards.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  And shall we kiss too?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc></p>

<p>A hundred times.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  And twenty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc>  Ay, and twenty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>And then we’ll sleep together.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc> <i>[to Wooer]</i>  Take her offer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc></p>

<p>Yes, marry, will we.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  But you shall not hurt me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc></p>

<p>I will not, sweet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  If you do, love, I’ll cry.</p>
