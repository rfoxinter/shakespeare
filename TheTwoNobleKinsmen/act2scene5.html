<p><center><i>[This short flourish of cornets and shouts within.</p>

<p>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, Emilia, Arcite</p>

<p>in disguise, with a garland, Attendants, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span> <i>[to Arcite]</i></p>

<p>You have done worthily. I have not seen,</p>

<p>Since Hercules, a man of tougher sinews.</p>

<p>Whate’er you are, you run the best and wrestle</p>

<p>That these times can allow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  I am proud to please you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>What country bred you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  This; but far off, prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>Are you a gentleman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  My father said so,</p>

<p>And to those gentle uses gave me life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>Are you his heir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  His youngest, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  Your father,</p>

<p>Sure, is a happy sire, then. What proves you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>A little of all noble qualities.</p>

<p>I could have kept a hawk and well have hallowed</p>

<p>To a deep cry of dogs. I dare not praise</p>

<p>My feat in horsemanship, yet they that knew me</p>

<p>Would say it was my best piece. Last, and greatest,</p>

<p>I would be thought a soldier.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  You are perfect.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span></p>

<p>Upon my soul, a proper man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  He is so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span> <i>[to Hippolyta]</i></p>

<p>How do you like him, lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  I admire him.</p>

<p>I have not seen so young a man so noble,</p>

<p>If he say true, of his sort.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Believe,</p>

<p>His mother was a wondrous handsome woman;</p>

<p>His face, methinks, goes that way.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  But his body</p>

<p>And fiery mind illustrate a brave father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span></p>

<p>Mark how his virtue, like a hidden sun,</p>

<p>Breaks through his baser garments.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  He’s well got, sure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span> <i>[to Arcite]</i></p>

<p>What made you seek this place, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Noble Theseus,</p>

<p>To purchase name and do my ablest service</p>

<p>To such a well-found wonder as thy worth;</p>

<p>For only in thy court, of all the world,</p>

<p>Dwells fair-eyed Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span>  All his words are worthy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>Sir, we are much indebted to your travel,</p>

<p>Nor shall you lose your wish.–Pirithous,</p>

<p>Dispose of this fair gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span>  Thanks, Theseus.–</p>

<p>Whate’er you are, you’re mine, and I shall give you</p>

<p>To a most noble service: to this lady,</p>

<p>This bright young virgin.</p>

<p><center><i>[He brings Arcite to Emilia.]</i></center></p>

<p>Pray observe her goodness;</p>

<p>You have honored her fair birthday with your</p>

<p>virtues,</p>

<p>And, as your due, you’re hers. Kiss her fair hand, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>Sir, you’re a noble giver.–Dearest beauty,</p>

<p>Thus let me seal my vowed faith.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kisses her hand.]</i></center></p>

<p>When your servant,</p>

<p>Your most unworthy creature, but offends you,</p>

<p>Command him die, he shall.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  That were too cruel.</p>

<p>If you deserve well, sir, I shall soon see ’t.</p>

<p>You’re mine, and somewhat better than your rank</p>

<p>I’ll use you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span> <i>[to Arcite]</i></p>

<p>I’ll see you furnished, and because you say</p>

<p>You are a horseman, I must needs entreat you</p>

<p>This afternoon to ride–but ’tis a rough one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>I like him better, prince; I shall not then</p>

<p>Freeze in my saddle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span> <i>[to Hippolyta]</i>  Sweet, you must be ready,–</p>

<p>And you, Emilia,–and you, friend,–and all,</p>

<p>Tomorrow by the sun, to do observance</p>

<p>To flowery May in Dian’s wood.–Wait well, sir,</p>

<p>Upon your mistress.–Emily, I hope</p>

<p>He shall not go afoot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  That were a shame, sir,</p>

<p>While I have horses.–Take your choice, and what</p>

<p>You want at any time, let me but know it.</p>

<p>If you serve faithfully, I dare assure you</p>

<p>You’ll find a loving mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  If I do not,</p>

<p>Let me find that my father ever hated,</p>

<p>Disgrace and blows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  Go lead the way; you have won it.</p>

<p>It shall be so; you shall receive all dues</p>

<p>Fit for the honor you have won. ’Twere wrong else.–</p>

<p>Sister, beshrew my heart, you have a servant</p>

<p>That, if I were a woman, would be master;</p>

<p>But you are wise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  I hope too wise for that, sir.</p>
