<p><center><i>[Enter Guard with Palamon and his Knights,</p>

<p>pinioned; Jailer, Executioner and Others,</p>

<p>carrying a block and an ax.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>There’s many a man alive that hath outlived</p>

<p>The love o’ th’ people; yea, i’ th’ selfsame state</p>

<p>Stands many a father with his child. Some comfort</p>

<p>We have by so considering. We expire,</p>

<p>And not without men’s pity. To live still,</p>

<p>Have their good wishes; we prevent</p>

<p>The loathsome misery of age, beguile</p>

<p>The gout and rheum that in lag hours attend</p>

<p>For gray approachers; we come towards the gods</p>

<p>Young and unwappered, not halting under crimes</p>

<p>Many and stale. That sure shall please the gods</p>

<p>Sooner than such, to give us nectar with ’em,</p>

<p>For we are more clear spirits. My dear kinsmen,</p>

<p>Whose lives for this poor comfort are laid down,</p>

<p>You have sold ’em too too cheap.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Knight</span>  What ending could be</p>

<p>Of more content? O’er us the victors have</p>

<p>Fortune, whose title is as momentary</p>

<p>As to us death is certain. A grain of honor</p>

<p>They not o’er-weigh us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Knight</span>  Let us bid farewell;</p>

<p>And with our patience anger tott’ring Fortune,</p>

<p>Who at her certain’st reels.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Knight</span>  Come, who begins?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>E’en he that led you to this banquet shall</p>

<p>Taste to you all. <i>[To Jailer.]</i> Ah ha, my friend, my</p>

<p>friend,</p>

<p>Your gentle daughter gave me freedom once;</p>

<p>You’ll see ’t done now forever. Pray, how does she?</p>

<p>I heard she was not well; her kind of ill</p>

<p>Gave me some sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  Sir, she’s well restored,</p>

<p>And to be married shortly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  By my short life,</p>

<p>I am most glad on ’t. ’Tis the latest thing</p>

<p>I shall be glad of; prithee, tell her so.</p>

<p>Commend me to her, and to piece her portion,</p>

<p>Tender her this.     <i><i>[He gives his purse to Jailer.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Knight</span>  Nay, let’s be offerers all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Knight</span></p>

<p>Is it a maid?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Verily, I think so.</p>

<p>A right good creature, more to me deserving</p>

<p>Than I can quit or speak of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>Knights</span>  Commend us to her.</p>

<p><center><i>[They give their purses.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span></p>

<p>The gods requite you all and make her thankful!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>Adieu, and let my life be now as short</p>

<p>As my leave-taking.     <i><i>[Lays his head on the block.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Knight</span>  Lead, courageous cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>And</span> <span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Knights</span>  We’ll follow cheerfully.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[A great noise within crying “Run!” “Save!” “Hold!”</p>

<p>Enter in haste a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Hold, hold! O, hold, hold, hold!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pirithous in haste.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span></p>

<p>Hold, ho! It is a cursed haste you made</p>

<p>If you have done so quickly!–Noble Palamon,</p>

<p>The gods will show their glory in a life</p>

<p>That thou art yet to lead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Can that be,</p>

<p>When Venus, I have said, is false? How do things</p>

<p>fare?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span></p>

<p>Arise, great sir, and give the tidings ear</p>

<p>That are most dearly sweet and bitter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span> <i>[rising]</i>  What</p>

<p>Hath waked us from our dream?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span>  List then: your</p>

<p>cousin,</p>

<p>Mounted upon a steed that Emily</p>

<p>Did first bestow on him–a black one, owing</p>

<p>Not a hair worth of white, which some will say</p>

<p>Weakens his price, and many will not buy</p>

<p>His goodness with this note, which superstition</p>

<p>Here finds allowance–on this horse is Arcite</p>

<p>Trotting the stones of Athens–which the calkins</p>

<p>Did rather tell than trample, for the horse</p>

<p>Would make his length a mile, if ’t pleased his rider</p>

<p>To put pride in him. As he thus went counting</p>

<p>The flinty pavement, dancing, as ’twere, to th’ music</p>

<p>His own hooves made–for, as they say, from iron</p>

<p>Came music’s origin–what envious flint,</p>

<p>Cold as old Saturn, and like him possessed</p>

<p>With fire malevolent, darted a spark,</p>

<p>Or what fierce sulphur else, to this end made,</p>

<p>I comment not; the hot horse, hot as fire,</p>

<p>Took toy at this and fell to what disorder</p>

<p>His power could give his will; bounds, comes on end,</p>

<p>Forgets school-doing, being therein trained</p>

<p>And of kind manage. Pig-like he whines</p>

<p>At the sharp rowel, which he frets at rather</p>

<p>Than any jot obeys; seeks all foul means</p>

<p>Of boist’rous and rough jadery to disseat</p>

<p>His lord that kept it bravely. When naught served,</p>

<p>When neither curb would crack, girth break, nor</p>

<p>diff’ring plunges</p>

<p>Disroot his rider whence he grew, but that</p>

<p>He kept him ’tween his legs, on his hind hoofs</p>

<p>On end he stands</p>

<p>That Arcite’s legs, being higher than his head,</p>

<p>Seemed with strange art to hang. His victor’s wreath</p>

<p>Even then fell off his head, and presently</p>

<p>Backward the jade comes o’er, and his full poise</p>

<p>Becomes the rider’s load. Yet is he living,</p>

<p>But such a vessel ’tis that floats but for</p>

<p>The surge that next approaches. He much desires</p>

<p>To have some speech with you. Lo, he appears.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia,</p>

<p>and Arcite carried in a chair.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span></p>

<p>O, miserable end of our alliance!</p>

<p>The gods are mighty, Arcite. If thy heart,</p>

<p>Thy worthy, manly heart, be yet unbroken,</p>

<p>Give me thy last words. I am Palamon,</p>

<p>One that yet loves thee dying.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Take Emilia</p>

<p>And with her all the world’s joy. Reach thy hand;</p>

<p>Farewell. I have told my last hour. I was false,</p>

<p>Yet never treacherous. Forgive me, cousin.</p>

<p>One kiss from fair Emilia.     <i><i>[She kisses him.]</i></i></p>

<p>’Tis done.</p>

<p>Take her. I die.     <i><i>[He dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Thy brave soul seek Elysium!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span></p>

<p>I’ll close thine eyes, prince. Blessed souls be with</p>

<p>thee!</p>

<p>Thou art a right good man, and while I live,</p>

<p>This day I give to tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  And I to honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>In this place first you fought; e’en very here</p>

<p>I sundered you. Acknowledge to the gods</p>

<p>Our thanks that you are living.</p>

<p>His part is played, and though it were too short,</p>

<p>He did it well. Your day is lengthened, and</p>

<p>The blissful dew of heaven does arrouse you.</p>

<p>The powerful Venus well hath graced her altar,</p>

<p>And given you your love. Our master, Mars,</p>

<p>Hath vouched his oracle, and to Arcite gave</p>

<p>The grace of the contention. So the deities</p>

<p>Have showed due justice.–Bear this hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  O cousin,</p>

<p>That we should things desire which do cost us</p>

<p>The loss of our desire, that naught could buy</p>

<p>Dear love but loss of dear love.</p>

<p><center><i>[Arcite’s body is carried out.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  Never Fortune</p>

<p>Did play a subtler game. The conquered triumphs;</p>

<p>The victor has the loss; yet in the passage</p>

<p>The gods have been most equal.–Palamon,</p>

<p>Your kinsman hath confessed the right o’ th’ lady</p>

<p>Did lie in you, for you first saw her and</p>

<p>Even then proclaimed your fancy. He restored her</p>

<p>As your stol’n jewel and desired your spirit</p>

<p>To send him hence forgiven. The gods my justice</p>

<p>Take from my hand and they themselves become</p>

<p>The executioners. Lead your lady off,</p>

<p>And call your lovers from the stage of death,</p>

<p>Whom I adopt my friends. A day or two</p>

<p>Let us look sadly, and give grace unto</p>

<p>The funeral of Arcite, in whose end</p>

<p>The visages of bridegrooms we’ll put on</p>

<p>And smile with Palamon–for whom an hour,</p>

<p>But one hour since, I was as dearly sorry</p>

<p>As glad of Arcite, and am now as glad</p>

<p>As for him sorry. O you heavenly charmers,</p>

<p>What things you make of us! For what we lack</p>

<p>We laugh, for what we have are sorry, still</p>

<p>Are children in some kind. Let us be thankful</p>

<p>For that which is, and with you leave dispute</p>

<p>That are above our question. Let’s go off</p>

<p>And bear us like the time.</p>
