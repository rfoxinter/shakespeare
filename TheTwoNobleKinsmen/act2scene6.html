<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>Let all the dukes and all the devils roar!</p>

<p>He is at liberty. I have ventured for him,</p>

<p>And out I have brought him; to a little wood</p>

<p>A mile hence I have sent him, where a cedar</p>

<p>Higher than all the rest spreads like a plane</p>

<p>Fast by a brook, and there he shall keep close</p>

<p>Till I provide him files and food, for yet</p>

<p>His iron bracelets are not off. O Love,</p>

<p>What a stout-hearted child thou art! My father</p>

<p>Durst better have endured cold iron than done it.</p>

<p>I love him beyond love and beyond reason</p>

<p>Or wit or safety. I have made him know it;</p>

<p>I care not, I am desperate. If the law</p>

<p>Find me and then condemn me for ’t, some wenches,</p>

<p>Some honest-hearted maids, will sing my dirge</p>

<p>And tell to memory my death was noble,</p>

<p>Dying almost a martyr. That way he takes</p>

<p>I purpose is my way too. Sure he cannot</p>

<p>Be so unmanly as to leave me here.</p>

<p>If he do, maids will not so easily</p>

<p>Trust men again. And yet he has not thanked me</p>

<p>For what I have done; no, not so much as kissed me,</p>

<p>And that, methinks, is not so well; nor scarcely</p>

<p>Could I persuade him to become a free man,</p>

<p>He made such scruples of the wrong he did</p>

<p>To me and to my father. Yet I hope,</p>

<p>When he considers more, this love of mine</p>

<p>Will take more root within him. Let him do</p>

<p>What he will with me, so he use me kindly;</p>

<p>For use me so he shall, or I’ll proclaim him,</p>

<p>And to his face, no man. I’ll presently</p>

<p>Provide him necessaries and pack my clothes up,</p>

<p>And where there is a path of ground I’ll venture,</p>

<p>So he be with me. By him like a shadow</p>

<p>I’ll ever dwell. Within this hour the hubbub</p>

<p>Will be all o’er the prison. I am then</p>

<p>Kissing the man they look for. Farewell, father!</p>

<p>Get many more such prisoners and such daughters,</p>

<p>And shortly you may keep yourself. Now to him.</p>
