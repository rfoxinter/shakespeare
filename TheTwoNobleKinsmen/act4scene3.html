<p><center><i>[Enter Jailer, Wooer, Doctor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Her distraction is more at some time of the</p>

<p>moon than at other some, is it not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  She is continually in a harmless distemper,</p>

<p>sleeps little, altogether without appetite, save often</p>

<p>drinking, dreaming of another world, and a better;</p>

<p>and what broken piece of matter soe’er she’s about,</p>

<p>the name Palamon lards it, that she farces ev’ry</p>

<p>business withal, fits it to every question.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Jailer’s Daughter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look where she comes; you shall perceive her</p>

<p>behavior.     <i><i>[They stand aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  I have forgot it quite. The burden on ’t was</p>

<p>“down-a down-a,” and penned by no worse man</p>

<p>than Geraldo, Emilia’s schoolmaster. He’s as fantastical,</p>

<p>too, as ever he may go upon ’s legs, for in</p>

<p>the next world will Dido see Palamon, and then</p>

<p>will she be out of love with Aeneas.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc> <i>[aside to Jailer and Wooer]</i>  What stuff’s here?</p>

<p>Poor soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  E’en thus all day long.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  Now for this charm that I told you of, you</p>

<p>must bring a piece of silver on the tip of your</p>

<p>tongue, or no ferry; then if it be your chance to</p>

<p>come where the blessed spirits are, there’s a</p>

<p>sight now! We maids that have our livers perished,</p>

<p>cracked to pieces with love, we shall come there,</p>

<p>and do nothing all day long but pick flowers with</p>

<p>Proserpine. Then will I make Palamon a nosegay;</p>

<p>then let him mark me then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  How prettily she’s amiss! Note her a little</p>

<p>further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  Faith, I’ll tell you, sometime we go to</p>

<p>barley-break, we of the blessed. Alas, ’tis a sore life</p>

<p>they have i’ th’ other place–such burning, frying,</p>

<p>boiling, hissing, howling, chatt’ring, cursing–O,</p>

<p>they have shrewd measure, take heed! If one be</p>

<p>mad, or hang or drown themselves, thither they</p>

<p>go, Jupiter bless us, and there shall we be put in</p>

<p>a cauldron of lead and usurers’ grease, amongst a</p>

<p>whole million of cutpurses, and there boil like a</p>

<p>gammon of bacon that will never be enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  How her brains coins!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  Lords and courtiers that have got maids</p>

<p>with child, they are in this place. They shall stand</p>

<p>in fire up to the navel and in ice up to th’ heart, and</p>

<p>there th’ offending part burns and the deceiving</p>

<p>part freezes: in troth, a very grievous punishment,</p>

<p>as one would think, for such a trifle. Believe me,</p>

<p>one would marry a leprous witch to be rid on ’t, I’ll</p>

<p>assure you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  How she continues this fancy! ’Tis not an engraffed</p>

<p>madness, but a most thick and profound</p>

<p>melancholy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  To hear there a proud lady and a proud city</p>

<p>wife howl together–I were a beast an I’d call it</p>

<p>good sport. One cries “O this smoke!” th’ other,</p>

<p>“This fire!”; one cries, “O, that ever I did it behind</p>

<p>the arras!” and then howls; th’ other curses a suing</p>

<p>fellow and her garden house.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sings.]</i></center></p>

<p>I will be true, my stars, my fate, etc.</p>

<p><center><i>[Daughter exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  What think you of her, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  I think she has a perturbed mind, which I</p>

<p>cannot minister to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Alas, what then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Understand you she ever affected any man</p>

<p>ere she beheld Palamon?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  I was once, sir, in great hope she had fixed her</p>

<p>liking on this gentleman, my friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wooer</sc>  I did think so, too, and would account I had a</p>

<p>great penn’orth on ’t to give half my state that both</p>

<p>she and I, at this present, stood unfeignedly on the</p>

<p>same terms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  That intemp’rate surfeit of her eye hath distempered</p>

<p>the other senses. They may return and</p>

<p>settle again to execute their preordained faculties,</p>

<p>but they are now in a most extravagant vagary.</p>

<p>This you must do: confine her to a place where</p>

<p>the light may rather seem to steal in than be</p>

<p>permitted.–Take upon you, young sir, her friend,</p>

<p>the name of Palamon; say you come to eat with</p>

<p>her, and to commune of love. This will catch her</p>

<p>attention, for this her mind beats upon; other</p>

<p>objects that are inserted ’tween her mind and eye</p>

<p>become the pranks and friskins of her madness.</p>

<p>Sing to her such green songs of love as she says</p>

<p>Palamon hath sung in prison. Come to her stuck</p>

<p>in as sweet flowers as the season is mistress of,</p>

<p>and thereto make an addition of some other compounded</p>

<p>odors which are grateful to the sense.</p>

<p>All this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can</p>

<p>sing, and Palamon is sweet and ev’ry good thing.</p>

<p>Desire to eat with her, carve her, drink to her, and</p>

<p>still among intermingle your petition of grace and</p>

<p>acceptance into her favor. Learn what maids have</p>

<p>been her companions and playferes, and let them</p>

<p>repair to her with Palamon in their mouths, and</p>

<p>appear with tokens, as if they suggested for him.–</p>

<p>It is a falsehood she is in, which is with falsehoods</p>

<p>to be combated. This may bring her to eat,</p>

<p>to sleep, and reduce what’s now out of square in</p>

<p>her into their former law and regiment. I have seen</p>

<p>it approved, how many times I know not, but to</p>

<p>make the number more, I have great hope in this.</p>

<p>I will between the passages of this project come</p>

<p>in with my appliance. Let us put it in execution</p>

<p>and hasten the success, which doubt not will bring</p>

<p>forth comfort.</p>
