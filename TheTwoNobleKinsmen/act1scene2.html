<p><center><i>[Enter Palamon and Arcite.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>Dear Palamon, dearer in love than blood</p>

<p>And our prime cousin, yet unhardened in</p>

<p>The crimes of nature, let us leave the city</p>

<p>Thebes, and the temptings in ’t, before we further</p>

<p>Sully our gloss of youth,</p>

<p>And here to keep in abstinence we shame</p>

<p>As in incontinence; for not to swim</p>

<p>I’ th’ aid o’ th’ current were almost to sink,</p>

<p>At least to frustrate striving; and to follow</p>

<p>The common stream, ’twould bring us to an eddy</p>

<p>Where we should turn or drown; if labor through,</p>

<p>Our gain but life and weakness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Your advice</p>

<p>Is cried up with example. What strange ruins,</p>

<p>Since first we went to school, may we perceive</p>

<p>Walking in Thebes! Scars and bare weeds</p>

<p>The gain o’ th’ martialist, who did propound</p>

<p>To his bold ends honor and golden ingots,</p>

<p>Which though he won, he had not, and now flirted</p>

<p>By peace for whom he fought. Who then shall offer</p>

<p>To Mars’s so-scorned altar? I do bleed</p>

<p>When such I meet, and wish great Juno would</p>

<p>Resume her ancient fit of jealousy</p>

<p>To get the soldier work, that peace might purge</p>

<p>For her repletion, and retain anew</p>

<p>Her charitable heart, now hard and harsher</p>

<p>Than strife or war could be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Are you not out?</p>

<p>Meet you no ruin but the soldier in</p>

<p>The cranks and turns of Thebes? You did begin</p>

<p>As if you met decays of many kinds.</p>

<p>Perceive you none that do arouse your pity</p>

<p>But th’ unconsidered soldier?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Yes, I pity</p>

<p>Decays where’er I find them, but such most</p>

<p>That, sweating in an honorable toil,</p>

<p>Are paid with ice to cool ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  ’Tis not this</p>

<p>I did begin to speak of. This is virtue</p>

<p>Of no respect in Thebes. I spake of Thebes–</p>

<p>How dangerous, if we will keep our honors,</p>

<p>It is for our residing, where every evil</p>

<p>Hath a good color; where every seeming good’s</p>

<p>A certain evil; where not to be e’en jump</p>

<p>As they are here were to be strangers, and,</p>

<p>Such things to be, mere monsters.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  ’Tis in our power–</p>

<p>Unless we fear that apes can tutor ’s–to</p>

<p>Be masters of our manners. What need I</p>

<p>Affect another’s gait, which is not catching</p>

<p>Where there is faith? Or to be fond upon</p>

<p>Another’s way of speech, when by mine own</p>

<p>I may be reasonably conceived–saved too,</p>

<p>Speaking it truly? Why am I bound</p>

<p>By any generous bond to follow him</p>

<p>Follows his tailor, haply so long until</p>

<p>The followed make pursuit? Or let me know</p>

<p>Why mine own barber is unblessed, with him</p>

<p>My poor chin too, for ’tis not scissored just</p>

<p>To such a favorite’s glass? What canon is there</p>

<p>That does command my rapier from my hip</p>

<p>To dangle ’t in my hand, or to go tiptoe</p>

<p>Before the street be foul? Either I am</p>

<p>The forehorse in the team, or I am none</p>

<p>That draw i’ th’ sequent trace. These poor slight</p>

<p>sores</p>

<p>Need not a plantain. That which rips my bosom</p>

<p>Almost to th’ heart’s–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Our Uncle Creon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  He.</p>

<p>A most unbounded tyrant, whose successes</p>

<p>Makes heaven unfeared and villainy assured</p>

<p>Beyond its power there’s nothing; almost puts</p>

<p>Faith in a fever, and deifies alone</p>

<p>Voluble chance; who only attributes</p>

<p>The faculties of other instruments</p>

<p>To his own nerves and act; commands men service,</p>

<p>And what they win in ’t, boot and glory; one</p>

<p>That fears not to do harm; good, dares not. Let</p>

<p>The blood of mine that’s sib to him be sucked</p>

<p>From me with leeches; let them break and fall</p>

<p>Off me with that corruption.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Clear-spirited cousin,</p>

<p>Let’s leave his court, that we may nothing share</p>

<p>Of his loud infamy; for our milk</p>

<p>Will relish of the pasture, and we must</p>

<p>Be vile or disobedient, not his kinsmen</p>

<p>In blood unless in quality.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Nothing truer.</p>

<p>I think the echoes of his shames have deafed</p>

<p>The ears of heav’nly justice. Widows’ cries</p>

<p>Descend again into their throats and have not</p>

<p>Due audience of the gods.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Valerius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Valerius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valerius</span></p>

<p>The King calls for you; yet be leaden-footed</p>

<p>Till his great rage be off him. Phoebus, when</p>

<p>He broke his whipstock and exclaimed against</p>

<p>The horses of the sun, but whispered to</p>

<p>The loudness of his fury.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Small winds shake him.</p>

<p>But what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valerius</span></p>

<p>Theseus, who where he threats appalls, hath sent</p>

<p>Deadly defiance to him and pronounces</p>

<p>Ruin to Thebes, who is at hand to seal</p>

<p>The promise of his wrath.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Let him approach.</p>

<p>But that we fear the gods in him, he brings not</p>

<p>A jot of terror to us. Yet what man</p>

<p>Thirds his own worth–the case is each of ours–</p>

<p>When that his action’s dregged with mind assured</p>

<p>’Tis bad he goes about?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Leave that unreasoned.</p>

<p>Our services stand now for Thebes, not Creon.</p>

<p>Yet to be neutral to him were dishonor,</p>

<p>Rebellious to oppose. Therefore we must</p>

<p>With him stand to the mercy of our fate,</p>

<p>Who hath bounded our last minute.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  So we must.</p>

<p><i>[To Valerius.]</i> Is ’t said this war’s afoot? Or, it shall</p>

<p>be,</p>

<p>On fail of some condition?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valerius</span>  ’Tis in motion;</p>

<p>The intelligence of state came in the instant</p>

<p>With the defier.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Palamon</span>  Let’s to the King, who, were he</p>

<p>A quarter carrier of that honor which</p>

<p>His enemy come in, the blood we venture</p>

<p>Should be as for our health, which were not spent,</p>

<p>Rather laid out for purchase. But alas,</p>

<p>Our hands advanced before our hearts, what will</p>

<p>The fall o’ th’ stroke do damage?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Let th’ event,</p>

<p>That never-erring arbitrator, tell us</p>

<p>When we know all ourselves, and let us follow</p>

<p>The becking of our chance.</p>
