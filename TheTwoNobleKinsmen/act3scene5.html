<p><center><i>[Enter a Schoolmaster and six Countrymen,</p>

<p>one dressed as a Bavian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  Fie, fie, what tediosity and disinsanity</p>

<p>is here among you! Have my rudiments been labored</p>

<p>so long with you, milked unto you, and, by a</p>

<p>figure, even the very plum broth and marrow of</p>

<p>my understanding laid upon you, and do you still</p>

<p>cry “Where?” and “How?” and “Wherefore?” You</p>

<p>most coarse-frieze capacities, you jean judgments,</p>

<p>have I said “Thus let be” and “There let be”</p>

<p>and “Then let be” and no man understand me? Proh</p>

<p>deum, medius fidius, you are all dunces! Forwhy,</p>

<p>here stand I; here the Duke comes; there are you,</p>

<p>close in the thicket; the Duke appears; I meet him</p>

<p>and unto him I utter learned things and many figures;</p>

<p>he hears, and nods, and hums, and then cries</p>

<p>“Rare!” and I go forward. At length I fling my cap</p>

<p>up–mark there! Then do you as once did Meleager</p>

<p>and the boar–break comely out before him;</p>

<p>like true lovers, cast yourselves in a body decently,</p>

<p>and sweetly, by a figure, trace and turn, boys.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  And sweetly we will do it, Master</p>

<p>Gerald.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  Draw up the company. Where’s</p>

<p>the taborer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  Why, Timothy!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Taborer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Taborer</sc>  Here, my mad boys. Have at you!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  But I say, where’s their women?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter five Wenches.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  Here’s Fritz and Maudlin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  And little Luce with the white</p>

<p>legs, and bouncing Barbary.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  And freckled Nell, that never failed</p>

<p>her master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  Where be your ribbons, maids? Swim</p>

<p>with your bodies, and carry it sweetly and deliverly,</p>

<p>and now and then a favor and a frisk.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nell</sc>  Let us alone, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  Where’s the rest o’ th’ music?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  Dispersed, as you commanded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  Couple, then, and see what’s wanting.</p>

<p>Where’s the Bavian?–My friend, carry your tail</p>

<p>without offense or scandal to the ladies; and be</p>

<p>sure you tumble with audacity and manhood, and</p>

<p>when you bark, do it with judgment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bavian</sc>  Yes, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  Quo usque tandem? Here is a woman</p>

<p>wanting.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  We may go whistle; all the fat’s i’</p>

<p>th’ fire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  We have, as learned authors utter,</p>

<p>washed a tile; we have been fatuus and labored</p>

<p>vainly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  This is that scornful piece, that</p>

<p>scurvy hilding that gave her promise faithfully she</p>

<p>would be here–Cicely, the sempster’s daughter.</p>

<p>The next gloves that I give her shall be dogskin;</p>

<p>nay, an she fail me once–you can tell, Arcas, she</p>

<p>swore by wine and bread she would not break.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  An eel and woman, a learned poet</p>

<p>says, unless by th’ tail and with thy teeth thou hold,</p>

<p>will either fail. In manners, this was false</p>

<p>position.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  A fire ill take her! Does she flinch</p>

<p>now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  What shall we determine, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  Nothing. Our business is become a</p>

<p>nullity, yea, and a woeful and a piteous nullity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  Now, when the credit of our town</p>

<p>lay on it, now to be frampold, now to piss o’ th’</p>

<p>nettle! Go thy ways; I’ll remember thee. I’ll fit</p>

<p>thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Jailer’s Daughter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>The George Alow came from the south,</i></p>

<p>     <i>From the coast of Barbary-a,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And there he met with brave gallants of war,</i></p>

<p>     <i>By one, by two, by three-a.</i></p>

<p>     <i>“Well hailed, well hailed, you jolly gallants,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And whither now are you bound-a?</i></p>

<p>     <i>O, let me have your company</i></p>

<p>     <i>Till I come to the sound-a.”</i></p>

<p>There was three fools, fell out about an owlet–</p>

<p><i>[Sings]</i>      <i>The one he said it was an owl,</i></p>

<p>        <i>The other he said nay,</i></p>

<p>     <i>The third he said it was a hawk,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And her bells were cut away.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  There’s a dainty madwoman, master,</p>

<p>comes i’ th’ nick, as mad as a March hare. If we</p>

<p>can get her dance, we are made again. I warrant</p>

<p>her, she’ll do the rarest gambols.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  A madwoman? We are made, boys.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc> <i>[to Jailer’s Daughter]</i>  And are you mad,</p>

<p>good woman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  I would be sorry else. Give me your hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  Why?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  I can tell your fortune. <i>[She looks at his</p>

<p>hand.]</i> You are a fool. Tell ten.–I have posed him.</p>

<p>Buzz!–Friend, you must eat no white bread; if</p>

<p>you do, your teeth will bleed extremely. Shall we</p>

<p>dance, ho? I know you, you’re a tinker. Sirrah tinker,</p>

<p>stop no more holes but what you should.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  Dii boni! A tinker, damsel?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  Or a conjurer. Raise me a devil now, and let</p>

<p>him play Chi passa o’ th’ bells and bones.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  Go, take her, and fluently persuade her</p>

<p>to a peace. Et opus exegi, quod nec Iovis ira, nec</p>

<p>ignis. Strike up, and lead her in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  Come, lass, let’s trip it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc>  I’ll lead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Countryman</sc>  Do, do!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  Persuasively, and cunningly.</p>

<p><center><i>[Wind horns.]</i></center></p>

<p>Away, boys! I hear the horns. Give me some</p>

<p>meditation, and mark your cue.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Schoolmaster exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Pallas, inspire me!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Theseus, Pirithous, Hippolyta, Emilia, and train.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  This way the stag took.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc>  Stay, and edify!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  What have we here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc>  Some country sport, upon my life, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc> <i>[to Schoolmaster]</i>  Well, sir, go forward. We</p>

<p>will “edify.”     <i><i>[Chairs and stools brought out.]</i></i></p>

<p>Ladies, sit down. We’ll stay it.</p>

<p><center><i>[Theseus, Hippolyta, and Emilia sit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc></p>

<p>Thou doughty duke, all hail!–All hail, sweet ladies!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  This is a cold beginning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc></p>

<p>If you but favor, our country pastime made is.</p>

<p>We are a few of those collected here</p>

<p>That ruder tongues distinguish “villager.”</p>

<p>And to say verity, and not to fable,</p>

<p>We are a merry rout, or else a rabble,</p>

<p>Or company, or by a figure, chorus,</p>

<p>That ’fore thy dignity will dance a morris.</p>

<p>And I that am the rectifier of all,</p>

<p>By title pedagogus, that let fall</p>

<p>The birch upon the breeches of the small ones,</p>

<p>And humble with a ferula the tall ones,</p>

<p>Do here present this machine, or this frame.</p>

<p>And, dainty duke, whose doughty dismal fame</p>

<p>From Dis to Daedalus, from post to pillar,</p>

<p>Is blown abroad, help me, thy poor well-willer,</p>

<p>And with thy twinkling eyes look right and straight</p>

<p>Upon this mighty “Morr,” of mickle weight–</p>

<p>“Is” now comes in, which being glued together</p>

<p>Makes “Morris,” and the cause that we came hither.</p>

<p>The body of our sport, of no small study,</p>

<p>I first appear, though rude, and raw, and muddy,</p>

<p>To speak before thy noble grace this tenner,</p>

<p>At whose great feet I offer up my penner.</p>

<p>The next, the Lord of May and Lady bright,</p>

<p>The Chambermaid and Servingman by night</p>

<p>That seek out silent hanging; then mine Host</p>

<p>And his fat Spouse, that welcomes to their cost</p>

<p>The galled traveler, and with a beck’ning</p>

<p>Informs the tapster to inflame the reck’ning;</p>

<p>Then the beest-eating Clown; and next the Fool,</p>

<p>The Bavian with long tail and eke long tool,</p>

<p>Cum multis aliis that make a dance;</p>

<p>Say “ay,” and all shall presently advance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Ay, ay, by any means, dear Domine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc>  Produce!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc></p>

<p>Intrate, filii. Come forth and foot it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Music. Enter the Countrymen, Countrywomen, and</p>

<p>Jailer’s Daughter; they perform a morris dance.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Ladies, if we have been merry</i></p>

<p>     <i>And have pleased ye with a derry,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And a derry and a down,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Say the Schoolmaster’s no clown.–</i></p>

<p>     <i>Duke, if we have pleased thee too</i></p>

<p>     <i>And have done as good boys should do,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Give us but a tree or twain</i></p>

<p>     <i>For a Maypole, and again,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Ere another year run out,</i></p>

<p>     <i>We’ll make thee laugh, and all this rout.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Take twenty, Domine.–How does my sweetheart?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc></p>

<p>Never so pleased, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  ’Twas an excellent dance,</p>

<p>And, for a preface, I never heard a better.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Schoolmaster, I thank you.–One see ’em all</p>

<p>rewarded.     <i><i>[An Attendant gives money.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc></p>

<p>And here’s something to paint your pole withal.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives money.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  Now to our sports again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Schoolmaster</sc></p>

<p>     <i>May the stag thou hunt’st stand long,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And thy dogs be swift and strong;</i></p>

<p>     <i>May they kill him without lets,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And the ladies eat his dowsets.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[Wind horns within. Theseus, Hippolyta,</p>
