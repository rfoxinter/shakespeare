<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>Why should I love this gentleman? ’Tis odds</p>

<p>He never will affect me. I am base,</p>

<p>My father the mean keeper of his prison,</p>

<p>And he a prince. To marry him is hopeless;</p>

<p>To be his whore is witless. Out upon ’t!</p>

<p>What pushes are we wenches driven to</p>

<p>When fifteen once has found us! First, I saw him;</p>

<p>I, seeing, thought he was a goodly man;</p>

<p>He has as much to please a woman in him,</p>

<p>If he please to bestow it so, as ever</p>

<p>These eyes yet looked on. Next, I pitied him,</p>

<p>And so would any young wench, o’ my conscience,</p>

<p>That ever dreamed, or vowed her maidenhead</p>

<p>To a young handsome man. Then I loved him,</p>

<p>Extremely loved him, infinitely loved him!</p>

<p>And yet he had a cousin, fair as he too.</p>

<p>But in my heart was Palamon, and there,</p>

<p>Lord, what a coil he keeps! To hear him</p>

<p>Sing in an evening, what a heaven it is!</p>

<p>And yet his songs are sad ones. Fairer spoken</p>

<p>Was never gentleman. When I come in</p>

<p>To bring him water in a morning, first</p>

<p>He bows his noble body, then salutes me thus:</p>

<p>“Fair, gentle maid, good morrow. May thy goodness</p>

<p>Get thee a happy husband.” Once he kissed me;</p>

<p>I loved my lips the better ten days after.</p>

<p>Would he would do so ev’ry day! He grieves much–</p>

<p>And me as much to see his misery.</p>

<p>What should I do to make him know I love him?</p>

<p>For I would fain enjoy him. Say I ventured</p>

<p>To set him free? What says the law then?</p>

<p>Thus much for law or kindred! I will do it,</p>

<p>And this night, or tomorrow, he shall love me.</p>
