<p><center><i>[Cornets in sundry places. Noise and hallowing</p>

<p>as people a-Maying. Enter Arcite alone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc></p>

<p>The Duke has lost Hippolyta; each took</p>

<p>A several laund. This is a solemn rite</p>

<p>They owe bloomed May, and the Athenians pay it</p>

<p>To th’ heart of ceremony. O Queen Emilia,</p>

<p>Fresher than May, sweeter</p>

<p>Than her gold buttons on the boughs, or all</p>

<p>Th’ enameled knacks o’ th’ mead or garden–yea,</p>

<p>We challenge too the bank of any nymph</p>

<p>That makes the stream seem flowers; thou, O jewel</p>

<p>O’ th’ wood, o’ th’ world, hast likewise blessed a pace</p>

<p>With thy sole presence. In thy rumination</p>

<p>That I, poor man, might eftsoons come between</p>

<p>And chop on some cold thought! Thrice blessed</p>

<p>chance</p>

<p>To drop on such a mistress, expectation</p>

<p>Most guiltless on ’t. Tell me, O Lady Fortune,</p>

<p>Next after Emily my sovereign, how far</p>

<p>I may be proud. She takes strong note of me,</p>

<p>Hath made me near her; and this beauteous morn,</p>

<p>The prim’st of all the year, presents me with</p>

<p>A brace of horses; two such steeds might well</p>

<p>Be by a pair of kings backed, in a field</p>

<p>That their crowns’ titles tried. Alas, alas,</p>

<p>Poor cousin Palamon, poor prisoner, thou</p>

<p>So little dream’st upon my fortune that</p>

<p>Thou think’st thyself the happier thing, to be</p>

<p>So near Emilia; me thou deem’st at Thebes,</p>

<p>And therein wretched, although free. But if</p>

<p>Thou knew’st my mistress breathed on me, and that</p>

<p>I eared her language, lived in her eye–O coz,</p>

<p>What passion would enclose thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Palamon as out of a bush, with his shackles;</p>

<p>he bends his fist at Arcite.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Traitor kinsman,</p>

<p>Thou shouldst perceive my passion if these signs</p>

<p>Of prisonment were off me, and this hand</p>

<p>But owner of a sword. By all oaths in one,</p>

<p>I and the justice of my love would make thee</p>

<p>A confessed traitor, O thou most perfidious</p>

<p>That ever gently looked, the void’st of honor</p>

<p>That e’er bore gentle token, falsest cousin</p>

<p>That ever blood made kin! Call’st thou her thine?</p>

<p>I’ll prove it in my shackles, with these hands,</p>

<p>Void of appointment, that thou liest, and art</p>

<p>A very thief in love, a chaffy lord,</p>

<p>Nor worth the name of villain. Had I a sword,</p>

<p>And these house clogs away–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Dear cousin Palamon–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>Cozener Arcite, give me language such</p>

<p>As thou hast showed me feat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Not finding in</p>

<p>The circuit of my breast any gross stuff</p>

<p>To form me like your blazon holds me to</p>

<p>This gentleness of answer: ’tis your passion</p>

<p>That thus mistakes, the which, to you being enemy,</p>

<p>Cannot to me be kind. Honor and honesty</p>

<p>I cherish and depend on, howsoe’er</p>

<p>You skip them in me, and with them, fair coz,</p>

<p>I’ll maintain my proceedings. Pray be pleased</p>

<p>To show in generous terms your griefs, since that</p>

<p>Your question’s with your equal, who professes</p>

<p>To clear his own way with the mind and sword</p>

<p>Of a true gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  That thou durst, Arcite!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc></p>

<p>My coz, my coz, you have been well advertised</p>

<p>How much I dare; you’ve seen me use my sword</p>

<p>Against th’ advice of fear. Sure, of another</p>

<p>You would not hear me doubted, but your silence</p>

<p>Should break out, though i’ th’ sanctuary.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Sir,</p>

<p>I have seen you move in such a place which well</p>

<p>Might justify your manhood; you were called</p>

<p>A good knight and a bold. But the whole week’s not</p>

<p>fair</p>

<p>If any day it rain; their valiant temper</p>

<p>Men lose when they incline to treachery,</p>

<p>And then they fight like compelled bears–would fly</p>

<p>Were they not tied.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Kinsman, you might as well</p>

<p>Speak this and act it in your glass as to</p>

<p>His ear which now disdains you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Come up to me;</p>

<p>Quit me of these cold gyves, give me a sword</p>

<p>Though it be rusty, and the charity</p>

<p>Of one meal lend me. Come before me then,</p>

<p>A good sword in thy hand, and do but say</p>

<p>That Emily is thine, I will forgive</p>

<p>The trespass thou hast done me–yea, my life,</p>

<p>If then thou carry ’t; and brave souls in shades</p>

<p>That have died manly, which will seek of me</p>

<p>Some news from Earth, they shall get none but this:</p>

<p>That thou art brave and noble.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Be content.</p>

<p>Again betake you to your hawthorn house.</p>

<p>With counsel of the night I will be here</p>

<p>With wholesome viands. These impediments</p>

<p>Will I file off. You shall have garments and</p>

<p>Perfumes to kill the smell o’ th’ prison. After,</p>

<p>When you shall stretch yourself and say but “Arcite,</p>

<p>I am in plight,” there shall be at your choice</p>

<p>Both sword and armor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  O you heavens, dares any</p>

<p>So noble bear a guilty business? None</p>

<p>But only Arcite. Therefore none but Arcite</p>

<p>In this kind is so bold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Sweet Palamon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>I do embrace you and your offer; for</p>

<p>Your offer do ’t I only. Sir, your person</p>

<p>Without hypocrisy I may not wish</p>

<p>More than my sword’s edge on ’t.</p>

<p><center><i>[Wind horns off; sound cornets.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  You hear the horns.</p>

<p>Enter your muset, lest this match between ’s</p>

<p>Be crossed ere met. Give me your hand; farewell.</p>

<p>I’ll bring you every needful thing. I pray you,</p>

<p>Take comfort and be strong.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Pray hold your promise,</p>

<p>And do the deed with a bent brow. Most certain</p>

<p>You love me not; be rough with me, and pour</p>

<p>This oil out of your language. By this air,</p>

<p>I could for each word give a cuff, my stomach</p>

<p>Not reconciled by reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Plainly spoken,</p>

<p>Yet pardon me hard language. When I spur</p>

<p>My horse, I chide him not; content and anger</p>

<p>In me have but one face.     <i><i>[Wind horns.]</i></i></p>

<p>Hark, sir, they call</p>

<p>The scattered to the banquet; you must guess</p>

<p>I have an office there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Sir, your attendance</p>

<p>Cannot please heaven, and I know your office</p>

<p>Unjustly is achieved.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  ’Tis a good title.</p>

<p>I am persuaded this question, sick between ’s,</p>

<p>By bleeding must be cured. I am a suitor</p>

<p>That to your sword you will bequeath this plea,</p>

<p>And talk of it no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  But this one word:</p>

<p>You are going now to gaze upon my mistress,</p>

<p>For note you, mine she is–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Nay then,–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Nay, pray you,</p>

<p>You talk of feeding me to breed me strength.</p>

<p>You are going now to look upon a sun</p>

<p>That strengthens what it looks on; there</p>

<p>You have a vantage o’er me, but enjoy ’t till</p>

<p>I may enforce my remedy. Farewell.</p>
