<p><center><i>[Palamon and Arcite remain, above.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>How do you, noble cousin?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  How do you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>Why, strong enough to laugh at misery</p>

<p>And bear the chance of war; yet we are prisoners</p>

<p>I fear forever, cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  I believe it,</p>

<p>And to that destiny have patiently</p>

<p>Laid up my hour to come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  O, cousin Arcite,</p>

<p>Where is Thebes now? Where is our noble country?</p>

<p>Where are our friends and kindreds? Never more</p>

<p>Must we behold those comforts, never see</p>

<p>The hardy youths strive for the games of honor,</p>

<p>Hung with the painted favors of their ladies,</p>

<p>Like tall ships under sail; then start amongst ’em</p>

<p>And as an east wind leave ’em all behind us,</p>

<p>Like lazy clouds, whilst Palamon and Arcite,</p>

<p>Even in the wagging of a wanton leg,</p>

<p>Outstripped the people’s praises, won the garlands</p>

<p>Ere they have time to wish ’em ours. O, never</p>

<p>Shall we two exercise, like twins of honor,</p>

<p>Our arms again, and feel our fiery horses</p>

<p>Like proud seas under us. Our good swords now–</p>

<p>Better the red-eyed god of war ne’er wore–</p>

<p>Ravished our sides, like age must run to rust</p>

<p>And deck the temples of those gods that hate us;</p>

<p>These hands shall never draw ’em out like lightning</p>

<p>To blast whole armies more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  No, Palamon,</p>

<p>Those hopes are prisoners with us. Here we are</p>

<p>And here the graces of our youths must wither</p>

<p>Like a too-timely spring. Here age must find us</p>

<p>And–which is heaviest, Palamon–unmarried.</p>

<p>The sweet embraces of a loving wife,</p>

<p>Loaden with kisses, armed with thousand Cupids,</p>

<p>Shall never clasp our necks; no issue know us–</p>

<p>No figures of ourselves shall we e’er see,</p>

<p>To glad our age, and like young eagles teach ’em</p>

<p>Boldly to gaze against bright arms and say</p>

<p>“Remember what your fathers were, and conquer!”</p>

<p>The fair-eyed maids shall weep our banishments</p>

<p>And in their songs curse ever-blinded Fortune</p>

<p>Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done</p>

<p>To youth and nature. This is all our world.</p>

<p>We shall know nothing here but one another,</p>

<p>Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes.</p>

<p>The vine shall grow, but we shall never see it;</p>

<p>Summer shall come, and with her all delights,</p>

<p>But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>’Tis too true, Arcite. To our Theban hounds</p>

<p>That shook the aged forest with their echoes</p>

<p>No more now must we halloo; no more shake</p>

<p>Our pointed javelins whilst the angry swine</p>

<p>Flies like a Parthian quiver from our rages,</p>

<p>Struck with our well-steeled darts. All valiant uses,</p>

<p>The food and nourishment of noble minds,</p>

<p>In us two here shall perish; we shall die,</p>

<p>Which is the curse of honor, lastly,</p>

<p>Children of grief and ignorance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Yet, cousin,</p>

<p>Even from the bottom of these miseries,</p>

<p>From all that fortune can inflict upon us,</p>

<p>I see two comforts rising, two mere blessings,</p>

<p>If the gods please: to hold here a brave patience,</p>

<p>And the enjoying of our griefs together.</p>

<p>Whilst Palamon is with me, let me perish</p>

<p>If I think this our prison!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Certainly</p>

<p>’Tis a main goodness, cousin, that our fortunes</p>

<p>Were twined together. ’Tis most true, two souls</p>

<p>Put in two noble bodies, let ’em suffer</p>

<p>The gall of hazard, so they grow together,</p>

<p>Will never sink; they must not, say they could.</p>

<p>A willing man dies sleeping and all’s done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc></p>

<p>Shall we make worthy uses of this place</p>

<p>That all men hate so much?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  How, gentle cousin?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc></p>

<p>Let’s think this prison holy sanctuary</p>

<p>To keep us from corruption of worse men.</p>

<p>We are young and yet desire the ways of honor</p>

<p>That liberty and common conversation,</p>

<p>The poison of pure spirits, might like women</p>

<p>Woo us to wander from. What worthy blessing</p>

<p>Can be but our imaginations</p>

<p>May make it ours? And here being thus together,</p>

<p>We are an endless mine to one another;</p>

<p>We are one another’s wife, ever begetting</p>

<p>New births of love; we are father, friends,</p>

<p>acquaintance;</p>

<p>We are, in one another, families;</p>

<p>I am your heir, and you are mine. This place</p>

<p>Is our inheritance; no hard oppressor</p>

<p>Dare take this from us; here with a little patience</p>

<p>We shall live long and loving. No surfeits seek us;</p>

<p>The hand of war hurts none here, nor the seas</p>

<p>Swallow their youth. Were we at liberty,</p>

<p>A wife might part us lawfully, or business;</p>

<p>Quarrels consume us; envy of ill men</p>

<p>Crave our acquaintance. I might sicken, cousin,</p>

<p>Where you should never know it, and so perish</p>

<p>Without your noble hand to close mine eyes,</p>

<p>Or prayers to the gods. A thousand chances,</p>

<p>Were we from hence, would sever us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  You have made</p>

<p>me–</p>

<p>I thank you, cousin Arcite–almost wanton</p>

<p>With my captivity. What a misery</p>

<p>It is to live abroad and everywhere!</p>

<p>’Tis like a beast, methinks. I find the court here,</p>

<p>I am sure, a more content; and all those pleasures</p>

<p>That woo the wills of men to vanity</p>

<p>I see through now, and am sufficient</p>

<p>To tell the world ’tis but a gaudy shadow</p>

<p>That old Time as he passes by takes with him.</p>

<p>What had we been, old in the court of Creon,</p>

<p>Where sin is justice, lust and ignorance</p>

<p>The virtues of the great ones? Cousin Arcite,</p>

<p>Had not the loving gods found this place for us,</p>

<p>We had died as they do, ill old men, unwept,</p>

<p>And had their epitaphs, the people’s curses.</p>

<p>Shall I say more?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  I would hear you still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  You shall.</p>

<p>Is there record of any two that loved</p>

<p>Better than we do, Arcite?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Sure there cannot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>I do not think it possible our friendship</p>

<p>Should ever leave us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Till our deaths it cannot.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Emilia and her Woman, below.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>And after death our spirits shall be led</p>

<p>To those that love eternally.     <i><i>[Palamon catches sight</i></p>

<p>of Emilia.]</i></p>

<p>Speak on, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc> <i>[to her Woman]</i></p>

<p>This garden has a world of pleasures in ’t.</p>

<p>What flower is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Woman</sc>  ’Tis called narcissus, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>That was a fair boy certain, but a fool</p>

<p>To love himself. Were there not maids enough?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc> <i>[to Palamon, who is stunned by the sight of Emilia]</i></p>

<p>Pray, forward.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc> <i>[to Woman]</i>  Or were they all hard-hearted?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Woman</sc></p>

<p>They could not be to one so fair.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Thou wouldst not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Woman</sc></p>

<p>I think I should not, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  That’s a good wench.</p>

<p>But take heed to your kindness, though.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Woman</sc>  Why,</p>

<p>madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Men are mad things.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc> <i>[to Palamon]</i>  Will you go forward,</p>

<p>cousin?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc> <i>[to Woman]</i></p>

<p>Canst not thou work such flowers in silk, wench?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Woman</sc>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>I’ll have a gown full of ’em, and of these.</p>

<p>This is pretty color. Will ’t not do</p>

<p>Rarely upon a skirt, wench?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Woman</sc>  Dainty, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc> <i>[to Palamon]</i></p>

<p>Cousin, cousin! How do you, sir? Why, Palamon!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>Never till now I was in prison, Arcite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc></p>

<p>Why, what’s the matter, man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Behold, and wonder!</p>

<p>By heaven, she is a goddess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc> <i>[seeing Emilia]</i>  Ha!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Do reverence.</p>

<p>She is a goddess, Arcite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc> <i>[to Woman]</i>  Of all flowers</p>

<p>Methinks a rose is best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Woman</sc>  Why, gentle madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>It is the very emblem of a maid.</p>

<p>For when the west wind courts her gently,</p>

<p>How modestly she blows and paints the sun</p>

<p>With her chaste blushes! When the north comes</p>

<p>near her,</p>

<p>Rude and impatient, then, like chastity,</p>

<p>She locks her beauties in her bud again,</p>

<p>And leaves him to base briers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Woman</sc>  Yet, good madam,</p>

<p>Sometimes her modesty will blow so far</p>

<p>She falls for ’t. A maid,</p>

<p>If she have any honor, would be loath</p>

<p>To take example by her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Thou art wanton!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc> <i>[to Palamon]</i></p>

<p>She is wondrous fair.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  She is all the beauty extant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc> <i>[to Woman]</i></p>

<p>The sun grows high. Let’s walk in. Keep these</p>

<p>flowers.</p>

<p>We’ll see how near art can come near their colors.</p>

<p>I am wondrous merry-hearted. I could laugh now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Woman</sc></p>

<p>I could lie down, I am sure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  And take one with you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Woman</sc></p>

<p>That’s as we bargain, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Well, agree then.</p>

<p><center><i>[Emilia and Woman exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>What think you of this beauty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  ’Tis a rare one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>Is ’t but a rare one?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Yes, a matchless beauty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>Might not a man well lose himself and love her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc></p>

<p>I cannot tell what you have done; I have,</p>

<p>Beshrew mine eyes for ’t! Now I feel my shackles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>You love her, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Who would not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  And desire her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc></p>

<p>Before my liberty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  I saw her first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc></p>

<p>That’s nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  But it shall be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  I saw her, too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Yes, but you must not love her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc></p>

<p>I will not, as you do, to worship her</p>

<p>As she is heavenly and a blessed goddess.</p>

<p>I love her as a woman, to enjoy her.</p>

<p>So both may love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  You shall not love at all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Not love at all! Who shall deny me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>I, that first saw her; I that took possession</p>

<p>First with mine eye of all those beauties</p>

<p>In her revealed to mankind. If thou lov’st her,</p>

<p>Or entertain’st a hope to blast my wishes,</p>

<p>Thou art a traitor, Arcite, and a fellow</p>

<p>False as thy title to her. Friendship, blood,</p>

<p>And all the ties between us I disclaim</p>

<p>If thou once think upon her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Yes, I love her,</p>

<p>And, if the lives of all my name lay on it,</p>

<p>I must do so. I love her with my soul.</p>

<p>If that will lose you, farewell, Palamon.</p>

<p>I say again, I love, and in loving her maintain</p>

<p>I am as worthy and as free a lover</p>

<p>And have as just a title to her beauty</p>

<p>As any Palamon or any living</p>

<p>That is a man’s son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Have I called thee friend?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc></p>

<p>Yes, and have found me so. Why are you moved</p>

<p>thus?</p>

<p>Let me deal coldly with you: am not I</p>

<p>Part of your blood, part of your soul? You have</p>

<p>told me</p>

<p>That I was Palamon and you were Arcite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Am not I liable to those affections,</p>

<p>Those joys, griefs, angers, fears, my friend shall</p>

<p>suffer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>You may be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Why then would you deal so cunningly,</p>

<p>So strangely, so unlike a noble kinsman,</p>

<p>To love alone? Speak truly, do you think me</p>

<p>Unworthy of her sight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  No, but unjust</p>

<p>If thou pursue that sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Because another</p>

<p>First sees the enemy, shall I stand still</p>

<p>And let mine honor down, and never charge?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>Yes, if he be but one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  But say that one</p>

<p>Had rather combat me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Let that one say so,</p>

<p>And use thy freedom. Else, if thou pursuest her,</p>

<p>Be as that cursed man that hates his country,</p>

<p>A branded villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  You are mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  I must be.</p>

<p>Till thou art worthy, Arcite, it concerns me.</p>

<p>And in this madness if I hazard thee</p>

<p>And take thy life, I deal but truly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Fie, sir!</p>

<p>You play the child extremely. I will love her;</p>

<p>I must, I ought to do so, and I dare,</p>

<p>And all this justly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  O, that now, that now,</p>

<p>Thy false self and thy friend had but this fortune</p>

<p>To be one hour at liberty, and grasp</p>

<p>Our good swords in our hands, I would quickly</p>

<p>teach thee</p>

<p>What ’twere to filch affection from another.</p>

<p>Thou art baser in it than a cutpurse.</p>

<p>Put but thy head out of this window more</p>

<p>And, as I have a soul, I’ll nail thy life to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc></p>

<p>Thou dar’st not, fool; thou canst not; thou art feeble.</p>

<p>Put my head out? I’ll throw my body out</p>

<p>And leap the garden when I see her next,</p>

<p>And pitch between her arms to anger thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Jailer, above.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>No more; the keeper’s coming. I shall live</p>

<p>To knock thy brains out with my shackles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  Do!</p>

<p>The cause I know not yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arcite</sc>  I am ready, keeper.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc></p>

<p>Prince Palamon, I must awhile bereave you</p>

<p>Of your fair cousin’s company.</p>

<p><center><i>[Arcite and Jailer exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  And me too,</p>

<p>Even when you please, of life.–Why is he sent for?</p>

<p>It may be he shall marry her; he’s goodly,</p>

<p>And like enough the Duke hath taken notice</p>

<p>Both of his blood and body. But his falsehood!</p>

<p>Why should a friend be treacherous? If that</p>

<p>Get him a wife so noble and so fair,</p>

<p>Let honest men ne’er love again. Once more</p>

<p>I would but see this fair one. Blessed garden</p>

<p>And fruit and flowers more blessed that still</p>

<p>blossom</p>

<p>As her bright eyes shine on you, would I were,</p>

<p>For all the fortune of my life hereafter,</p>

<p>Yon little tree, yon blooming apricock!</p>

<p>How I would spread and fling my wanton arms</p>

<p>In at her window; I would bring her fruit</p>

<p>Fit for the gods to feed on; youth and pleasure</p>

<p>Still as she tasted should be doubled on her;</p>

<p>And, if she be not heavenly, I would make her</p>

<p>So near the gods in nature, they should fear her.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Jailer, above.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>And then I am sure she would love me.–How now,</p>

<p>keeper,</p>

<p>Where’s Arcite?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Banished. Prince Pirithous</p>

<p>Obtained his liberty, but never more</p>

<p>Upon his oath and life must he set foot</p>

<p>Upon this kingdom.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  He’s a blessed man.</p>

<p>He shall see Thebes again, and call to arms</p>

<p>The bold young men that, when he bids ’em charge,</p>

<p>Fall on like fire. Arcite shall have a fortune,</p>

<p>If he dare make himself a worthy lover,</p>

<p>Yet in the field to strike a battle for her,</p>

<p>And, if he lose her then, he’s a cold coward.</p>

<p>How bravely may he bear himself to win her</p>

<p>If he be noble Arcite–thousand ways!</p>

<p>Were I at liberty, I would do things</p>

<p>Of such a virtuous greatness that this lady,</p>

<p>This blushing virgin, should take manhood to her</p>

<p>And seek to ravish me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  My lord, for you</p>

<p>I have this charge to–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  To discharge my life?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc></p>

<p>No, but from this place to remove your Lordship;</p>

<p>The windows are too open.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Devils take ’em</p>

<p>That are so envious to me! Prithee, kill me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc></p>

<p>And hang for ’t afterward!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  By this good light,</p>

<p>Had I a sword I would kill thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Why, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc></p>

<p>Thou bringst such pelting, scurvy news continually,</p>

<p>Thou art not worthy life. I will not go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc></p>

<p>Indeed you must, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  May I see the garden?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc></p>

<p>No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Then I am resolved, I will not go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc></p>

<p>I must constrain you then; and, for you are</p>

<p>dangerous,</p>

<p>I’ll clap more irons on you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Do, good keeper.</p>

<p>I’ll shake ’em so, you shall not sleep;</p>

<p>I’ll make you a new morris. Must I go?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc></p>

<p>There is no remedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Palamon</sc>  Farewell, kind window.</p>

<p>May rude wind never hurt thee. O, my lady,</p>

<p>If ever thou hast felt what sorrow was,</p>

<p>Dream how I suffer.–Come; now bury me.</p>
