<p><center><i>[Enter Arcite.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>Banished the kingdom? ’Tis a benefit,</p>

<p>A mercy I must thank ’em for; but banished</p>

<p>The free enjoying of that face I die for,</p>

<p>O, ’twas a studied punishment, a death</p>

<p>Beyond imagination–such a vengeance</p>

<p>That, were I old and wicked, all my sins</p>

<p>Could never pluck upon me. Palamon,</p>

<p>Thou hast the start now; thou shalt stay and see</p>

<p>Her bright eyes break each morning ’gainst thy</p>

<p>window</p>

<p>And let in life into thee; thou shalt feed</p>

<p>Upon the sweetness of a noble beauty</p>

<p>That nature ne’er exceeded nor ne’er shall.</p>

<p>Good gods, what happiness has Palamon!</p>

<p>Twenty to one he’ll come to speak to her,</p>

<p>And if she be as gentle as she’s fair,</p>

<p>I know she’s his. He has a tongue will tame</p>

<p>Tempests and make the wild rocks wanton.</p>

<p>Come what can come,</p>

<p>The worst is death. I will not leave the kingdom.</p>

<p>I know mine own is but a heap of ruins,</p>

<p>And no redress there. If I go, he has her.</p>

<p>I am resolved another shape shall make me</p>

<p>Or end my fortunes. Either way I am happy.</p>

<p>I’ll see her and be near her, or no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter four Country people, and one with</p>

<p>a garland before them.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Arcite steps aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  My masters, I’ll be there, that’s</p>

<p>certain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  And I’ll be there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  And I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fourth</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  Why, then, have with you, boys.</p>

<p>’Tis but a chiding. Let the plough play today; I’ll</p>

<p>tickle ’t out of the jades’ tails tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  I am sure to have my wife as jealous</p>

<p>as a turkey, but that’s all one. I’ll go through;</p>

<p>let her mumble.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  Clap her aboard tomorrow night</p>

<p>and stow her, and all’s made up again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  Ay, do but put a fescue in her fist</p>

<p>and you shall see her take a new lesson out and be</p>

<p>a good wench. Do we all hold against the Maying?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fourth</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  Hold? What should ail us?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  Arcas will be there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  And Sennois and Rycas; and</p>

<p>three better lads ne’er danced under green tree.</p>

<p>And you know what wenches, ha! But will the</p>

<p>dainty domine, the Schoolmaster, keep touch, do</p>

<p>you think? For he does all, you know.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  He’ll eat a hornbook ere he fail.</p>

<p>Go to, the matter’s too far driven between him and</p>

<p>the tanner’s daughter to let slip now; and she must</p>

<p>see the Duke, and she must dance too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fourth</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  Shall we be lusty?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  All the boys in Athens blow wind</p>

<p>i’ th’ breech on ’s. And here I’ll be and there I’ll be,</p>

<p>for our town, and here again, and there again. Ha,</p>

<p>boys, hey for the weavers!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  This must be done i’ th’ woods.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fourth</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  O pardon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  By any means; our thing of learning</p>

<p>says so–where he himself will edify the Duke</p>

<p>most parlously in our behalfs. He’s excellent i’ th’</p>

<p>woods; bring him to th’ plains, his learning makes</p>

<p>no cry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  We’ll see the sports, then every</p>

<p>man to ’s tackle. And, sweet companions, let’s rehearse,</p>

<p>by any means, before the ladies see us, and</p>

<p>do sweetly, and God knows what may come on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fourth</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  Content. The sports once ended,</p>

<p>we’ll perform. Away, boys, and hold.</p>

<p><center><i>[Arcite comes forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  By your leaves, honest friends: pray you,</p>

<p>whither go you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fourth</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  Whither?</p>

<p>Why, what a question’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Yes, ’tis a question</p>

<p>To me that know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  To the games, my friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span></p>

<p>Where were you bred, you know it not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Not far, sir.</p>

<p>Are there such games today?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  Yes, marry, are there,</p>

<p>And such as you never saw. The Duke himself</p>

<p>Will be in person there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  What pastimes are they?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span></p>

<p>Wrestling and running.–’Tis a pretty fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span></p>

<p>Thou wilt not go along?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span>  Not yet, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fourth</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span>  Well, sir,</p>

<p>Take your own time.–Come, boys.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span> <i>[aside to the others]</i>  My mind misgives</p>

<p>me. This fellow has a vengeance trick o’ th’</p>

<p>hip. Mark how his body’s made for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Countryman</span> <i>[aside to the others]</i>  I’ll be</p>

<p>hanged, though, if he dare venture. Hang him,</p>

<p>plum porridge! He wrestle? He roast eggs! Come,</p>

<p>let’s be gone, lads.     <i><i>[The four exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arcite</span></p>

<p>This is an offered opportunity</p>

<p>I durst not wish for. Well I could have wrestled–</p>

<p>The best men called it excellent–and run</p>

<p>Swifter than wind upon a field of corn,</p>

<p>Curling the wealthy ears, never flew. I’ll venture,</p>

<p>And in some poor disguise be there. Who knows</p>

<p>Whether my brows may not be girt with garlands,</p>

<p>And happiness prefer me to a place</p>

<p>Where I may ever dwell in sight of her?</p>
