<p><center><i>[Enter Pirithous, Hippolyta, Emilia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span></p>

<p>No further.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  Sir, farewell. Repeat my wishes</p>

<p>To our great lord, of whose success I dare not</p>

<p>Make any timorous question; yet I wish him</p>

<p>Excess and overflow of power, an ’t might be,</p>

<p>To dure ill-dealing fortune. Speed to him.</p>

<p>Store never hurts good governors.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span>  Though I know</p>

<p>His ocean needs not my poor drops, yet they</p>

<p>Must yield their tribute there.–My precious maid,</p>

<p>Those best affections that the heavens infuse</p>

<p>In their best-tempered pieces keep enthroned</p>

<p>In your dear heart!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Thanks, sir. Remember me</p>

<p>To our all-royal brother, for whose speed</p>

<p>The great Bellona I’ll solicit; and</p>

<p>Since in our terrene state petitions are not</p>

<p>Without gifts understood, I’ll offer to her</p>

<p>What I shall be advised she likes. Our hearts</p>

<p>Are in his army, in his tent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  In ’s bosom.</p>

<p>We have been soldiers, and we cannot weep</p>

<p>When our friends don their helms or put to sea,</p>

<p>Or tell of babes broached on the lance, or women</p>

<p>That have sod their infants in–and after ate them–</p>

<p>The brine they wept at killing ’em. Then if</p>

<p>You stay to see of us such spinsters, we</p>

<p>Should hold you here forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirithous</span>  Peace be to you</p>

<p>As I pursue this war, which shall be then</p>

<p>Beyond further requiring.     <i><i>[Pirithous exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  How his longing</p>

<p>Follows his friend! Since his depart, his sports,</p>

<p>Though craving seriousness and skill, passed slightly</p>

<p>His careless execution, where nor gain</p>

<p>Made him regard, or loss consider, but</p>

<p>Playing one business in his hand, another</p>

<p>Directing in his head, his mind nurse equal</p>

<p>To these so diff’ring twins. Have you observed him</p>

<p>Since our great lord departed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  With much labor,</p>

<p>And I did love him for ’t. They two have cabined</p>

<p>In many as dangerous as poor a corner,</p>

<p>Peril and want contending; they have skiffed</p>

<p>Torrents whose roaring tyranny and power</p>

<p>I’ th’ least of these was dreadful, and they have</p>

<p>Fought out together where Death’s self was lodged.</p>

<p>Yet fate hath brought them off. Their knot of love,</p>

<p>Tied, weaved, entangled, with so true, so long,</p>

<p>And with a finger of so deep a cunning,</p>

<p>May be outworn, never undone. I think</p>

<p>Theseus cannot be umpire to himself,</p>

<p>Cleaving his conscience into twain and doing</p>

<p>Each side like justice, which he loves best.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Doubtless</p>

<p>There is a best, and reason has no manners</p>

<p>To say it is not you. I was acquainted</p>

<p>Once with a time when I enjoyed a playfellow;</p>

<p>You were at wars when she the grave enriched,</p>

<p>Who made too proud the bed; took leave o’ th’ moon,</p>

<p>Which then looked pale at parting, when our count</p>

<p>Was each eleven.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  ’Twas Flavina.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Yes.</p>

<p>You talk of Pirithous’ and Theseus’ love.</p>

<p>Theirs has more ground, is more maturely seasoned,</p>

<p>More buckled with strong judgment, and their needs</p>

<p>The one of th’ other may be said to water</p>

<p>Their intertangled roots of love. But I,</p>

<p>And she I sigh and spoke of, were things innocent,</p>

<p>Loved for we did, and like the elements</p>

<p>That know not what nor why, yet do effect</p>

<p>Rare issues by their operance, our souls</p>

<p>Did so to one another. What she liked</p>

<p>Was then of me approved, what not, condemned,</p>

<p>No more arraignment. The flower that I would pluck</p>

<p>And put between my breasts–O, then but beginning</p>

<p>To swell about the blossom–she would long</p>

<p>Till she had such another, and commit it</p>

<p>To the like innocent cradle, where, Phoenix-like,</p>

<p>They died in perfume. On my head no toy</p>

<p>But was her pattern; her affections–pretty,</p>

<p>Though haply hers careless were–I followed</p>

<p>For my most serious decking. Had mine ear</p>

<p>Stol’n some new air, or at adventure hummed one</p>

<p>From musical coinage, why, it was a note</p>

<p>Whereon her spirits would sojourn–rather, dwell</p>

<p>on–</p>

<p>And sing it in her slumbers. This rehearsal–</p>

<p>Which fury-innocent wots well comes in</p>

<p>Like old importment’s bastard–has this end,</p>

<p>That the true love ’tween maid and maid may be</p>

<p>More than in sex individual.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  You’re out of breath,</p>

<p>And this high-speeded pace is but to say</p>

<p>That you shall never–like the maid Flavina–</p>

<p>Love any that’s called man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  I am sure I shall not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  Now, alack, weak sister,</p>

<p>I must no more believe thee in this point–</p>

<p>Though in ’t I know thou dost believe thyself–</p>

<p>Than I will trust a sickly appetite,</p>

<p>That loathes even as it longs. But sure, my sister,</p>

<p>If I were ripe for your persuasion, you</p>

<p>Have said enough to shake me from the arm</p>

<p>Of the all-noble Theseus, for whose fortunes</p>

<p>I will now in and kneel, with great assurance</p>

<p>That we, more than his Pirithous, possess</p>

<p>The high throne in his heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  I am not</p>

<p>Against your faith, yet I continue mine.</p>
