<p><center><i>[Music. Enter Hymen with a torch burning, a Boy in</p>

<p>a white robe before, singing and strewing flowers.</p>

<p>After Hymen, a Nymph encompassed in her tresses,</p>

<p>bearing a wheaten garland; then Theseus between</p>

<p>two other Nymphs with wheaten chaplets on their</p>

<p>heads. Then Hippolyta, the bride, led by Pirithous,</p>

<p>up her train. Then Artesius and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>The Song, sung by the Boy.</p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>Roses, their sharp spines being gone,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Not royal in their smells alone,</i></p>

<p>        <i>But in their hue;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Maiden pinks, of odor faint,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Daisies smell-less, yet most quaint,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And sweet thyme true;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Primrose, firstborn child of Ver,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Merry springtime’s harbinger,</i></p>

<p>        <i>With her bells dim;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Oxlips in their cradles growing,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Marigolds on deathbeds blowing,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Lark’s-heels trim;</i></p>

<p>     <i>All dear Nature’s children sweet</i></p>

<p>     <i>Lie ’fore bride and bridegroom’s feet,</i></p>

<p><center><i>[Strew flowers.]</i></center></p>

<p>        <i>Blessing their sense.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Not an angel of the air,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Bird melodious or bird fair,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Is absent hence.</i></p>

<p>     <i>The crow, the sland’rous cuckoo, nor</i></p>

<p>     <i>The boding raven, nor chough hoar,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Nor chatt’ring pie,</i></p>

<p>imperial crowns. The first Queen falls down at the foot</p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span> <i>[to Theseus]</i></p>

<p>For pity’s sake and true gentility’s,</p>

<p>Hear and respect me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span> <i>[to Hippolyta]</i>  For your mother’s sake,</p>

<p>And as you wish your womb may thrive with fair</p>

<p>ones,</p>

<p>Hear and respect me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span> <i>[to Emilia]</i></p>

<p>Now for the love of him whom Jove hath marked</p>

<p>The honor of your bed, and for the sake</p>

<p>Of clear virginity, be advocate</p>

<p>For us and our distresses. This good deed</p>

<p>Shall raze you out o’ th’ book of trespasses</p>

<p>All you are set down there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span> <i>[to First Queen]</i></p>

<p>Sad lady, rise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span> <i>[to Second Queen]</i>  Stand up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span> <i>[to Third Queen]</i>  No knees to me.</p>

<p>What woman I may stead that is distressed</p>

<p>Does bind me to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span> <i>[to First Queen]</i></p>

<p>What’s your request? Deliver you for all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>We are three queens whose sovereigns fell before</p>

<p>The wrath of cruel Creon; who endured</p>

<p>The beaks of ravens, talons of the kites,</p>

<p>And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes.</p>

<p>He will not suffer us to burn their bones,</p>

<p>To urn their ashes, nor to take th’ offense</p>

<p>Of mortal loathsomeness from the blest eye</p>

<p>Of holy Phoebus, but infects the winds</p>

<p>With stench of our slain lords. O, pity, duke!</p>

<p>Thou purger of the Earth, draw thy feared sword</p>

<p>That does good turns to th’ world; give us the bones</p>

<p>Of our dead kings, that we may chapel them;</p>

<p>And of thy boundless goodness take some note</p>

<p>That for our crowned heads we have no roof</p>

<p>Save this, which is the lion’s and the bear’s,</p>

<p>And vault to everything.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  Pray you, kneel not.</p>

<p>I was transported with your speech and suffered</p>

<p>Your knees to wrong themselves. I have heard the</p>

<p>fortunes</p>

<p>Of your dead lords, which gives me such lamenting</p>

<p>As wakes my vengeance and revenge for ’em.</p>

<p>King Capaneus was your lord. The day</p>

<p>That he should marry you, at such a season</p>

<p>As now it is with me, I met your groom</p>

<p>By Mars’s altar. You were that time fair–</p>

<p>Not Juno’s mantle fairer than your tresses,</p>

<p>Nor in more bounty spread her. Your wheaten</p>

<p>wreath</p>

<p>Was then nor threshed nor blasted. Fortune at you</p>

<p>Dimpled her cheek with smiles. Hercules, our</p>

<p>kinsman,</p>

<p>Then weaker than your eyes, laid by his club;</p>

<p>He tumbled down upon his Nemean hide</p>

<p>And swore his sinews thawed. O grief and time,</p>

<p>Fearful consumers, you will all devour!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  O, I hope some god,</p>

<p>Some god hath put his mercy in your manhood,</p>

<p>Whereto he’ll infuse power, and press you forth</p>

<p>Our undertaker.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  O, no knees, none, widow!</p>

<p>Unto the helmeted Bellona use them</p>

<p>And pray for me, your soldier.     <i><i>[The First Queen rises.]</i></i></p>

<p>Troubled I am.     <i><i>[Turns away.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  Honored Hippolyta,</p>

<p>Most dreaded Amazonian, that hast slain</p>

<p>The scythe-tusked boar; that with thy arm, as strong</p>

<p>As it is white, wast near to make the male</p>

<p>To thy sex captive, but that this thy lord,</p>

<p>Born to uphold creation in that honor</p>

<p>First nature styled it in, shrunk thee into</p>

<p>The bound thou wast o’erflowing, at once subduing</p>

<p>Thy force and thy affection; soldieress</p>

<p>That equally canst poise sternness with pity,</p>

<p>Whom now I know hast much more power on him</p>

<p>Than ever he had on thee, who ow’st his strength</p>

<p>And his love too, who is a servant for</p>

<p>The tenor of thy speech, dear glass of ladies,</p>

<p>Bid him that we, whom flaming war doth scorch,</p>

<p>Under the shadow of his sword may cool us;</p>

<p>Require him he advance it o’er our heads;</p>

<p>Speak ’t in a woman’s key, like such a woman</p>

<p>As any of us three; weep ere you fail.</p>

<p>Lend us a knee;</p>

<p>But touch the ground for us no longer time</p>

<p>Than a dove’s motion when the head’s plucked off.</p>

<p>Tell him if he i’ th’ blood-sized field lay swoll’n,</p>

<p>Showing the sun his teeth, grinning at the moon,</p>

<p>What you would do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span>  Poor lady, say no more.</p>

<p>I had as lief trace this good action with you</p>

<p>As that whereto I am going, and never yet</p>

<p>Went I so willing way. My lord is taken</p>

<p>Heart-deep with your distress; let him consider.</p>

<p>I’ll speak anon.     <i><i>[Second Queen rises.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  O, my petition was</p>

<p>Set down in ice, which by hot grief uncandied</p>

<p>Melts into drops; so sorrow, wanting form,</p>

<p>Is pressed with deeper matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Pray stand up.</p>

<p>Your grief is written in your cheek.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  O, woe!</p>

<p>You cannot read it there.     <i><i>[She rises.]</i></i></p>

<p>There through my tears,</p>

<p>Like wrinkled pebbles in a glassy stream,</p>

<p>You may behold ’em. Lady, lady, alack!</p>

<p>He that will all the treasure know o’ th’ Earth</p>

<p>Must know the center too; he that will fish</p>

<p>For my least minnow, let him lead his line</p>

<p>To catch one at my heart. O, pardon me!</p>

<p>Extremity, that sharpens sundry wits,</p>

<p>Makes me a fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Pray you say nothing, pray you.</p>

<p>Who cannot feel nor see the rain, being in ’t,</p>

<p>Knows neither wet nor dry. If that you were</p>

<p>The groundpiece of some painter, I would buy you</p>

<p>T’ instruct me ’gainst a capital grief–indeed,</p>

<p>Such heart-pierced demonstration. But, alas,</p>

<p>Being a natural sister of our sex,</p>

<p>Your sorrow beats so ardently upon me</p>

<p>That it shall make a counter-reflect ’gainst</p>

<p>My brother’s heart and warm it to some pity,</p>

<p>Though it were made of stone. Pray have good</p>

<p>comfort.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span> <i>[coming forward]</i></p>

<p>Forward to th’ temple. Leave not out a jot</p>

<p>O’ th’ sacred ceremony.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  O, this celebration</p>

<p>Will longer last and be more costly than</p>

<p>Your suppliants’ war. Remember that your fame</p>

<p>Knolls in the ear o’ th’ world; what you do quickly</p>

<p>Is not done rashly; your first thought is more</p>

<p>Than others’ labored meditance, your premeditating</p>

<p>More than their actions. But, O Jove, your actions,</p>

<p>Soon as they move, as ospreys do the fish,</p>

<p>Subdue before they touch. Think, dear duke, think</p>

<p>What beds our slain kings have!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  What griefs our beds,</p>

<p>That our dear lords have none!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  None fit for th’ dead.</p>

<p>Those that with cords, knives, drams, precipitance,</p>

<p>Weary of this world’s light, have to themselves</p>

<p>Been death’s most horrid agents, human grace</p>

<p>Affords them dust and shadow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  But our lords</p>

<p>Lie blist’ring ’fore the visitating sun,</p>

<p>And were good kings when living.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>It is true, and I will give you comfort</p>

<p>To give your dead lords graves;</p>

<p>The which to do must make some work with Creon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>And that work presents itself to th’ doing.</p>

<p>Now ’twill take form; the heats are gone tomorrow.</p>

<p>Then, bootless toil must recompense itself</p>

<p>With its own sweat. Now he’s secure,</p>

<p>Not dreams we stand before your puissance,</p>

<p>Rinsing our holy begging in our eyes</p>

<p>To make petition clear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  Now you may take him,</p>

<p>Drunk with his victory.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  And his army full</p>

<p>Of bread and sloth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  Artesius, that best knowest</p>

<p>How to draw out, fit to this enterprise,</p>

<p>The prim’st for this proceeding, and the number</p>

<p>To carry such a business: forth and levy</p>

<p>Our worthiest instruments, whilst we dispatch</p>

<p>This grand act of our life, this daring deed</p>

<p>Of fate in wedlock.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span> <i>[to Second and Third Queens]</i></p>

<p>Dowagers, take hands.</p>

<p>Let us be widows to our woes. Delay</p>

<p>Commends us to a famishing hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>The</span> <span class='sc'>Queens</span>  Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>We come unseasonably; but when could grief</p>

<p>Cull forth, as unpanged judgment can, fitt’st time</p>

<p>For best solicitation?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  Why, good ladies,</p>

<p>This is a service whereto I am going</p>

<p>Greater than any was; it more imports me</p>

<p>Than all the actions that I have foregone,</p>

<p>Or futurely can cope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  The more proclaiming</p>

<p>Our suit shall be neglected when her arms,</p>

<p>Able to lock Jove from a synod, shall</p>

<p>By warranting moonlight corselet thee. O, when</p>

<p>Her twinning cherries shall their sweetness fall</p>

<p>Upon thy tasteful lips, what wilt thou think</p>

<p>Of rotten kings or blubbered queens? What care</p>

<p>For what thou feel’st not, what thou feel’st being</p>

<p>able</p>

<p>To make Mars spurn his drum? O, if thou couch</p>

<p>But one night with her, every hour in ’t will</p>

<p>Take hostage of thee for a hundred, and</p>

<p>Thou shalt remember nothing more than what</p>

<p>That banquet bids thee to.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span> <i>[to Theseus]</i>  Though much unlike</p>

<p>You should be so transported, as much sorry</p>

<p>I should be such a suitor, yet I think</p>

<p>Did I not, by th’ abstaining of my joy–</p>

<p>Which breeds a deeper longing–cure their surfeit</p>

<p>That craves a present med’cine, I should pluck</p>

<p>All ladies’ scandal on me.     <i><i>[She kneels.]</i></i></p>

<p>Therefore, sir,</p>

<p>As I shall here make trial of my prayers,</p>

<p>Either presuming them to have some force,</p>

<p>Or sentencing for aye their vigor dumb,</p>

<p>Prorogue this business we are going about, and</p>

<p>hang</p>

<p>Your shield afore your heart–about that neck</p>

<p>Which is my fee, and which I freely lend</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>Queens</span> <i>[to Emilia]</i>  O, help now!</p>

<p>In the pretended celebration.–Queens,</p>

<p>Follow your soldier. <i>[To Artesius.]</i> As before, hence</p>

<p>you,</p>

<p>And at the banks of Aulis meet us with</p>
