<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  I may depart with little while I live; something I</p>

<p>may cast to you, not much. Alas, the prison I keep,</p>

<p>though it be for great ones, yet they seldom come;</p>

<p>before one salmon you shall take a number of minnows.</p>

<p>I am given out to be better lined than it can</p>

<p>appear to me report is a true speaker. I would I</p>

<p>were really that I am delivered to be. Marry, what</p>

<p>I have, be it what it will, I will assure upon my</p>

<p>daughter at the day of my death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span>  Sir, I demand no more than your own offer,</p>

<p>and I will estate your daughter in what I have</p>

<p>promised.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  Well, we will talk more of this when the solemnity</p>

<p>is past. But have you a full promise of her?</p>

<p>When that shall be seen, I tender my consent.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Jailer’s Daughter, carrying rushes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span>  I have sir. Here she comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span> <i>[to Daughter]</i>  Your friend and I have chanced</p>

<p>to name you here, upon the old business. But no</p>

<p>more of that now; so soon as the court hurry is</p>

<p>over, we will have an end of it. I’ th’ meantime,</p>

<p>look tenderly to the two prisoners. I can tell you</p>

<p>they are princes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  These strewings are for their chamber. ’Tis</p>

<p>pity they are in prison, and ’twere pity they should</p>

<p>be out. I do think they have patience to make any</p>

<p>adversity ashamed. The prison itself is proud of</p>

<p>’em, and they have all the world in their chamber.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  They are famed to be a pair of absolute men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  By my troth, I think fame but stammers</p>

<p>’em. They stand a grise above the reach of report.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  I heard them reported in the battle to be the</p>

<p>only doers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  Nay, most likely, for they are noble suff’rers.</p>

<p>I marvel how they would have looked had they</p>

<p>been victors, that with such a constant nobility enforce</p>

<p>a freedom out of bondage, making misery</p>

<p>their mirth and affliction a toy to jest at.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  Do they so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  It seems to me they have no more sense</p>

<p>of their captivity than I of ruling Athens. They eat</p>

<p>well, look merrily, discourse of many things, but</p>

<p>nothing of their own restraint and disasters. Yet</p>

<p>sometimes a divided sigh, martyred as ’twere i’ th’</p>

<p>deliverance, will break from one of them–when</p>

<p>the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that</p>

<p>I could wish myself a sigh to be so chid, or at least</p>

<p>a sigher to be comforted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Wooer</span>  I never saw ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  The Duke himself came privately in the night,</p>

<p>and so did they.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Palamon and Arcite, in shackles, above.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What the reason of it is, I know not. Look, yonder</p>

<p>they are; that’s Arcite looks out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  No, sir, no, that’s Palamon. Arcite is the</p>

<p>lower of the twain; you may perceive a part of</p>

<p>him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  Go to, leave your pointing; they would not</p>

<p>make us their object. Out of their sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Daughter</span>  It is a holiday to look on them. Lord, the</p>

<p>diff’rence of men!</p>
