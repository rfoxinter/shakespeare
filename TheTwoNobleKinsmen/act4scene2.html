<p><center><i>[Enter Emilia alone, with two pictures.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Yet I may bind those wounds up that must open</p>

<p>And bleed to death for my sake else. I’ll choose,</p>

<p>And end their strife. Two such young handsome men</p>

<p>Shall never fall for me; their weeping mothers,</p>

<p>Following the dead cold ashes of their sons,</p>

<p>Shall never curse my cruelty.</p>

<p><center><i>[Looks at one of the pictures.]</i></center></p>

<p>Good heaven,</p>

<p>What a sweet face has Arcite! If wise Nature,</p>

<p>With all her best endowments, all those beauties</p>

<p>She sows into the births of noble bodies,</p>

<p>Were here a mortal woman, and had in her</p>

<p>The coy denials of young maids, yet doubtless</p>

<p>She would run mad for this man. What an eye,</p>

<p>Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness,</p>

<p>Has this young prince! Here Love himself sits</p>

<p>smiling;</p>

<p>Just such another wanton Ganymede</p>

<p>Set Jove afire with, and enforced the god</p>

<p>Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,</p>

<p>A shining constellation. What a brow,</p>

<p>Of what a spacious majesty, he carries,</p>

<p>Arched like the great-eyed Juno’s but far sweeter,</p>

<p>Smoother than Pelops’ shoulder! Fame and Honor,</p>

<p>Methinks, from hence as from a promontory</p>

<p>Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings and sing</p>

<p>To all the under world the loves and fights</p>

<p>Of gods and such men near ’em.</p>

<p><center><i>[Looks at the other picture.]</i></center></p>

<p>Palamon</p>

<p>Is but his foil, to him a mere dull shadow;</p>

<p>He’s swart and meager, of an eye as heavy</p>

<p>As if he had lost his mother; a still temper,</p>

<p>No stirring in him, no alacrity;</p>

<p>Of all this sprightly sharpness not a smile.</p>

<p>Yet these that we count errors may become him;</p>

<p>Narcissus was a sad boy but a heavenly.</p>

<p>O, who can find the bent of woman’s fancy?</p>

<p>I am a fool; my reason is lost in me;</p>

<p>I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly</p>

<p>That women ought to beat me. On my knees</p>

<p>I ask thy pardon: Palamon, thou art alone</p>

<p>And only beautiful, and these the eyes,</p>

<p>These the bright lamps of beauty, that command</p>

<p>And threaten love, and what young maid dare cross</p>

<p>’em?</p>

<p>What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,</p>

<p>Has this brown manly face! O Love, this only</p>

<p>From this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite.</p>

<p><center><i>[She puts aside his picture.]</i></center></p>

<p>Thou art a changeling to him, a mere gypsy,</p>

<p>And this the noble body. I am sotted,</p>

<p>Utterly lost. My virgin’s faith has fled me.</p>

<p>For if my brother but even now had asked me</p>

<p>Whether I loved, I had run mad for Arcite.</p>

<p>Now, if my sister, more for Palamon.</p>

<p>Stand both together. Now, come ask me, brother.</p>

<p>Alas, I know not! Ask me now, sweet sister.</p>

<p>I may go look! What a mere child is Fancy,</p>

<p>That, having two fair gauds of equal sweetness,</p>

<p>Cannot distinguish, but must cry for both.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  From the noble duke, your brother,</p>

<p>Madam, I bring you news: the knights are come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>To end the quarrel?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Would I might end first!</p>

<p>What sins have I committed, chaste Diana,</p>

<p>That my unspotted youth must now be soiled</p>

<p>With blood of princes, and my chastity</p>

<p>Be made the altar where the lives of lovers–</p>

<p>Two greater and two better never yet</p>

<p>Made mothers joy–must be the sacrifice</p>

<p>To my unhappy beauty?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc> <i>[to Attendant]</i>  Bring ’em in</p>

<p>Quickly, by any means; I long to see ’em.</p>

<p><i>[To Emilia.]</i> Your two contending lovers are</p>

<p>returned,</p>

<p>And with them their fair knights. Now, my fair</p>

<p>sister,</p>

<p>You must love one of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  I had rather both,</p>

<p>So neither for my sake should fall untimely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Who saw ’em?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc>  I awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  And I.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>From whence come you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  From the knights.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  Pray</p>

<p>speak,</p>

<p>You that have seen them, what they are.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  I will, sir,</p>

<p>And truly what I think. Six braver spirits</p>

<p>Than these they have brought, if we judge by the</p>

<p>outside,</p>

<p>I never saw nor read of. He that stands</p>

<p>In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming,</p>

<p>Should be a stout man, by his face a prince–</p>

<p>His very looks so say him; his complexion</p>

<p>Nearer a brown than black–stern and yet noble–</p>

<p>Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers;</p>

<p>The circles of his eyes show fire within him,</p>

<p>And as a heated lion, so he looks.</p>

<p>His hair hangs long behind him, black and shining</p>

<p>Like ravens’ wings; his shoulders broad and strong,</p>

<p>Armed long and round; and on his thigh a sword</p>

<p>Hung by a curious baldric, when he frowns</p>

<p>To seal his will with. Better, o’ my conscience,</p>

<p>Was never soldier’s friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Thou hast well described him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc>  Yet a great</p>

<p>deal short,</p>

<p>Methinks, of him that’s first with Palamon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Pray speak him, friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc>  I guess he is a prince too,</p>

<p>And, if it may be, greater; for his show</p>

<p>Has all the ornament of honor in ’t:</p>

<p>He’s somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of,</p>

<p>But of a face far sweeter; his complexion</p>

<p>Is, as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has felt</p>

<p>Without doubt what he fights for, and so apter</p>

<p>To make this cause his own. In ’s face appears</p>

<p>All the fair hopes of what he undertakes,</p>

<p>And when he’s angry, then a settled valor,</p>

<p>Not tainted with extremes, runs through his body</p>

<p>And guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot;</p>

<p>He shows no such soft temper. His head’s yellow,</p>

<p>Hard-haired and curled, thick-twined like ivy tods,</p>

<p>Not to undo with thunder. In his face</p>

<p>The livery of the warlike maid appears,</p>

<p>Pure red and white, for yet no beard has blessed him.</p>

<p>And in his rolling eyes sits Victory,</p>

<p>As if she ever meant to crown his valor.</p>

<p>His nose stands high, a character of honor;</p>

<p>His red lips, after fights, are fit for ladies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Must these men die too?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc>  When he speaks, his tongue</p>

<p>Sounds like a trumpet. All his lineaments</p>

<p>Are as a man would wish ’em, strong and clean.</p>

<p>He wears a well-steeled axe, the staff of gold;</p>

<p>His age some five-and-twenty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  There’s another–</p>

<p>A little man, but of a tough soul, seeming</p>

<p>As great as any; fairer promises</p>

<p>In such a body yet I never looked on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc></p>

<p>O, he that’s freckle-faced?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  The same, my lord.</p>

<p>Are they not sweet ones?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc>  Yes, they are well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  Methinks,</p>

<p>Being so few, and well disposed, they show</p>

<p>Great and fine art in nature. He’s white-haired–</p>

<p>Not wanton white, but such a manly color</p>

<p>Next to an auburn; tough and nimble-set,</p>

<p>Which shows an active soul. His arms are brawny,</p>

<p>Lined with strong sinews–to the shoulder-piece</p>

<p>Gently they swell, like women new-conceived,</p>

<p>Which speaks him prone to labor, never fainting</p>

<p>Under the weight of arms; stout-hearted still,</p>

<p>But when he stirs, a tiger. He’s grey-eyed,</p>

<p>Which yields compassion where he conquers; sharp</p>

<p>To spy advantages, and where he finds ’em,</p>

<p>He’s swift to make ’em his. He does no wrongs,</p>

<p>Nor takes none. He’s round-faced, and when he</p>

<p>smiles</p>

<p>He shows a lover; when he frowns, a soldier.</p>

<p>About his head he wears the winner’s oak,</p>

<p>And in it stuck the favor of his lady.</p>

<p>His age some six-and-thirty. In his hand</p>

<p>He bears a charging-staff embossed with silver.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Are they all thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc>  They are all the sons of honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Now, as I have a soul, I long to see ’em.–</p>

<p>Lady, you shall see men fight now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc>  I wish it,</p>

<p>But not the cause, my lord. They would show</p>

<p>Bravely about the titles of two kingdoms;</p>

<p>’Tis pity love should be so tyrannous.–</p>

<p>O, my soft-hearted sister, what think you?</p>

<p>Weep not till they weep blood. Wench, it must be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc> <i>[to Emilia]</i></p>

<p>You have steeled ’em with your beauty. <i>[(To</p>

<p>Pirithous.)]</i> Honored friend,</p>

<p>To you I give the field; pray order it</p>

<p>Fitting the persons that must use it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc>  Yes, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Come, I’ll go visit ’em. I cannot stay–</p>

<p>Their fame has fired me so–till they appear.</p>

<p>Good friend, be royal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pirithous</sc>  There shall want no bravery.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Emilia exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Poor wench, go weep, for whosoever wins</p>

<p>Loses a noble cousin for thy sins.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>
