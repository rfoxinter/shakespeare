<p><center><i>[Cornets. A battle struck within; then a retreat.</p>

<p>Flourish. Then enter, through one door, Theseus,</p>

<p>victor, accompanied by Lords and Soldiers.</p>

<p>Entering through another door, the three Queens</p>

<p>meet him, and fall on their faces before him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>To thee no star be dark!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  Both heaven and Earth</p>

<p>Friend thee forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Queen</span>  All the good that may</p>

<p>Be wished upon thy head, I cry “Amen” to ’t!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>Th’ impartial gods, who from the mounted heavens</p>

<p>View us their mortal herd, behold who err</p>

<p>And, in their time, chastise. Go and find out</p>

<p>The bones of your dead lords and honor them</p>

<p>With treble ceremony; rather than a gap</p>

<p>Should be in their dear rites, we would supply ’t;</p>

<p>But those we will depute which shall invest</p>

<p>You in your dignities and even each thing</p>

<p>Our haste does leave imperfect. So, adieu,</p>

<p>And heaven’s good eyes look on you.     <i><i>[Queens exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Herald and Soldiers bearing Palamon</p>

<p>and Arcite on biers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What are those?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Herald</span></p>

<p>Men of great quality, as may be judged</p>

<p>By their appointment. Some of Thebes have told ’s</p>

<p>They are sisters’ children, nephews to the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>By th’ helm of Mars, I saw them in the war,</p>

<p>Like to a pair of lions, smeared with prey,</p>

<p>Make lanes in troops aghast. I fixed my note</p>

<p>Constantly on them, for they were a mark</p>

<p>Worth a god’s view. What prisoner was ’t that told me</p>

<p>When I enquired their names?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Herald</span>  Wi’ leave, they’re called</p>

<p>Arcite and Palamon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  ’Tis right; those, those.</p>

<p>They are not dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Herald</span></p>

<p>Nor in a state of life. Had they been taken</p>

<p>When their last hurts were given, ’twas possible</p>

<p>They might have been recovered. Yet they breathe</p>

<p>And have the name of men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  Then like men use ’em.</p>

<p>The very lees of such, millions of rates,</p>

<p>Exceed the wine of others. All our surgeons</p>

<p>Convent in their behoof; our richest balms,</p>

<p>Rather than niggard, waste. Their lives concern us</p>

<p>Much more than Thebes is worth. Rather than have</p>

<p>’em</p>

<p>Freed of this plight, and in their morning state,</p>

<p>Sound and at liberty, I would ’em dead.</p>

<p>But forty-thousandfold we had rather have ’em</p>

<p>Prisoners to us than Death. Bear ’em speedily</p>

<p>From our kind air, to them unkind, and minister</p>

<p>What man to man may do–for our sake, more,</p>

<p>Since I have known frights, fury, friends’ behests,</p>

<p>Love’s provocations, zeal, a mistress’ task,</p>

<p>Desire of liberty, a fever, madness,</p>

<p>Hath set a mark which nature could not reach to</p>

<p>Without some imposition, sickness in will</p>

<p>O’er-wrestling strength in reason. For our love</p>

<p>And great Apollo’s mercy, all our best</p>

<p>Their best skill tender.–Lead into the city,</p>

<p>Where, having bound things scattered, we will post</p>

<p>To Athens ’fore our army.</p>
