<p>He has mistook the brake I meant, is gone</p>

<p>After his fancy. ’Tis now well-nigh morning.</p>

<p>No matter; would it were perpetual night,</p>

<p>And darkness lord o’ th’ world. Hark, ’tis a wolf!</p>

<p>In me hath grief slain fear, and but for one thing,</p>

<p>I care for nothing, and that’s Palamon.</p>

<p>I reck not if the wolves would jaw me, so</p>

<p>He had this file. What if I hallowed for him?</p>

<p>I cannot hallow. If I whooped, what then?</p>

<p>If he not answered, I should call a wolf,</p>

<p>And do him but that service. I have heard</p>

<p>Strange howls this livelong night; why may ’t not be</p>

<p>They have made prey of him? He has no weapons;</p>

<p>He cannot run; the jingling of his gyves</p>

<p>Might call fell things to listen, who have in them</p>

<p>A sense to know a man unarmed and can</p>

<p>Smell where resistance is. I’ll set it down</p>

<p>He’s torn to pieces; they howled many together,</p>

<p>And then they fed on him; so much for that.</p>

<p>Be bold to ring the bell. How stand I then?</p>

<p>All’s chared when he is gone. No, no, I lie.</p>

<p>My father’s to be hanged for his escape;</p>

<p>Myself to beg, if I prized life so much</p>

<p>As to deny my act, but that I would not,</p>

<p>Should I try death by dozens. I am moped;</p>

<p>Food took I none these two days;</p>

<p>Sipped some water. I have not closed mine eyes</p>

<p>Save when my lids scoured off their brine. Alas,</p>

<p>Dissolve, my life! Let not my sense unsettle,</p>

<p>Lest I should drown, or stab, or hang myself.</p>

<p>O state of nature, fail together in me,</p>

<p>Since thy best props are warped! So, which way now?</p>

<p>The best way is the next way to a grave;</p>

<p>Each errant step beside is torment. Lo,</p>

<p>The moon is down, the crickets chirp, the screech</p>

<p>owl</p>

<p>Calls in the dawn. All offices are done</p>

<p>Save what I fail in. But the point is this–</p>

<p>An end, and that is all.</p>
