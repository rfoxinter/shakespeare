<p><center><i>[Enter the King of England, Bedford, and Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Gloucester, ’tis true that we are in great danger.</p>

<p>The greater therefore should our courage be.–</p>

<p>Good morrow, brother Bedford. God almighty,</p>

<p>There is some soul of goodness in things evil,</p>

<p>Would men observingly distill it out.</p>

<p>For our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers,</p>

<p>Which is both healthful and good husbandry.</p>

<p>Besides, they are our outward consciences</p>

<p>And preachers to us all, admonishing</p>

<p>That we should dress us fairly for our end.</p>

<p>Thus may we gather honey from the weed</p>

<p>And make a moral of the devil himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Erpingham.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham.</p>

<p>A good soft pillow for that good white head</p>

<p>Were better than a churlish turf of France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Erpingham</sc></p>

<p>Not so, my liege, this lodging likes me better,</p>

<p>Since I may say “Now lie I like a king.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>’Tis good for men to love their present pains</p>

<p>Upon example. So the spirit is eased;</p>

<p>And when the mind is quickened, out of doubt,</p>

<p>The organs, though defunct and dead before,</p>

<p>Break up their drowsy grave and newly move</p>

<p>With casted slough and fresh legerity.</p>

<p>Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.</p>

<p><center><i>[He puts on Erpingham’s cloak.]</i></center></p>

<p>Brothers both,</p>

<p>Commend me to the princes in our camp,</p>

<p>Do my good morrow to them, and anon</p>

<p>Desire them all to my pavilion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  We shall, my liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Erpingham</sc>  Shall I attend your Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  No, my good knight.</p>

<p>Go with my brothers to my lords of England.</p>

<p>I and my bosom must debate awhile,</p>

<p>And then I would no other company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Erpingham</sc></p>

<p>The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but the King exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>God-a-mercy, old heart, thou speak’st cheerfully.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pistol.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Qui vous la?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  A friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Discuss unto me: art thou officer or art thou</p>

<p>base, common, and popular?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I am a gentleman of a company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Trail’st thou the puissant pike?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Even so. What are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  As good a gentleman as the Emperor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Then you are a better than the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  The King’s a bawcock and a heart of gold, a lad</p>

<p>of life, an imp of fame, of parents good, of fist most</p>

<p>valiant. I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heartstring I</p>

<p>love the lovely bully. What is thy name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Harry le Roy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Le Roy? A Cornish name. Art thou of Cornish</p>

<p>crew?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  No, I am a Welshman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Know’st thou Fluellen?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Tell him I’ll knock his leek about his pate upon</p>

<p>Saint Davy’s day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Do not you wear your dagger in your cap</p>

<p>that day, lest he knock that about yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Art thou his friend?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  And his kinsman too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  The figo for thee then!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I thank you. God be with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  My name is Pistol called.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  It sorts well with your fierceness.</p>

<p><center><i>[He steps aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fluellen and Gower.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Captain Fluellen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  ’So. In the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer.</p>

<p>It is the greatest admiration in the universal world</p>

<p>when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and</p>

<p>laws of the wars is not kept. If you would take the</p>

<p>pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the</p>

<p>Great, you shall find, I warrant you, that there is</p>

<p>no tiddle taddle nor pibble babble in Pompey’s</p>

<p>camp. I warrant you, you shall find the ceremonies</p>

<p>of the wars and the cares of it and the forms</p>

<p>of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to</p>

<p>be otherwise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Why, the enemy is loud. You hear him all</p>

<p>night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating</p>

<p>coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,</p>

<p>look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating</p>

<p>coxcomb, in your own conscience now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  I will speak lower.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  I pray you and beseech you that you will.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gower and Fluellen exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Though it appear a little out of fashion,</p>

<p>There is much care and valor in this Welshman.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter three Soldiers, John Bates, Alexander Court, and</p>

<p>Michael Williams.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Court</sc>  Brother John Bates, is not that the morning</p>

<p>which breaks yonder?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bates</sc>  I think it be, but we have no great cause to desire</p>

<p>the approach of day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  We see yonder the beginning of the day, but</p>

<p>I think we shall never see the end of it.–Who goes</p>

<p>there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  A friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  Under what captain serve you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  A good old commander and a most kind</p>

<p>gentleman. I pray you, what thinks he of our</p>

<p>estate?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Even as men wracked upon a sand, that</p>

<p>look to be washed off the next tide.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bates</sc>  He hath not told his thought to the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  No. Nor it is not meet he should, for,</p>

<p>though I speak it to you, I think the King is but a</p>

<p>man as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to</p>

<p>me. The element shows to him as it doth to me. All</p>

<p>his senses have but human conditions. His ceremonies</p>

<p>laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man,</p>

<p>and though his affections are higher mounted than</p>

<p>ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like</p>

<p>wing. Therefore, when he sees reason of fears as we</p>

<p>do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as</p>

<p>ours are. Yet, in reason, no man should possess him</p>

<p>with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it,</p>

<p>should dishearten his army.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bates</sc>  He may show what outward courage he will,</p>

<p>but I believe, as cold a night as ’tis, he could wish</p>

<p>himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would</p>

<p>he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were</p>

<p>quit here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  By my troth, I will speak my conscience</p>

<p>of the King. I think he would not wish himself</p>

<p>anywhere but where he is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bates</sc>  Then I would he were here alone; so should he</p>

<p>be sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men’s</p>

<p>lives saved.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I dare say you love him not so ill to wish</p>

<p>him here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel</p>

<p>other men’s minds. Methinks I could not die anywhere</p>

<p>so contented as in the King’s company, his</p>

<p>cause being just and his quarrel honorable.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  That’s more than we know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bates</sc>  Ay, or more than we should seek after, for we</p>

<p>know enough if we know we are the King’s subjects.</p>

<p>If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the</p>

<p>King wipes the crime of it out of us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  But if the cause be not good, the King</p>

<p>himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all</p>

<p>those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a</p>

<p>battle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry</p>

<p>all “We died at such a place,” some swearing, some</p>

<p>crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left</p>

<p>poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe,</p>

<p>some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard</p>

<p>there are few die well that die in a battle, for how</p>

<p>can they charitably dispose of anything when blood</p>

<p>is their argument? Now, if these men do not die</p>

<p>well, it will be a black matter for the king that led</p>

<p>them to it, who to disobey were against all proportion</p>

<p>of subjection.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  So, if a son that is by his father sent about</p>

<p>merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea,</p>

<p>the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule,</p>

<p>should be imposed upon his father that sent him.</p>

<p>Or if a servant, under his master’s command transporting</p>

<p>a sum of money, be assailed by robbers and</p>

<p>die in many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the</p>

<p>business of the master the author of the servant’s</p>

<p>damnation. But this is not so. The King is not bound</p>

<p>to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the</p>

<p>father of his son, nor the master of his servant, for</p>

<p>they purpose not their death when they purpose</p>

<p>their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause</p>

<p>never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrament of</p>

<p>swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers.</p>

<p>Some, peradventure, have on them the guilt of</p>

<p>premeditated and contrived murder; some, of beguiling</p>

<p>virgins with the broken seals of perjury;</p>

<p>some, making the wars their bulwark, that have</p>

<p>before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage</p>

<p>and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the</p>

<p>law and outrun native punishment, though they can</p>

<p>outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God.</p>

<p>War is His beadle, war is His vengeance, so that here</p>

<p>men are punished for before-breach of the King’s</p>

<p>laws in now the King’s quarrel. Where they feared</p>

<p>the death, they have borne life away; and where they</p>

<p>would be safe, they perish. Then, if they die unprovided,</p>

<p>no more is the King guilty of their damnation</p>

<p>than he was before guilty of those impieties for the</p>

<p>which they are now visited. Every subject’s duty is</p>

<p>the King’s, but every subject’s soul is his own.</p>

<p>Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as</p>

<p>every sick man in his bed: wash every mote out of</p>

<p>his conscience. And, dying so, death is to him</p>

<p>advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost</p>

<p>wherein such preparation was gained. And in him</p>

<p>that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making</p>

<p>God so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to</p>

<p>see His greatness and to teach others how they</p>

<p>should prepare.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  ’Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill</p>

<p>upon his own head; the King is not to answer it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bates</sc>  I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet</p>

<p>I determine to fight lustily for him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I myself heard the King say he would not</p>

<p>be ransomed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  Ay, he said so to make us fight cheerfully,</p>

<p>but when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed</p>

<p>and we ne’er the wiser.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  If I live to see it, I will never trust his</p>

<p>word after.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  You pay him then. That’s a perilous shot out</p>

<p>of an elder gun, that a poor and a private displeasure</p>

<p>can do against a monarch. You may as well go</p>

<p>about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face</p>

<p>with a peacock’s feather. You’ll “never trust his</p>

<p>word after.” Come, ’tis a foolish saying.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Your reproof is something too round. I</p>

<p>should be angry with you if the time were</p>

<p>convenient.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I embrace it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  How shall I know thee again?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear</p>

<p>it in my bonnet. Then, if ever thou dar’st acknowledge</p>

<p>it, I will make it my quarrel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  Here’s my glove. Give me another of thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  There.     <i><i>[They exchange gloves.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  This will I also wear in my cap. If ever thou</p>

<p>come to me and say, after tomorrow, “This is my</p>

<p>glove,” by this hand I will take thee a box on the</p>

<p>ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  Thou dar’st as well be hanged.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the</p>

<p>King’s company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  Keep thy word. Fare thee well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bates</sc>  Be friends, you English fools, be friends. We</p>

<p>have French quarrels enough, if you could tell how</p>

<p>to reckon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Indeed, the French may lay twenty</p>

<p>French crowns to one they will beat us, for they</p>

<p>bear them on their shoulders. But it is no English</p>

<p>treason to cut French crowns, and tomorrow the</p>

<p>King himself will be a clipper.</p>

<p><center><i>[Soldiers exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Upon the King! Let us our lives, our souls, our</p>

<p>debts, our careful wives, our children, and our sins,</p>

<p>lay on the King!</p>

<p>We must bear all. O hard condition,</p>

<p>Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath</p>

<p>Of every fool whose sense no more can feel</p>

<p>But his own wringing. What infinite heart’s ease</p>

<p>Must kings neglect that private men enjoy?</p>

<p>And what have kings that privates have not too,</p>

<p>Save ceremony, save general ceremony?</p>

<p>And what art thou, thou idol ceremony?</p>

<p>What kind of god art thou that suffer’st more</p>

<p>Of mortal griefs than do thy worshipers?</p>

<p>What are thy rents? What are thy comings-in?</p>

<p>O ceremony, show me but thy worth!</p>

<p>What is thy soul of adoration?</p>

<p>Art thou aught else but place, degree, and form,</p>

<p>Creating awe and fear in other men,</p>

<p>Wherein thou art less happy, being feared,</p>

<p>Than they in fearing?</p>

<p>What drink’st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,</p>

<p>But poisoned flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,</p>

<p>And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!</p>

<p>Think’st thou the fiery fever will go out</p>

<p>With titles blown from adulation?</p>

<p>Will it give place to flexure and low bending?</p>

<p>Canst thou, when thou command’st the beggar’s</p>

<p>knee,</p>

<p>Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,</p>

<p>That play’st so subtly with a king’s repose.</p>

<p>I am a king that find thee, and I know</p>

<p>’Tis not the balm, the scepter, and the ball,</p>

<p>The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,</p>

<p>The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,</p>

<p>The farced title running ’fore the King,</p>

<p>The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp</p>

<p>That beats upon the high shore of this world;</p>

<p>No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,</p>

<p>Not all these, laid in bed majestical,</p>

<p>Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave</p>

<p>Who, with a body filled and vacant mind,</p>

<p>Gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread;</p>

<p>Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,</p>

<p>But, like a lackey, from the rise to set</p>

<p>Sweats in the eye of Phoebus, and all night</p>

<p>Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn</p>

<p>Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,</p>

<p>And follows so the ever-running year</p>

<p>With profitable labor to his grave.</p>

<p>And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,</p>

<p>Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,</p>

<p>Had the forehand and vantage of a king.</p>

<p>The slave, a member of the country’s peace,</p>

<p>Enjoys it, but in gross brain little wots</p>

<p>What watch the King keeps to maintain the peace,</p>

<p>Whose hours the peasant best advantages.</p>
