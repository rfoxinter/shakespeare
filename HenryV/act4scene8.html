<p><center><i>[Enter Gower and Williams.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Williams</span>  I warrant it is to knight you, captain.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fluellen, wearing Williams’s glove.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span> <i>[to Gower]</i>  God’s will and His pleasure,</p>

<p>captain, I beseech you now, come apace to the</p>

<p>King. There is more good toward you peradventure</p>

<p>than is in your knowledge to dream of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Williams</span> <i>[to Fluellen, pointing to the glove in his own</p>

<p>hat]</i>  Sir, know you this glove?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  Know the glove? I know the glove is a glove.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Williams</span>  I know this, and thus I challenge it.</p>

<p><center><i>[Strikes him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  ’Sblood, an arrant traitor as any ’s in the</p>

<p>universal world, or in France, or in England!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gower</span> <i>[to Williams]</i>  How now, sir? You villain!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Williams</span>  Do you think I’ll be forsworn?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  Stand away, Captain Gower. I will give treason</p>

<p>his payment into plows, I warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Williams</span>  I am no traitor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  That’s a lie in thy throat.–I charge you in</p>

<p>his Majesty’s name, apprehend him. He’s a friend</p>

<p>of the Duke Alencon’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Warwick and Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span>  How now, how now, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  My Lord of Warwick, here is, praised be</p>

<p>God for it, a most contagious treason come to</p>

<p>light, look you, as you shall desire in a summer’s</p>

<p>day.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King of England and Exeter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here is his Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  How now, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that,</p>

<p>look your Grace, has struck the glove which your</p>

<p>Majesty is take out of the helmet of Alencon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Williams</span>  My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow</p>

<p>of it. And he that I gave it to in change promised to</p>

<p>wear it in his cap. I promised to strike him if he did.</p>

<p>I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I have</p>

<p>been as good as my word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  Your Majesty, hear now, saving your Majesty’s</p>

<p>manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly,</p>

<p>lousy knave it is. I hope your Majesty is pear me</p>

<p>testimony and witness and will avouchment that</p>

<p>this is the glove of Alencon that your Majesty is give</p>

<p>me, in your conscience now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[to Williams]</i>  Give me thy glove, soldier.</p>

<p>Look, here is the fellow of it.</p>

<p>’Twas I indeed thou promised’st to strike,</p>

<p>And thou hast given me most bitter terms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  An please your Majesty, let his neck answer</p>

<p>for it, if there is any martial law in the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[to Williams]</i>  How canst thou make me</p>

<p>satisfaction?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Williams</span>  All offenses, my lord, come from the heart.</p>

<p>Never came any from mine that might offend your</p>

<p>Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  It was ourself thou didst abuse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Williams</span>  Your Majesty came not like yourself. You</p>

<p>appeared to me but as a common man; witness the</p>

<p>night, your garments, your lowliness. And what</p>

<p>your Highness suffered under that shape, I beseech</p>

<p>you take it for your own fault and not mine, for, had</p>

<p>you been as I took you for, I made no offense.</p>

<p>Therefore, I beseech your Highness pardon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns</p>

<p>And give it to this fellow.–Keep it, fellow,</p>

<p>And wear it for an honor in thy cap</p>

<p>Till I do challenge it.–Give him the crowns.–</p>

<p>And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  By this day and this light, the fellow has</p>

<p>mettle enough in his belly.–Hold, there is twelvepence</p>

<p>for you, and I pray you to serve God and keep</p>

<p>you out of prawls and prabbles and quarrels and</p>

<p>dissensions, and I warrant you it is the better for</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Williams</span>  I will none of your money.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  It is with a good will. I can tell you it will</p>

<p>serve you to mend your shoes. Come, wherefore</p>

<p>should you be so pashful? Your shoes is not so</p>

<p>good. ’Tis a good silling, I warrant you, or I will</p>

<p>change it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter an English Herald.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  Now, herald, are the dead numbered?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Herald</span> <i>[giving the King a paper]</i></p>

<p>Here is the number of the slaughtered French.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[to Exeter]</i></p>

<p>What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>Charles, Duke of Orleans, nephew to the King;</p>

<p>John, Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt.</p>

<p>Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,</p>

<p>Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>This note doth tell me of ten thousand French</p>

<p>That in the field lie slain. Of princes in this number</p>

<p>And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead</p>

<p>One hundred twenty-six. Added to these,</p>

<p>Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,</p>

<p>Eight thousand and four hundred, of the which</p>

<p>Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights.</p>

<p>So that in these ten thousand they have lost,</p>

<p>There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries.</p>

<p>The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,</p>

<p>And gentlemen of blood and quality.</p>

<p>The names of those their nobles that lie dead:</p>

<p>Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France;</p>

<p>Jacques of Chatillon, Admiral of France;</p>

<p>The Master of the Crossbows, Lord Rambures;</p>

<p>Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard</p>

<p>Dauphin;</p>

<p>John, Duke of Alencon; Anthony, Duke of Brabant,</p>

<p>The brother to the Duke of Burgundy;</p>

<p>And Edward, Duke of Bar. Of lusty earls:</p>

<p>Grandpre and Roussi, Faulconbridge and Foix,</p>

<p>Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.</p>

<p>Here was a royal fellowship of death.</p>

<p>Where is the number of our English dead?</p>

<p><center><i>[Herald gives him another paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,</p>

<p>Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire;</p>

<p>None else of name, and of all other men</p>

<p>But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here,</p>

<p>And not to us, but to thy arm alone</p>

<p>Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,</p>

<p>But in plain shock and even play of battle,</p>

<p>Was ever known so great and little loss</p>

<p>On one part and on th’ other? Take it, God,</p>

<p>For it is none but thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span>  ’Tis wonderful.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Come, go we in procession to the village,</p>

<p>And be it death proclaimed through our host</p>

<p>To boast of this or take that praise from God</p>

<p>Which is His only.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  Is it not lawful, an please your Majesty, to</p>

<p>tell how many is killed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Yes, captain, but with this acknowledgment:</p>

<p>That God fought for us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  Yes, my conscience, He did us great good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  Do we all holy rites.</p>

<p>Let there be sung Non nobis, and Te Deum,</p>

<p>The dead with charity enclosed in clay,</p>

<p>And then to Calais, and to England then,</p>

<p>Where ne’er from France arrived more happy men.</p>
