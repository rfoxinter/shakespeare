<p><center><i>[Enter Exeter, Bedford, and Westmoreland.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc></p>

<p>’Fore God, his Grace is bold to trust these traitors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>They shall be apprehended by and by.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Westmoreland</sc></p>

<p>How smooth and even they do bear themselves,</p>

<p>As if allegiance in their bosoms sat</p>

<p>Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc></p>

<p>The King hath note of all that they intend,</p>

<p>By interception which they dream not of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,</p>

<p>Whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious</p>

<p>favors–</p>

<p>That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell</p>

<p>His sovereign’s life to death and treachery!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Sound Trumpets. Enter the King of England,</p>

<p>Scroop, Cambridge, and Grey, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.–</p>

<p>My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of</p>

<p>Masham,</p>

<p>And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.</p>

<p>Think you not that the powers we bear with us</p>

<p>Will cut their passage through the force of France,</p>

<p>Doing the execution and the act</p>

<p>For which we have in head assembled them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Scroop</sc></p>

<p>No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>I doubt not that, since we are well persuaded</p>

<p>We carry not a heart with us from hence</p>

<p>That grows not in a fair consent with ours,</p>

<p>Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish</p>

<p>Success and conquest to attend on us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cambridge</sc></p>

<p>Never was monarch better feared and loved</p>

<p>Than is your Majesty. There’s not, I think, a subject</p>

<p>That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness</p>

<p>Under the sweet shade of your government.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grey</sc></p>

<p>True. Those that were your father’s enemies</p>

<p>Have steeped their galls in honey, and do serve you</p>

<p>With hearts create of duty and of zeal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>We therefore have great cause of thankfulness,</p>

<p>And shall forget the office of our hand</p>

<p>Sooner than quittance of desert and merit</p>

<p>According to the weight and worthiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Scroop</sc></p>

<p>So service shall with steeled sinews toil,</p>

<p>And labor shall refresh itself with hope</p>

<p>To do your Grace incessant services.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>We judge no less.–Uncle of Exeter,</p>

<p>Enlarge the man committed yesterday</p>

<p>That railed against our person. We consider</p>

<p>It was excess of wine that set him on,</p>

<p>And on his more advice we pardon him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Scroop</sc></p>

<p>That’s mercy, but too much security.</p>

<p>Let him be punished, sovereign, lest example</p>

<p>Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  O, let us yet be merciful.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cambridge</sc></p>

<p>So may your Highness, and yet punish too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grey</sc></p>

<p>Sir, you show great mercy if you give him life</p>

<p>After the taste of much correction.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Alas, your too much love and care of me</p>

<p>Are heavy orisons ’gainst this poor wretch.</p>

<p>If little faults proceeding on distemper</p>

<p>Shall not be winked at, how shall we stretch our eye</p>

<p>When capital crimes, chewed, swallowed, and</p>

<p>digested,</p>

<p>Appear before us? We’ll yet enlarge that man,</p>

<p>Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear</p>

<p>care</p>

<p>And tender preservation of our person,</p>

<p>Would have him punished. And now to our French</p>

<p>causes.</p>

<p>Who are the late commissioners?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cambridge</sc>  I one, my lord.</p>

<p>Your Highness bade me ask for it today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Scroop</sc>  So did you me, my liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grey</sc>  And I, my royal sovereign.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc> <i>[giving them papers]</i></p>

<p>Then Richard, Earl of Cambridge, there is yours–</p>

<p>There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham.–And, sir</p>

<p>knight,</p>

<p>Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours.–</p>

<p>Read them, and know I know your worthiness.–</p>

<p>My Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter,</p>

<p>We will aboard tonight.–Why how now, gentlemen?</p>

<p>What see you in those papers, that you lose</p>

<p>So much complexion?–Look you, how they change.</p>

<p>Their cheeks are paper.–Why, what read you there</p>

<p>That have so cowarded and chased your blood</p>

<p>Out of appearance?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cambridge</sc>  I do confess my fault,</p>

<p>And do submit me to your Highness’ mercy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grey</sc>/<sc>Scroop</sc>  To which we all appeal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>The mercy that was quick in us but late</p>

<p>By your own counsel is suppressed and killed.</p>

<p>You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy,</p>

<p>For your own reasons turn into your bosoms</p>

<p>As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.–</p>

<p>See you, my princes and my noble peers,</p>

<p>These English monsters. My Lord of Cambridge</p>

<p>here,</p>

<p>You know how apt our love was to accord</p>

<p>To furnish him with all appurtenants</p>

<p>Belonging to his honor, and this man</p>

<p>Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired</p>

<p>And sworn unto the practices of France</p>

<p>To kill us here in Hampton; to the which</p>

<p>This knight, no less for bounty bound to us</p>

<p>Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn.–But O,</p>

<p>What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop, thou cruel,</p>

<p>Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature?</p>

<p>Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,</p>

<p>That knew’st the very bottom of my soul,</p>

<p>That almost mightst have coined me into gold,</p>

<p>Wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use–</p>

<p>May it be possible that foreign hire</p>

<p>Could out of thee extract one spark of evil</p>

<p>That might annoy my finger? ’Tis so strange</p>

<p>That, though the truth of it stands off as gross</p>

<p>As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.</p>

<p>Treason and murder ever kept together,</p>

<p>As two yoke-devils sworn to either’s purpose,</p>

<p>Working so grossly in a natural cause</p>

<p>That admiration did not whoop at them.</p>

<p>But thou, ’gainst all proportion, didst bring in</p>

<p>Wonder to wait on treason and on murder,</p>

<p>And whatsoever cunning fiend it was</p>

<p>That wrought upon thee so preposterously</p>

<p>Hath got the voice in hell for excellence.</p>

<p>All other devils that suggest by treasons</p>

<p>Do botch and bungle up damnation</p>

<p>With patches, colors, and with forms being fetched</p>

<p>From glist’ring semblances of piety;</p>

<p>But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up,</p>

<p>Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,</p>

<p>Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.</p>

<p>If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus</p>

<p>Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,</p>

<p>He might return to vasty Tartar back</p>

<p>And tell the legions “I can never win</p>

<p>A soul so easy as that Englishman’s.”</p>

<p>O, how hast thou with jealousy infected</p>

<p>The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?</p>

<p>Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learned?</p>

<p>Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?</p>

<p>Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?</p>

<p>Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,</p>

<p>Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,</p>

<p>Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,</p>

<p>Garnished and decked in modest complement,</p>

<p>Not working with the eye without the ear,</p>

<p>And but in purged judgment trusting neither?</p>

<p>Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.</p>

<p>And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot</p>

<p>To mark the full-fraught man and best endued</p>

<p>With some suspicion. I will weep for thee,</p>

<p>For this revolt of thine methinks is like</p>

<p>Another fall of man.–Their faults are open.</p>

<p>Arrest them to the answer of the law,</p>

<p>And God acquit them of their practices.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc>  I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of</p>

<p>Richard, Earl of Cambridge.–</p>

<p>I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of</p>

<p>Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham.–</p>

<p>I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of</p>

<p>Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Scroop</sc></p>

<p>Our purposes God justly hath discovered,</p>

<p>And I repent my fault more than my death,</p>

<p>Which I beseech your Highness to forgive,</p>

<p>Although my body pay the price of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cambridge</sc></p>

<p>For me, the gold of France did not seduce,</p>

<p>Although I did admit it as a motive</p>

<p>The sooner to effect what I intended;</p>

<p>But God be thanked for prevention,</p>

<p>Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,</p>

<p>Beseeching God and you to pardon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grey</sc></p>

<p>Never did faithful subject more rejoice</p>

<p>At the discovery of most dangerous treason</p>

<p>Than I do at this hour joy o’er myself,</p>

<p>Prevented from a damned enterprise.</p>

<p>My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>God quit you in His mercy. Hear your sentence:</p>

<p>You have conspired against our royal person,</p>

<p>Joined with an enemy proclaimed, and from his</p>

<p>coffers</p>

<p>Received the golden earnest of our death,</p>

<p>Wherein you would have sold your king to</p>

<p>slaughter,</p>

<p>His princes and his peers to servitude,</p>

<p>His subjects to oppression and contempt,</p>

<p>And his whole kingdom into desolation.</p>

<p>Touching our person, seek we no revenge,</p>

<p>But we our kingdom’s safety must so tender,</p>

<p>Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws</p>

<p>We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,</p>

<p>Poor miserable wretches, to your death,</p>

<p>The taste whereof God of His mercy give</p>

<p>You patience to endure, and true repentance</p>

<p>Of all your dear offenses.–Bear them hence.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit under guard.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now, lords, for France, the enterprise whereof</p>

<p>Shall be to you as us, like glorious.</p>

<p>We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,</p>

<p>Since God so graciously hath brought to light</p>

<p>This dangerous treason lurking in our way</p>

<p>To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now</p>

<p>But every rub is smoothed on our way.</p>

<p>Then forth, dear countrymen. Let us deliver</p>

<p>Our puissance into the hand of God,</p>

<p>Putting it straight in expedition.</p>

<p>Cheerly to sea. The signs of war advance.</p>

<p>No king of England if not king of France.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. They exit.]</i></center></p>
