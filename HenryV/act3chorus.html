<p><span class='sc'>Chorus</span></p>

<p>Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies</p>

<p>In motion of no less celerity</p>

<p>Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen</p>

<p>The well-appointed king at Dover pier</p>

<p>Embark his royalty, and his brave fleet</p>

<p>With silken streamers the young Phoebus</p>

<p>fanning.</p>

<p>Play with your fancies and in them behold,</p>

<p>Upon the hempen tackle, shipboys climbing.</p>

<p>Hear the shrill whistle, which doth order give</p>

<p>To sounds confused. Behold the threaden sails,</p>

<p>Borne with th’ invisible and creeping wind,</p>

<p>Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea,</p>

<p>Breasting the lofty surge. O, do but think</p>

<p>You stand upon the rivage and behold</p>

<p>A city on th’ inconstant billows dancing,</p>

<p>For so appears this fleet majestical,</p>

<p>Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow!</p>

<p>Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,</p>

<p>And leave your England, as dead midnight still,</p>

<p>Guarded with grandsires, babies, and old women,</p>

<p>Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance,</p>

<p>For who is he whose chin is but enriched</p>

<p>With one appearing hair that will not follow</p>

<p>These culled and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?</p>

<p>Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;</p>

<p>Behold the ordnance on their carriages,</p>

<p>With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.</p>

<p>Suppose th’ Ambassador from the French comes</p>

<p>back,</p>

<p>Tells Harry that the King doth offer him</p>

<p>Katherine his daughter and with her, to dowry,</p>

<p>Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.</p>

<p>The offer likes not, and the nimble gunner</p>

<p>With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,</p>

<p><center><i>[Alarum, and chambers go off.]</i></center></p>

<p>And down goes all before them. Still be kind,</p>

<p>And eke out our performance with your mind.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
