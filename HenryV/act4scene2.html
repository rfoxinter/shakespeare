<p><center><i>[Enter the Dauphin, Orleans, Rambures, and Beaumont.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orleans</sc></p>

<p>The sun doth gild our armor. Up, my lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Montez a cheval! My horse, varlet! Lackey! Ha!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orleans</sc>  O brave spirit!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc>  Via les eaux et terre.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orleans</sc>  Rien puis? L’air et feu?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc>  Cieux, cousin Orleans.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Constable.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now, my Lord Constable?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constable</sc></p>

<p>Hark how our steeds for present service neigh.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Mount them, and make incision in their hides,</p>

<p>That their hot blood may spin in English eyes</p>

<p>And dout them with superfluous courage. Ha!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rambures</sc></p>

<p>What, will you have them weep our horses’ blood?</p>

<p>How shall we then behold their natural tears?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>The English are embattled, you French peers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constable</sc></p>

<p>To horse, you gallant princes, straight to horse.</p>

<p>Do but behold yond poor and starved band,</p>

<p>And your fair show shall suck away their souls,</p>

<p>Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.</p>

<p>There is not work enough for all our hands,</p>

<p>Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins</p>

<p>To give each naked curtal ax a stain,</p>

<p>That our French gallants shall today draw out</p>

<p>And sheathe for lack of sport. Let us but blow on</p>

<p>them,</p>

<p>The vapor of our valor will o’erturn them.</p>

<p>’Tis positive against all exceptions, lords,</p>

<p>That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,</p>

<p>Who in unnecessary action swarm</p>

<p>About our squares of battle, were enough</p>

<p>To purge this field of such a hilding foe,</p>

<p>Though we upon this mountain’s basis by</p>

<p>Took stand for idle speculation,</p>

<p>But that our honors must not. What’s to say?</p>

<p>A very little little let us do,</p>

<p>And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound</p>

<p>The tucket sonance and the note to mount,</p>

<p>For our approach shall so much dare the field</p>

<p>That England shall couch down in fear and yield.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Grandpre.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grandpre</sc></p>

<p>Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?</p>

<p>Yond island carrions, desperate of their bones,</p>

<p>Ill-favoredly become the morning field.</p>

<p>Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,</p>

<p>And our air shakes them passing scornfully.</p>

<p>Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host</p>

<p>And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps.</p>

<p>The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks</p>

<p>With torch staves in their hand, and their poor jades</p>

<p>Lob down their heads, drooping the hides and hips,</p>

<p>The gum down-roping from their pale dead eyes,</p>

<p>And in their pale dull mouths the gemeled bit</p>

<p>Lies foul with chawed grass, still and motionless.</p>

<p>And their executors, the knavish crows,</p>

<p>Fly o’er them all, impatient for their hour.</p>

<p>Description cannot suit itself in words</p>

<p>To demonstrate the life of such a battle</p>

<p>In life so lifeless, as it shows itself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constable</sc></p>

<p>They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits,</p>

<p>And give their fasting horses provender,</p>

<p>And after fight with them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constable</sc></p>

<p>I stay but for my guard. On, to the field!</p>

<p>I will the banner from a trumpet take</p>

<p>And use it for my haste. Come, come away.</p>

<p>The sun is high, and we outwear the day.</p>
