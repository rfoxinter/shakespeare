<p><center><i>[Enter Captains, English and Welsh, Gower and Fluellen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gower</span>  How now, Captain Fluellen? Come you from</p>

<p>the bridge?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  I assure you there is very excellent services</p>

<p>committed at the bridge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gower</span>  Is the Duke of Exeter safe?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as</p>

<p>Agamemnon, and a man that I love and honor with</p>

<p>my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and</p>

<p>my living and my uttermost power. He is not, God</p>

<p>be praised and blessed, any hurt in the world, but</p>

<p>keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent</p>

<p>discipline. There is an aunchient lieutenant there at</p>

<p>the pridge; I think in my very conscience he is as</p>

<p>valiant a man as Mark Antony, and he is a man of no</p>

<p>estimation in the world, but I did see him do as</p>

<p>gallant service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gower</span>  What do you call him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  He is called Aunchient Pistol.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gower</span>  I know him not.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pistol.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  Here is the man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Captain, I thee beseech to do me favors. The</p>

<p>Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  Ay, I praise God, and I have merited some</p>

<p>love at his hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart and</p>

<p>of buxom valor, hath, by cruel Fate and giddy</p>

<p>Fortune’s furious fickle wheel, that goddess blind,</p>

<p>that stands upon the rolling restless stone–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  By your patience, Aunchient Pistol, Fortune</p>

<p>is painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to</p>

<p>signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is</p>

<p>painted also with a wheel to signify to you, which is</p>

<p>the moral of it, that she is turning and inconstant,</p>

<p>and mutability and variation; and her foot, look you,</p>

<p>is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls and rolls</p>

<p>and rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most</p>

<p>excellent description of it. Fortune is an excellent</p>

<p>moral.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Fortune is Bardolph’s foe and frowns on him,</p>

<p>for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must he be. A</p>

<p>damned death! Let gallows gape for dog, let man go</p>

<p>free, and let not hemp his windpipe suffocate. But</p>

<p>Exeter hath given the doom of death for pax of little</p>

<p>price. Therefore go speak; the Duke will hear thy</p>

<p>voice, and let not Bardolph’s vital thread be cut</p>

<p>with edge of penny cord and vile reproach. Speak,</p>

<p>captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand</p>

<p>your meaning.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Why then, rejoice therefore.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to</p>

<p>rejoice at, for if, look you, he were my brother, I</p>

<p>would desire the Duke to use his good pleasure and</p>

<p>put him to execution, for discipline ought to be</p>

<p>used.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Die and be damned, and figo for thy friendship!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  It is well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  The fig of Spain!     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  Very good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gower</span>  Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal. I</p>

<p>remember him now, a bawd, a cutpurse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  I’ll assure you he uttered as prave words at</p>

<p>the pridge as you shall see in a summer’s day. But it</p>

<p>is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well, I</p>

<p>warrant you, when time is serve.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gower</span>  Why, ’tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and</p>

<p>then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return</p>

<p>into London under the form of a soldier; and such</p>

<p>fellows are perfect in the great commanders’</p>

<p>names, and they will learn you by rote where</p>

<p>services were done–at such and such a sconce, at</p>

<p>such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off</p>

<p>bravely, who was shot, who disgraced, what terms</p>

<p>the enemy stood on; and this they con perfectly in</p>

<p>the phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tuned</p>

<p>oaths; and what a beard of the general’s cut</p>

<p>and a horrid suit of the camp will do among</p>

<p>foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to</p>

<p>be thought on. But you must learn to know such</p>

<p>slanders of the age, or else you may be marvelously</p>

<p>mistook.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  I tell you what, Captain Gower. I do perceive</p>

<p>he is not the man that he would gladly make</p>

<p>show to the world he is. If I find a hole in his coat, I</p>

<p>will tell him my mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Drum and Colors. Enter the King of England and his</p>

<p>poor Soldiers, and Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Hark you, the King is coming, and I must speak</p>

<p>with him from the pridge.–God pless your</p>

<p>Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  How now, Fluellen, cam’st thou from the</p>

<p>bridge?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  Ay, so please your Majesty. The Duke of</p>

<p>Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge.</p>

<p>The French is gone off, look you, and there is gallant</p>

<p>and most prave passages. Marry, th’ athversary was</p>

<p>have possession of the pridge, but he is enforced</p>

<p>to retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the</p>

<p>pridge. I can tell your Majesty, the Duke is a prave</p>

<p>man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  What men have you lost, Fluellen?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fluellen</span>  The perdition of th’ athversary hath been</p>

<p>very great, reasonable great. Marry, for my part, I</p>

<p>think the Duke hath lost never a man but one that is</p>

<p>like to be executed for robbing a church, one</p>

<p>Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man. His face is</p>

<p>all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o’</p>

<p>fire; and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a</p>

<p>coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red, but</p>

<p>his nose is executed, and his fire’s out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  We would have all such offenders so cut</p>

<p>off; and we give express charge that in our marches</p>

<p>through the country there be nothing compelled</p>

<p>from the villages, nothing taken but paid for,</p>

<p>none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful</p>

<p>language; for when lenity and cruelty play</p>

<p>for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest</p>

<p>winner.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Tucket. Enter Montjoy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montjoy</span>  You know me by my habit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  Well then, I know thee. What shall I know</p>

<p>of thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montjoy</span>  My master’s mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  Unfold it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montjoy</span>  Thus says my king: “Say thou to Harry of</p>

<p>England, though we seemed dead, we did but sleep.</p>

<p>Advantage is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him</p>

<p>we could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we</p>

<p>thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full</p>

<p>ripe. Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is</p>

<p>imperial. England shall repent his folly, see his</p>

<p>weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him</p>

<p>therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion</p>

<p>the losses we have borne, the subjects we</p>

<p>have lost, the disgrace we have digested, which, in</p>

<p>weight to reanswer, his pettiness would bow under.</p>

<p>For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th’</p>

<p>effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom</p>

<p>too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own</p>

<p>person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless</p>

<p>satisfaction. To this, add defiance, and tell him,</p>

<p>for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers,</p>

<p>whose condemnation is pronounced.” So far my</p>

<p>king and master; so much my office.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>What is thy name? I know thy quality.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montjoy</span>  Montjoy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back,</p>

<p>And tell thy king I do not seek him now</p>

<p>But could be willing to march on to Calais</p>

<p>Without impeachment, for, to say the sooth,</p>

<p>Though ’tis no wisdom to confess so much</p>

<p>Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,</p>

<p>My people are with sickness much enfeebled,</p>

<p>My numbers lessened, and those few I have</p>

<p>Almost no better than so many French,</p>

<p>Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,</p>

<p>I thought upon one pair of English legs</p>

<p>Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgive me, God,</p>

<p>That I do brag thus. This your air of France</p>

<p>Hath blown that vice in me. I must repent.</p>

<p>Go therefore, tell thy master: here I am.</p>

<p>My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,</p>

<p>My army but a weak and sickly guard,</p>

<p>Yet, God before, tell him we will come on</p>

<p>Though France himself and such another neighbor</p>

<p>Stand in our way. There’s for thy labor, Montjoy.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gives money.]</i></center></p>

<p>Go bid thy master well advise himself:</p>

<p>If we may pass, we will; if we be hindered,</p>

<p>We shall your tawny ground with your red blood</p>

<p>Discolor. And so, Montjoy, fare you well.</p>

<p>The sum of all our answer is but this:</p>

<p>We would not seek a battle as we are,</p>

<p>Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it.</p>

<p>So tell your master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montjoy</span></p>

<p>I shall deliver so. Thanks to your Highness.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>I hope they will not come upon us now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>We are in God’s hand, brother, not in theirs.</p>

<p>March to the bridge. It now draws toward night.</p>

<p>Beyond the river we’ll encamp ourselves,</p>

<p>And on tomorrow bid them march away.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
