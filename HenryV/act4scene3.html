<p><center><i>[Enter Gloucester, Bedford, Exeter, Erpingham with all</p>

<p>his host, Salisbury, and Westmoreland.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Where is the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc></p>

<p>The King himself is rode to view their battle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Westmoreland</sc></p>

<p>Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>There’s five to one. Besides, they all are fresh.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>God’s arm strike with us! ’Tis a fearful odds.</p>

<p>God be wi’ you, princes all. I’ll to my charge.</p>

<p>If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,</p>

<p>Then joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,</p>

<p>My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,</p>

<p>And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<p>And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,</p>

<p>For thou art framed of the firm truth of valor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, kind lord. Fight valiantly today.</p>

<p><center><i>[Salisbury exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc></p>

<p>He is as full of valor as of kindness,</p>

<p>Princely in both.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the King of England.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Westmoreland</sc>  O, that we now had here</p>

<p>But one ten thousand of those men in England</p>

<p>That do no work today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  What’s he that wishes so?</p>

<p>My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin.</p>

<p>If we are marked to die, we are enough</p>

<p>To do our country loss; and if to live,</p>

<p>The fewer men, the greater share of honor.</p>

<p>God’s will, I pray thee wish not one man more.</p>

<p>By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,</p>

<p>Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;</p>

<p>It yearns me not if men my garments wear;</p>

<p>Such outward things dwell not in my desires.</p>

<p>But if it be a sin to covet honor,</p>

<p>I am the most offending soul alive.</p>

<p>No, ’faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.</p>

<p>God’s peace, I would not lose so great an honor</p>

<p>As one man more, methinks, would share from me,</p>

<p>For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!</p>

<p>Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,</p>

<p>That he which hath no stomach to this fight,</p>

<p>Let him depart. His passport shall be made,</p>

<p>And crowns for convoy put into his purse.</p>

<p>We would not die in that man’s company</p>

<p>That fears his fellowship to die with us.</p>

<p>This day is called the feast of Crispian.</p>

<p>He that outlives this day and comes safe home</p>

<p>Will stand o’ tiptoe when this day is named</p>

<p>And rouse him at the name of Crispian.</p>

<p>He that shall see this day, and live old age,</p>

<p>Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors</p>

<p>And say “Tomorrow is Saint Crispian.”</p>

<p>Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.</p>

<p>Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,</p>

<p>But he’ll remember with advantages</p>

<p>What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,</p>

<p>Familiar in his mouth as household words,</p>

<p>Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,</p>

<p>Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,</p>

<p>Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.</p>

<p>This story shall the good man teach his son,</p>

<p>And Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by,</p>

<p>From this day to the ending of the world,</p>

<p>But we in it shall be remembered–</p>

<p>We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;</p>

<p>For he today that sheds his blood with me</p>

<p>Shall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile,</p>

<p>This day shall gentle his condition;</p>

<p>And gentlemen in England now abed</p>

<p>Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,</p>

<p>And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks</p>

<p>That fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Salisbury.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed.</p>

<p>The French are bravely in their battles set,</p>

<p>And will with all expedience charge on us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>All things are ready if our minds be so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Westmoreland</sc></p>

<p>Perish the man whose mind is backward now!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Westmoreland</sc></p>

<p>God’s will, my liege, would you and I alone,</p>

<p>Without more help, could fight this royal battle!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Why, now thou hast unwished five thousand men,</p>

<p>Which likes me better than to wish us one.–</p>

<p>You know your places. God be with you all.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Tucket. Enter Montjoy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montjoy</sc></p>

<p>Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry,</p>

<p>If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,</p>

<p>Before thy most assured overthrow.</p>

<p>For certainly thou art so near the gulf</p>

<p>Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy,</p>

<p>The Constable desires thee thou wilt mind</p>

<p>Thy followers of repentance, that their souls</p>

<p>May make a peaceful and a sweet retire</p>

<p>From off these fields where, wretches, their poor</p>

<p>bodies</p>

<p>Must lie and fester.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Who hath sent thee now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montjoy</sc>  The Constable of France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>I pray thee bear my former answer back.</p>

<p>Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.</p>

<p>Good God, why should they mock poor fellows</p>

<p>thus?</p>

<p>The man that once did sell the lion’s skin</p>

<p>While the beast lived was killed with hunting him.</p>

<p>A many of our bodies shall no doubt</p>

<p>Find native graves, upon the which, I trust,</p>

<p>Shall witness live in brass of this day’s work.</p>

<p>And those that leave their valiant bones in France,</p>

<p>Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,</p>

<p>They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet</p>

<p>them</p>

<p>And draw their honors reeking up to heaven,</p>

<p>Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,</p>

<p>The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.</p>

<p>Mark, then, abounding valor in our English,</p>

<p>That being dead, like to the bullet’s crazing,</p>

<p>Break out into a second course of mischief,</p>

<p>Killing in relapse of mortality.</p>

<p>Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable</p>

<p>We are but warriors for the working day;</p>

<p>Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched</p>

<p>With rainy marching in the painful field.</p>

<p>There’s not a piece of feather in our host–</p>

<p>Good argument, I hope, we will not fly–</p>

<p>And time hath worn us into slovenry.</p>

<p>But, by the Mass, our hearts are in the trim,</p>

<p>And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night</p>

<p>They’ll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck</p>

<p>The gay new coats o’er the French soldiers’ heads</p>

<p>And turn them out of service. If they do this,</p>

<p>As, if God please, they shall, my ransom then</p>

<p>Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labor.</p>

<p>Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald.</p>

<p>They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints,</p>

<p>Which, if they have, as I will leave ’em them,</p>

<p>Shall yield them little, tell the Constable.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montjoy</sc></p>

<p>I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well.</p>

<p>Thou never shalt hear herald anymore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I fear thou wilt once more come again</p>

<p>for a ransom.     <i><i>[Montjoy exits.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[Enter York.</p>

<p>]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg</p>

<p>The leading of the vaward.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Take it, brave York.     <i><i>[York rises.]</i></i></p>

<p>Now, soldiers, march away,</p>

<p>And how Thou pleasest, God, dispose the day.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
