<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter the French King, the Dauphin, the Dukes</p>

<p> of Berri and Brittany, the Constable, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>Thus comes the English with full power upon us,</p>

<p>And more than carefully it us concerns</p>

<p>To answer royally in our defenses.</p>

<p>Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Brittany,</p>

<p>Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,</p>

<p>And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,</p>

<p>To line and new-repair our towns of war</p>

<p>With men of courage and with means defendant.</p>

<p>For England his approaches makes as fierce</p>

<p>As waters to the sucking of a gulf.</p>

<p>It fits us then to be as provident</p>

<p>As fear may teach us out of late examples</p>

<p>Left by the fatal and neglected English</p>

<p>Upon our fields.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc>  My most redoubted father,</p>

<p>It is most meet we arm us ’gainst the foe,</p>

<p>For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,</p>

<p>Though war nor no known quarrel were in question</p>

<p>But that defenses, musters, preparations</p>

<p>Should be maintained, assembled, and collected</p>

<p>As were a war in expectation.</p>

<p>Therefore I say ’tis meet we all go forth</p>

<p>To view the sick and feeble parts of France.</p>

<p>And let us do it with no show of fear,</p>

<p>No, with no more than if we heard that England</p>

<p>Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance.</p>

<p>For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged,</p>

<p>Her scepter so fantastically borne</p>

<p>By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,</p>

<p>That fear attends her not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constable</sc>  O peace, Prince Dauphin!</p>

<p>You are too much mistaken in this king.</p>

<p>Question your Grace the late ambassadors</p>

<p>With what great state he heard their embassy,</p>

<p>How well supplied with noble councillors,</p>

<p>How modest in exception, and withal</p>

<p>How terrible in constant resolution,</p>

<p>And you shall find his vanities forespent</p>

<p>Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,</p>

<p>Covering discretion with a coat of folly,</p>

<p>As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots</p>

<p>That shall first spring and be most delicate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Well, ’tis not so, my Lord High Constable.</p>

<p>But though we think it so, it is no matter.</p>

<p>In cases of defense, ’tis best to weigh</p>

<p>The enemy more mighty than he seems.</p>

<p>So the proportions of defense are filled,</p>

<p>Which of a weak and niggardly projection</p>

<p>Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting</p>

<p>A little cloth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc>  Think we King Harry strong,</p>

<p>And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.</p>

<p>The kindred of him hath been fleshed upon us,</p>

<p>And he is bred out of that bloody strain</p>

<p>That haunted us in our familiar paths.</p>

<p>Witness our too-much-memorable shame</p>

<p>When Cressy battle fatally was struck</p>

<p>And all our princes captived by the hand</p>

<p>Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of</p>

<p>Wales,</p>

<p>Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing</p>

<p>Up in the air, crowned with the golden sun,</p>

<p>Saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him</p>

<p>Mangle the work of nature and deface</p>

<p>The patterns that by God and by French fathers</p>

<p>Had twenty years been made. This is a stem</p>

<p>Of that victorious stock, and let us fear</p>

<p>The native mightiness and fate of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Ambassadors from Harry King of England</p>

<p>Do crave admittance to your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>We’ll give them present audience. Go, and bring</p>

<p>them.     <i><i>[Messenger exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>You see this chase is hotly followed, friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Turn head and stop pursuit, for coward dogs</p>

<p>Most spend their mouths when what they seem to</p>

<p>threaten</p>

<p>Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,</p>

<p>Take up the English short, and let them know</p>

<p>Of what a monarchy you are the head.</p>

<p>Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin</p>

<p>As self-neglecting.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Exeter, with Lords and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc>  From our brother of England?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>From him, and thus he greets your Majesty:</p>

<p>He wills you, in the name of God almighty,</p>

<p>That you divest yourself and lay apart</p>

<p>The borrowed glories that, by gift of heaven,</p>

<p>By law of nature and of nations, ’longs</p>

<p>To him and to his heirs–namely, the crown</p>

<p>And all wide-stretched honors that pertain</p>

<p>By custom and the ordinance of times</p>

<p>Unto the crown of France. That you may know</p>

<p>’Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim</p>

<p>Picked from the wormholes of long-vanished days</p>

<p>Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,</p>

<p>He sends you this most memorable line,</p>

<p><center><i>[He offers a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>In every branch truly demonstrative,</p>

<p>Willing you overlook this pedigree,</p>

<p>And when you find him evenly derived</p>

<p>From his most famed of famous ancestors,</p>

<p>Edward the Third, he bids you then resign</p>

<p>Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held</p>

<p>From him, the native and true challenger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc>  Or else what follows?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>Bloody constraint, for if you hide the crown</p>

<p>Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.</p>

<p>Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,</p>

<p>In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove,</p>

<p>That, if requiring fail, he will compel,</p>

<p>And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,</p>

<p>Deliver up the crown and to take mercy</p>

<p>On the poor souls for whom this hungry war</p>

<p>Opens his vasty jaws, and on your head</p>

<p>Turning the widows’ tears, the orphans’ cries,</p>

<p>The dead men’s blood, the prived maidens’</p>

<p>groans,</p>

<p>For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers</p>

<p>That shall be swallowed in this controversy.</p>

<p>This is his claim, his threat’ning, and my message–</p>

<p>Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,</p>

<p>To whom expressly I bring greeting too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>For us, we will consider of this further.</p>

<p>Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent</p>

<p>Back to our brother of England.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc> <i>[to Exeter]</i>  For the Dauphin,</p>

<p>I stand here for him. What to him from England?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt,</p>

<p>And anything that may not misbecome</p>

<p>The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.</p>

<p>Thus says my king: an if your father’s Highness</p>

<p>Do not, in grant of all demands at large,</p>

<p>Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty,</p>

<p>He’ll call you to so hot an answer of it</p>

<p>That caves and womby vaultages of France</p>

<p>Shall chide your trespass and return your mock</p>

<p>In second accent of his ordinance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Say, if my father render fair return,</p>

<p>It is against my will, for I desire</p>

<p>Nothing but odds with England. To that end,</p>

<p>As matching to his youth and vanity,</p>

<p>I did present him with the Paris balls.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>He’ll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,</p>

<p>Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe.</p>

<p>And be assured you’ll find a difference,</p>

<p>As we his subjects have in wonder found,</p>

<p>Between the promise of his greener days</p>

<p>And these he masters now. Now he weighs time</p>

<p>Even to the utmost grain. That you shall read</p>

<p>In your own losses, if he stay in France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king</p>

<p>Come here himself to question our delay,</p>

<p>For he is footed in this land already.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>You shall be soon dispatched with fair conditions.</p>

<p>A night is but small breath and little pause</p>

<p>To answer matters of this consequence.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. They exit.]</i></center></p>
