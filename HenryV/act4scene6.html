<p><center><i>[Alarum. Enter the King of England and his train,</p>

<p>with prisoners.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Well have we done, thrice-valiant countrymen,</p>

<p>But all’s not done. Yet keep the French the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Exeter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>The Duke of York commends him to your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Lives he, good uncle? Thrice within this hour</p>

<p>I saw him down, thrice up again and fighting.</p>

<p>From helmet to the spur, all blood he was.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,</p>

<p>Larding the plain, and by his bloody side,</p>

<p>Yoke-fellow to his honor-owing wounds,</p>

<p>The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.</p>

<p>Suffolk first died, and York, all haggled over,</p>

<p>Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped,</p>

<p>And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes</p>

<p>That bloodily did yawn upon his face.</p>

<p>He cries aloud “Tarry, my cousin Suffolk.</p>

<p>My soul shall thine keep company to heaven.</p>

<p>Tarry, sweet soul, for mine; then fly abreast,</p>

<p>As in this glorious and well-foughten field</p>

<p>We kept together in our chivalry.”</p>

<p>Upon these words I came and cheered him up.</p>

<p>He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,</p>

<p>And with a feeble grip, says “Dear my lord,</p>

<p>Commend my service to my sovereign.”</p>

<p>So did he turn, and over Suffolk’s neck</p>

<p>He threw his wounded arm and kissed his lips,</p>

<p>And so, espoused to death, with blood he sealed</p>

<p>A testament of noble-ending love.</p>

<p>The pretty and sweet manner of it forced</p>

<p>Those waters from me which I would have stopped,</p>

<p>But I had not so much of man in me,</p>

<p>And all my mother came into mine eyes</p>

<p>And gave me up to tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I blame you not,</p>

<p>For, hearing this, I must perforce compound</p>

<p>With my full eyes, or they will issue too.     <i><i>[Alarum.]</i></i></p>

<p>But hark, what new alarum is this same?</p>

<p>The French have reinforced their scattered men.</p>

<p>Then every soldier kill his prisoners.</p>

<p>Give the word through.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
