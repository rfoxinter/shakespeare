<br/>

<p><sc>Chorus</sc></p>

<p>Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story</p>

<p>That I may prompt them; and of such as have,</p>

<p>I humbly pray them to admit th’ excuse</p>

<p>Of time, of numbers, and due course of things,</p>

<p>Which cannot in their huge and proper life</p>

<p>Be here presented. Now we bear the King</p>

<p>Toward Calais. Grant him there. There seen,</p>

<p>Heave him away upon your winged thoughts</p>

<p>Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach</p>

<p>Pales in the flood with men, wives, and boys,</p>

<p>Whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep-mouthed</p>

<p>sea,</p>

<p>Which, like a mighty whiffler ’fore the King</p>

<p>Seems to prepare his way. So let him land,</p>

<p>And solemnly see him set on to London.</p>

<p>So swift a pace hath thought that even now</p>

<p>You may imagine him upon Blackheath,</p>

<p>Where that his lords desire him to have borne</p>

<p>His bruised helmet and his bended sword</p>

<p>Before him through the city. He forbids it,</p>

<p>Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride,</p>

<p>Giving full trophy, signal, and ostent</p>

<p>Quite from himself, to God. But now behold,</p>

<p>In the quick forge and workinghouse of thought,</p>

<p>How London doth pour out her citizens.</p>

<p>The Mayor and all his brethren in best sort,</p>

<p>Like to the senators of th’ antique Rome,</p>

<p>With the plebeians swarming at their heels,</p>

<p>Go forth and fetch their conqu’ring Caesar in–</p>

<p>As, by a lower but by loving likelihood</p>

<p>Were now the general of our gracious empress,</p>

<p>As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,</p>

<p>Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,</p>

<p>How many would the peaceful city quit</p>

<p>To welcome him! Much more, and much more</p>

<p>cause,</p>

<p>Did they this Harry. Now in London place him</p>

<p>(As yet the lamentation of the French</p>

<p>Invites the King of England’s stay at home;</p>

<p>The Emperor’s coming in behalf of France</p>

<p>To order peace between them) and omit</p>

<p>All the occurrences, whatever chanced,</p>

<p>Till Harry’s back return again to France.</p>

<p>There must we bring him, and myself have played</p>

<p>The interim, by remembering you ’tis past.</p>

<p>Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance</p>

<p>After your thoughts, straight back again to France.</p>
