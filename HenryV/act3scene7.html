<p><center><i>[Enter the Constable of France, the Lord Rambures,</p>

<p>Orleans, Dauphin, with others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Tut, I have the best armor of the world.</p>

<p>Would it were day!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  You have an excellent armor, but let my</p>

<p>horse have his due.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  It is the best horse of Europe.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  Will it never be morning?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  My Lord of Orleans and my Lord High Constable,</p>

<p>you talk of horse and armor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  You are as well provided of both as any</p>

<p>prince in the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  What a long night is this! I will not change</p>

<p>my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.</p>

<p>Ca, ha! He bounds from the earth, as if his</p>

<p>entrails were hairs, le cheval volant, the Pegasus, qui</p>

<p>a les narines de feu. When I bestride him, I soar; I</p>

<p>am a hawk; he trots the air. The earth sings when he</p>

<p>touches it. The basest horn of his hoof is more</p>

<p>musical than the pipe of Hermes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  He’s of the color of the nutmeg.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for</p>

<p>Perseus. He is pure air and fire, and the dull</p>

<p>elements of earth and water never appear in him,</p>

<p>but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts</p>

<p>him. He is indeed a horse, and all other jades you</p>

<p>may call beasts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and</p>

<p>excellent horse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like</p>

<p>the bidding of a monarch, and his countenance</p>

<p>enforces homage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  No more, cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from</p>

<p>the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb,</p>

<p>vary deserved praise on my palfrey. It is a theme as</p>

<p>fluent as the sea. Turn the sands into eloquent</p>

<p>tongues, and my horse is argument for them all. ’Tis</p>

<p>a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a</p>

<p>sovereign’s sovereign to ride on, and for the world,</p>

<p>familiar to us and unknown, to lay apart their</p>

<p>particular functions and wonder at him. I once writ</p>

<p>a sonnet in his praise and began thus: “Wonder of</p>

<p>nature–”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  I have heard a sonnet begin so to one’s</p>

<p>mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  Then did they imitate that which I composed</p>

<p>to my courser, for my horse is my mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  Your mistress bears well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  Me well–which is the prescript praise and</p>

<p>perfection of a good and particular mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress</p>

<p>shrewdly shook your back.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  So perhaps did yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Mine was not bridled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  O, then belike she was old and gentle, and</p>

<p>you rode like a kern of Ireland, your French hose</p>

<p>off, and in your strait strossers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  You have good judgment in horsemanship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  Be warned by me, then: they that ride so, and</p>

<p>ride not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have</p>

<p>my horse to my mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  I had as lief have my mistress a jade.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his</p>

<p>own hair.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  I could make as true a boast as that if I had</p>

<p>a sow to my mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  “Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement,</p>

<p>et la truie lavee au bourbier.” Thou mak’st use</p>

<p>of anything.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress,</p>

<p>or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rambures</span>  My Lord Constable, the armor that I saw in</p>

<p>your tent tonight, are those stars or suns upon it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Stars, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  And yet my sky shall not want.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  That may be, for you bear a many superfluously,</p>

<p>and ’twere more honor some were away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Ev’n as your horse bears your praises–</p>

<p>who would trot as well were some of your brags</p>

<p>dismounted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  Would I were able to load him with his</p>

<p>desert! Will it never be day? I will trot tomorrow a</p>

<p>mile, and my way shall be paved with English faces.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  I will not say so for fear I should be faced</p>

<p>out of my way. But I would it were morning, for I</p>

<p>would fain be about the ears of the English.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rambures</span>  Who will go to hazard with me for twenty</p>

<p>prisoners?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  You must first go yourself to hazard ere you</p>

<p>have them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dauphin</span>  ’Tis midnight. I’ll go arm myself.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  The Dauphin longs for morning.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rambures</span>  He longs to eat the English.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  I think he will eat all he kills.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  By the white hand of my lady, he’s a gallant</p>

<p>prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Swear by her foot, that she may tread out</p>

<p>the oath.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  He is simply the most active gentleman of</p>

<p>France.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Doing is activity, and he will still be doing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  He never did harm, that I heard of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Nor will do none tomorrow. He will keep</p>

<p>that good name still.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  I know him to be valiant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  I was told that by one that knows him</p>

<p>better than you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  What’s he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Marry, he told me so himself, and he said</p>

<p>he cared not who knew it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  He needs not. It is no hidden virtue in him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  By my faith, sir, but it is; never anybody</p>

<p>saw it but his lackey. ’Tis a hooded valor, and when</p>

<p>it appears, it will bate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  Ill will never said well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  I will cap that proverb with “There is</p>

<p>flattery in friendship.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  And I will take up that with “Give the devil</p>

<p>his due.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Well placed; there stands your friend for</p>

<p>the devil. Have at the very eye of that proverb with</p>

<p>“A pox of the devil.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  You are the better at proverbs, by how much</p>

<p>“A fool’s bolt is soon shot.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  You have shot over.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  ’Tis not the first time you were overshot.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  My Lord High Constable, the English lie</p>

<p>within fifteen hundred paces of your tents.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Who hath measured the ground?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  The Lord Grandpre.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  A valiant and most expert gentleman.–</p>

<p>Would it were day! Alas, poor Harry of England! He</p>

<p>longs not for the dawning as we do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  What a wretched and peevish fellow is this</p>

<p>King of England to mope with his fat-brained</p>

<p>followers so far out of his knowledge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  If the English had any apprehension, they</p>

<p>would run away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  That they lack; for if their heads had any</p>

<p>intellectual armor, they could never wear such</p>

<p>heavy headpieces.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rambures</span>  That island of England breeds very valiant</p>

<p>creatures. Their mastiffs are of unmatchable</p>

<p>courage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  Foolish curs, that run winking into the</p>

<p>mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads</p>

<p>crushed like rotten apples. You may as well say</p>

<p>that’s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the</p>

<p>lip of a lion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Just, just; and the men do sympathize with</p>

<p>the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on,</p>

<p>leaving their wits with their wives. And then give</p>

<p>them great meals of beef and iron and steel, they</p>

<p>will eat like wolves and fight like devils.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span>  Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of</p>

<p>beef.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Constable</span>  Then shall we find tomorrow they have</p>

<p>only stomachs to eat and none to fight. Now is it</p>

<p>time to arm. Come, shall we about it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orleans</span></p>

<p>It is now two o’clock. But, let me see, by ten</p>

<p>We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.</p>
