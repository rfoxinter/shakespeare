<p><center><i>[Enter the King of France, the Dauphin, the Duke of</p>

<p>Brittany, the Constable of France, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>’Tis certain he hath passed the river Somme.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constable</sc></p>

<p>An if he be not fought withal, my lord,</p>

<p>Let us not live in France. Let us quit all,</p>

<p>And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>O Dieu vivant, shall a few sprays of us,</p>

<p>The emptying of our fathers’ luxury,</p>

<p>Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,</p>

<p>Spurt up so suddenly into the clouds</p>

<p>And overlook their grafters?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brittany</sc></p>

<p>Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!</p>

<p>Mort de ma vie, if they march along</p>

<p>Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom</p>

<p>To buy a slobb’ry and a dirty farm</p>

<p>In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constable</sc></p>

<p>Dieu de batailles, where have they this mettle?</p>

<p>Is not their climate foggy, raw, and dull,</p>

<p>On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,</p>

<p>Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,</p>

<p>A drench for sur-reined jades, their barley broth,</p>

<p>Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?</p>

<p>And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,</p>

<p>Seem frosty? O, for honor of our land,</p>

<p>Let us not hang like roping icicles</p>

<p>Upon our houses’ thatch, whiles a more frosty</p>

<p>people</p>

<p>Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!</p>

<p>“Poor” we may call them in their native lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc>  By faith and honor,</p>

<p>Our madams mock at us and plainly say</p>

<p>Our mettle is bred out, and they will give</p>

<p>Their bodies to the lust of English youth</p>

<p>To new-store France with bastard warriors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brittany</sc></p>

<p>They bid us to the English dancing-schools,</p>

<p>And teach lavoltas high, and swift corantos,</p>

<p>Saying our grace is only in our heels</p>

<p>And that we are most lofty runaways.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>Where is Montjoy the herald? Speed him hence.</p>

<p>Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.</p>

<p>Up, princes, and, with spirit of honor edged</p>

<p>More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:</p>

<p>Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France;</p>

<p>You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri,</p>

<p>Alencon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;</p>

<p>Jacques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,</p>

<p>Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Faulconbridge,</p>

<p>Foix, Lestrale, Bouciquault, and Charolois;</p>

<p>High dukes, great princes, barons, lords, and</p>

<p>knights,</p>

<p>For your great seats now quit you of great shames.</p>

<p>Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land</p>

<p>With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur.</p>

<p>Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow</p>

<p>Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat</p>

<p>The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon.</p>

<p>Go down upon him–you have power enough–</p>

<p>And in a captive chariot into Rouen</p>

<p>Bring him our prisoner.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Constable</sc>  This becomes the great!</p>

<p>Sorry am I his numbers are so few,</p>

<p>His soldiers sick and famished in their march,</p>

<p>For, I am sure, when he shall see our army,</p>

<p>He’ll drop his heart into the sink of fear</p>

<p>And for achievement offer us his ransom.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>Therefore, Lord Constable, haste on Montjoy,</p>

<p>And let him say to England that we send</p>

<p>To know what willing ransom he will give.–</p>

<p>Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dauphin</sc></p>

<p>Not so, I do beseech your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Be patient, for you shall remain with us.–</p>

<p>Now forth, Lord Constable and princes all,</p>

<p>And quickly bring us word of England’s fall.</p>
