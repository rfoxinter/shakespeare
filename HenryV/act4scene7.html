<p><center><i>[Enter Fluellen and Gower.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Kill the poys and the luggage! ’Tis expressly</p>

<p>against the law of arms. ’Tis as arrant a piece of</p>

<p>knavery, mark you now, as can be offert, in your</p>

<p>conscience now, is it not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  ’Tis certain there’s not a boy left alive, and</p>

<p>the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha’</p>

<p>done this slaughter. Besides, they have burned</p>

<p>and carried away all that was in the King’s tent,</p>

<p>wherefore the King, most worthily, hath caused</p>

<p>every soldier to cut his prisoner’s throat. O, ’tis a</p>

<p>gallant king!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain</p>

<p>Gower. What call you the town’s name where</p>

<p>Alexander the Pig was born?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Alexander the Great.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Why, I pray you, is not “pig” great? The pig,</p>

<p>or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the</p>

<p>magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the</p>

<p>phrase is a little variations.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon.</p>

<p>His father was called Philip of Macedon, as I</p>

<p>take it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is</p>

<p>porn. I tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of</p>

<p>the ’orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons</p>

<p>between Macedon and Monmouth, that the</p>

<p>situations, look you, is both alike. There is a river in</p>

<p>Macedon, and there is also, moreover, a river at</p>

<p>Monmouth. It is called Wye at Monmouth, but it is</p>

<p>out of my prains what is the name of the other river.</p>

<p>But ’tis all one; ’tis alike as my fingers is to my</p>

<p>fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you mark</p>

<p>Alexander’s life well, Harry of Monmouth’s life is</p>

<p>come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in</p>

<p>all things. Alexander, God knows and you know, in</p>

<p>his rages and his furies and his wraths and his</p>

<p>cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his</p>

<p>indignations, and also being a little intoxicates in</p>

<p>his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you,</p>

<p>kill his best friend, Cleitus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Our king is not like him in that. He never</p>

<p>killed any of his friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  It is not well done, mark you now, to take</p>

<p>the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and</p>

<p>finished. I speak but in the figures and comparisons</p>

<p>of it. As Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in</p>

<p>his ales and his cups, so also Harry Monmouth,</p>

<p>being in his right wits and his good judgments,</p>

<p>turned away the fat knight with the great-belly</p>

<p>doublet; he was full of jests and gipes and knaveries</p>

<p>and mocks–I have forgot his name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Sir John Falstaff.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  That is he. I’ll tell you, there is good men</p>

<p>porn at Monmouth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Here comes his Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Alarum. Enter King Harry, Exeter, Warwick, Gloucester,</p>

<p>Heralds and Bourbon with other prisoners. Flourish.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>I was not angry since I came to France</p>

<p>Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald.</p>

<p>Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill.</p>

<p>If they will fight with us, bid them come down,</p>

<p>Or void the field. They do offend our sight.</p>

<p>If they’ll do neither, we will come to them</p>

<p>And make them skirr away as swift as stones</p>

<p>Enforced from the old Assyrian slings.</p>

<p>Besides, we’ll cut the throats of those we have,</p>

<p>And not a man of them that we shall take</p>

<p>Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Montjoy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>His eyes are humbler than they used to be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>How now, what means this, herald? Know’st thou</p>

<p>not</p>

<p>That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?</p>

<p>Com’st thou again for ransom?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montjoy</sc>  No, great king.</p>

<p>I come to thee for charitable license,</p>

<p>That we may wander o’er this bloody field</p>

<p>To book our dead and then to bury them,</p>

<p>To sort our nobles from our common men,</p>

<p>For many of our princes–woe the while!–</p>

<p>Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood.</p>

<p>So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs</p>

<p>In blood of princes, and the wounded steeds</p>

<p>Fret fetlock deep in gore, and with wild rage</p>

<p>Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,</p>

<p>Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,</p>

<p>To view the field in safety and dispose</p>

<p>Of their dead bodies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I tell thee truly, herald,</p>

<p>I know not if the day be ours or no,</p>

<p>For yet a many of your horsemen peer</p>

<p>And gallop o’er the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montjoy</sc>  The day is yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!</p>

<p>What is this castle called that stands hard by?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montjoy</sc>  They call it Agincourt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Then call we this the field of Agincourt,</p>

<p>Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Your grandfather of famous memory, an ’t</p>

<p>please your Majesty, and your great-uncle Edward</p>

<p>the Plack Prince of Wales, as I have read in the</p>

<p>chronicles, fought a most prave pattle here in</p>

<p>France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  They did, Fluellen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Your Majesty says very true. If your Majesties</p>

<p>is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good</p>

<p>service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing</p>

<p>leeks in their Monmouth caps, which, your Majesty</p>

<p>know, to this hour is an honorable badge of the</p>

<p>service. And I do believe your Majesty takes no</p>

<p>scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy’s day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>I wear it for a memorable honor,</p>

<p>For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  All the water in Wye cannot wash your</p>

<p>Majesty’s Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell</p>

<p>you that. God pless it and preserve it as long as it</p>

<p>pleases his Grace and his Majesty too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Thanks, good my countryman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  By Jeshu, I am your Majesty’s countryman,</p>

<p>I care not who know it. I will confess it to all the</p>

<p>’orld. I need not to be ashamed of your Majesty,</p>

<p>praised be God, so long as your Majesty is an</p>

<p>honest man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>God keep me so.–Our heralds, go with him.</p>

<p>Bring me just notice of the numbers dead</p>

<p>On both our parts.</p>

<p><center><i>[Montjoy, English Heralds, and Gower exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Williams.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Call yonder fellow hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc>  Soldier, you must come to the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Soldier, why wear’st thou that glove in thy</p>

<p>cap?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  An ’t please your Majesty, ’tis the gage of</p>

<p>one that I should fight withal, if he be alive.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  An Englishman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  An ’t please your Majesty, a rascal that</p>

<p>swaggered with me last night, who, if alive and ever</p>

<p>dare to challenge this glove, I have sworn to take</p>

<p>him a box o’ th’ ear, or if I can see my glove in his</p>

<p>cap, which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would</p>

<p>wear if alive, I will strike it out soundly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  What think you, Captain Fluellen, is it fit</p>

<p>this soldier keep his oath?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  He is a craven and a villain else, an ’t</p>

<p>please your Majesty, in my conscience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  It may be his enemy is a gentleman of</p>

<p>great sort, quite from the answer of his degree.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Though he be as good a gentleman as the</p>

<p>devil is, as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself, it is</p>

<p>necessary, look your Grace, that he keep his vow</p>

<p>and his oath. If he be perjured, see you now, his</p>

<p>reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as</p>

<p>ever his black shoe trod upon God’s ground and His</p>

<p>earth, in my conscience, la.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou</p>

<p>meet’st the fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  So I will, my liege, as I live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Who serv’st thou under?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  Under Captain Gower, my liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge</p>

<p>and literatured in the wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Call him hither to me, soldier.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Williams</sc>  I will, my liege.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc> <i>[giving Fluellen Williams’s glove]</i>  Here,</p>

<p>Fluellen, wear thou this favor for me, and stick it in</p>

<p>thy cap. When Alencon and myself were down</p>

<p>together, I plucked this glove from his helm. If any</p>

<p>man challenge this, he is a friend to Alencon and an</p>

<p>enemy to our person. If thou encounter any such,</p>

<p>apprehend him, an thou dost me love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc> <i>[putting the glove in his cap]</i>  Your Grace</p>

<p>does me as great honors as can be desired in the</p>

<p>hearts of his subjects. I would fain see the man that</p>

<p>has but two legs that shall find himself aggriefed at</p>

<p>this glove, that is all; but I would fain see it once, an</p>

<p>please God of His grace that I might see.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Know’st thou Gower?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  He is my dear friend, an please you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to</p>

<p>my tent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  I will fetch him.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester,</p>

<p>Follow Fluellen closely at the heels.</p>

<p>The glove which I have given him for a favor</p>

<p>May haply purchase him a box o’ th’ ear.</p>

<p>It is the soldier’s. I by bargain should</p>

<p>Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick.</p>

<p>If that the soldier strike him, as I judge</p>

<p>By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,</p>

<p>Some sudden mischief may arise of it,</p>

<p>For I do know Fluellen valiant</p>

<p>And, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,</p>

<p>And quickly will return an injury.</p>

<p>Follow, and see there be no harm between them.–</p>

<p>Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.</p>
