<p><center><i>[Enter Nym, Bardolph, Pistol, and Boy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  On, on, on, on, on! To the breach, to the</p>

<p>breach!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc>  Pray thee, corporal, stay. The knocks are too hot,</p>

<p>and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives.</p>

<p>The humor of it is too hot; that is the very plainsong</p>

<p>of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  “The plainsong” is most just, for humors do</p>

<p>abound.</p>

<p>Knocks go and come. God’s vassals drop and die,</p>

<p><i>[Sings]</i>        <i>And sword and shield,</i></p>

<p>        <i>In bloody field,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Doth win immortal fame.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would</p>

<p>give all my fame for a pot of ale, and safety.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  And I.</p>

<p><i>[Sings]</i>     <i>If wishes would prevail with me,</i></p>

<p>     <i>My purpose should not fail with me,</i></p>

<p>        <i>But thither would I hie.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc> <i>[sings]</i>        <i>As duly,</i></p>

<p>        <i>But not as truly,</i></p>

<p>     <i>As bird doth sing on bough.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fluellen.</p>

<p>]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc></p>

<p>Up to the breach, you dogs! Avaunt, you cullions!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Be merciful, great duke, to men of mold. Abate</p>

<p>thy rage, abate thy manly rage, abate thy rage, great</p>

<p>duke. Good bawcock, ’bate thy rage. Use lenity,</p>

<p>sweet chuck.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc> <i>[to Fluellen]</i>  These be good humors. Your Honor</p>

<p>wins bad humors.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but the Boy exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  As young as I am, I have observed these three</p>

<p>swashers. I am boy to them all three, but all they</p>

<p>three, though they would serve me, could not be</p>

<p>man to me. For indeed three such antics do not</p>

<p>amount to a man: for Bardolph, he is white-livered</p>

<p>and red-faced, by the means whereof he faces it out</p>

<p>but fights not; for Pistol, he hath a killing tongue</p>

<p>and a quiet sword, by the means whereof he breaks</p>

<p>words and keeps whole weapons; for Nym, he hath</p>

<p>heard that men of few words are the best men, and</p>

<p>therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest he should</p>

<p>be thought a coward, but his few bad words are</p>

<p>matched with as few good deeds, for he never broke</p>

<p>any man’s head but his own, and that was against a</p>

<p>post when he was drunk. They will steal anything</p>

<p>and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute case, bore</p>

<p>it twelve leagues, and sold it for three halfpence.</p>

<p>Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching,</p>

<p>and in Calais they stole a fire shovel. I knew by that</p>

<p>piece of service the men would carry coals. They</p>

<p>would have me as familiar with men’s pockets as</p>

<p>their gloves or their handkerchers, which makes</p>

<p>much against my manhood, if I should take from</p>

<p>another’s pocket to put into mine, for it is plain</p>

<p>pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them and seek</p>

<p>some better service. Their villainy goes against my</p>

<p>weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fluellen and Gower.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to</p>

<p>the mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak</p>

<p>with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  To the mines? Tell you the Duke it is not so</p>

<p>good to come to the mines, for, look you, the mines</p>

<p>is not according to the disciplines of the war. The</p>

<p>concavities of it is not sufficient, for, look you, th’</p>

<p>athversary, you may discuss unto the Duke, look</p>

<p>you, is digt himself four yard under the countermines.</p>

<p>By Cheshu, I think he will plow up all if</p>

<p>there is not better directions.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of</p>

<p>the siege is given, is altogether directed by an</p>

<p>Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i’ faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  I think it be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world. I</p>

<p>will verify as much in his beard. He has no more</p>

<p>directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look</p>

<p>you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy dog.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Captain Macmorris, and Captain Jamy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Here he comes, and the Scots captain, Captain</p>

<p>Jamy, with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Captain Jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman,</p>

<p>that is certain, and of great expedition and</p>

<p>knowledge in th’ aunchient wars, upon my particular</p>

<p>knowledge of his directions. By Cheshu, he will</p>

<p>maintain his argument as well as any military man</p>

<p>in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars</p>

<p>of the Romans.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jamy</sc>  I say gudday, Captain Fluellen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Godden to your Worship, good Captain</p>

<p>James.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  How now, Captain Macmorris, have you quit</p>

<p>the mines? Have the pioners given o’er?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macmorris</sc>  By Chrish, la, ’tish ill done. The work ish</p>

<p>give over. The trompet sound the retreat. By my</p>

<p>hand I swear, and my father’s soul, the work ish ill</p>

<p>done. It ish give over. I would have blowed up the</p>

<p>town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour. O, ’tish ill</p>

<p>done, ’tish ill done, by my hand, ’tish ill done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now,</p>

<p>will you voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations</p>

<p>with you as partly touching or concerning the</p>

<p>disciplines of the war, the Roman wars? In the way</p>

<p>of argument, look you, and friendly communication,</p>

<p>partly to satisfy my opinion, and partly for the</p>

<p>satisfaction, look you, of my mind, as touching the</p>

<p>direction of the military discipline, that is the point.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jamy</sc>  It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captens bath,</p>

<p>and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick</p>

<p>occasion, that sall I, marry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macmorris</sc>  It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save</p>

<p>me. The day is hot, and the weather, and the wars,</p>

<p>and the King, and the dukes. It is no time to</p>

<p>discourse. The town is beseeched. An the trumpet</p>

<p>call us to the breach and we talk and, be Chrish, do</p>

<p>nothing, ’tis shame for us all. So God sa’ me, ’tis</p>

<p>shame to stand still. It is shame, by my hand. And</p>

<p>there is throats to be cut, and works to be done,</p>

<p>and there ish nothing done, so Christ sa’ me, la.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jamy</sc>  By the Mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves</p>

<p>to slomber, ay’ll de gud service, or I’ll lig i’</p>

<p>th’ grund for it, ay, or go to death. And I’ll pay ’t as</p>

<p>valorously as I may, that sall I suerly do, that is the</p>

<p>breff and the long. Marry, I wad full fain heard</p>

<p>some question ’tween you tway.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under</p>

<p>your correction, there is not many of your</p>

<p>nation–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macmorris</sc>  Of my nation? What ish my nation? Ish a</p>

<p>villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal. What</p>

<p>ish my nation? Who talks of my nation?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Look you, if you take the matter otherwise</p>

<p>than is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I</p>

<p>shall think you do not use me with that affability as,</p>

<p>in discretion, you ought to use me, look you, being</p>

<p>as good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of</p>

<p>war and in the derivation of my birth, and in other</p>

<p>particularities.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Macmorris</sc>  I do not know you so good a man as</p>

<p>myself. So Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jamy</sc>  Ah, that’s a foul fault.</p>

<p><center><i>[A parley sounds.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  The town sounds a parley.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Captain Macmorris, when there is more</p>

<p>better opportunity to be required, look you, I will</p>

<p>be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of</p>

<p>war, and there is an end.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
