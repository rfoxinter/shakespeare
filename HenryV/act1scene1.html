<p><center><i>[Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Canterbury</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I’ll tell you that self bill is urged</p>

<p>Which in th’ eleventh year of the last king’s reign</p>

<p>Was like, and had indeed against us passed</p>

<p>But that the scambling and unquiet time</p>

<p>Did push it out of farther question.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ely</sc></p>

<p>But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Canterbury</sc></p>

<p>It must be thought on. If it pass against us,</p>

<p>We lose the better half of our possession,</p>

<p>For all the temporal lands which men devout</p>

<p>By testament have given to the Church</p>

<p>Would they strip from us, being valued thus:</p>

<p>“As much as would maintain, to the King’s honor,</p>

<p>Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,</p>

<p>Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;</p>

<p>And, to relief of lazars and weak age</p>

<p>Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,</p>

<p>A hundred almshouses right well supplied;</p>

<p>And to the coffers of the King besides,</p>

<p>A thousand pounds by th’ year.” Thus runs the bill.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ely</sc></p>

<p>This would drink deep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Canterbury</sc>  ’Twould drink the cup and</p>

<p>all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ely</sc>  But what prevention?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Canterbury</sc></p>

<p>The King is full of grace and fair regard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ely</sc></p>

<p>And a true lover of the holy Church.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Canterbury</sc></p>

<p>The courses of his youth promised it not.</p>

<p>The breath no sooner left his father’s body</p>

<p>But that his wildness, mortified in him,</p>

<p>Seemed to die too. Yea, at that very moment</p>

<p>Consideration like an angel came</p>

<p>And whipped th’ offending Adam out of him,</p>

<p>Leaving his body as a paradise</p>

<p>T’ envelop and contain celestial spirits.</p>

<p>Never was such a sudden scholar made,</p>

<p>Never came reformation in a flood</p>

<p>With such a heady currance scouring faults,</p>

<p>Nor never Hydra-headed willfulness</p>

<p>So soon did lose his seat, and all at once,</p>

<p>As in this king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ely</sc>  We are blessed in the change.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Canterbury</sc></p>

<p>Hear him but reason in divinity</p>

<p>And, all-admiring, with an inward wish</p>

<p>You would desire the King were made a prelate;</p>

<p>Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</p>

<p>You would say it hath been all in all his study;</p>

<p>List his discourse of war, and you shall hear</p>

<p>A fearful battle rendered you in music;</p>

<p>Turn him to any cause of policy,</p>

<p>The Gordian knot of it he will unloose</p>

<p>Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks,</p>

<p>The air, a chartered libertine, is still,</p>

<p>And the mute wonder lurketh in men’s ears</p>

<p>To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences;</p>

<p>So that the art and practic part of life</p>

<p>Must be the mistress to this theoric;</p>

<p>Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,</p>

<p>Since his addiction was to courses vain,</p>

<p>His companies unlettered, rude, and shallow,</p>

<p>His hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports,</p>

<p>And never noted in him any study,</p>

<p>Any retirement, any sequestration</p>

<p>From open haunts and popularity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ely</sc></p>

<p>The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,</p>

<p>And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</p>

<p>Neighbored by fruit of baser quality;</p>

<p>And so the Prince obscured his contemplation</p>

<p>Under the veil of wildness, which, no doubt,</p>

<p>Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</p>

<p>Unseen yet crescive in his faculty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Canterbury</sc></p>

<p>It must be so, for miracles are ceased,</p>

<p>And therefore we must needs admit the means</p>

<p>How things are perfected.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ely</sc>  But, my good lord,</p>

<p>How now for mitigation of this bill</p>

<p>Urged by the Commons? Doth his Majesty</p>

<p>Incline to it or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Canterbury</sc>  He seems indifferent,</p>

<p>Or rather swaying more upon our part</p>

<p>Than cherishing th’ exhibitors against us;</p>

<p>For I have made an offer to his Majesty–</p>

<p>Upon our spiritual convocation</p>

<p>And in regard of causes now in hand,</p>

<p>Which I have opened to his Grace at large,</p>

<p>As touching France–to give a greater sum</p>

<p>Than ever at one time the clergy yet</p>

<p>Did to his predecessors part withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ely</sc></p>

<p>How did this offer seem received, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Canterbury</sc></p>

<p>With good acceptance of his Majesty–</p>

<p>Save that there was not time enough to hear,</p>

<p>As I perceived his Grace would fain have done,</p>

<p>The severals and unhidden passages</p>

<p>Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms,</p>

<p>And generally to the crown and seat of France,</p>

<p>Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ely</sc></p>

<p>What was th’ impediment that broke this off?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Canterbury</sc></p>

<p>The French ambassador upon that instant</p>

<p>Craved audience. And the hour, I think, is come</p>

<p>To give him hearing. Is it four o’clock?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ely</sc>  It is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Canterbury</sc></p>

<p>Then go we in to know his embassy,</p>

<p>Which I could with a ready guess declare</p>

<p>Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bishop</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ely</sc></p>

<p>I’ll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.</p>
