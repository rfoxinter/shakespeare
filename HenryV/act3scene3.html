<p><center><i>[Enter the King of England and all his train</p>

<p>before the gates.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[to the men of Harfleur]</i></p>

<p>How yet resolves the Governor of the town?</p>

<p>This is the latest parle we will admit.</p>

<p>Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves</p>

<p>Or, like to men proud of destruction,</p>

<p>Defy us to our worst. For, as I am a soldier,</p>

<p>A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,</p>

<p>If I begin the batt’ry once again,</p>

<p>I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur</p>

<p>Till in her ashes she lie buried.</p>

<p>The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,</p>

<p>And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart,</p>

<p>In liberty of bloody hand, shall range</p>

<p>With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass</p>

<p>Your fresh fair virgins and your flow’ring infants.</p>

<p>What is it then to me if impious war,</p>

<p>Arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends,</p>

<p>Do with his smirched complexion all fell feats</p>

<p>Enlinked to waste and desolation?</p>

<p>What is ’t to me, when you yourselves are cause,</p>

<p>If your pure maidens fall into the hand</p>

<p>Of hot and forcing violation?</p>

<p>What rein can hold licentious wickedness</p>

<p>When down the hill he holds his fierce career?</p>

<p>We may as bootless spend our vain command</p>

<p>Upon th’ enraged soldiers in their spoil</p>

<p>As send precepts to the Leviathan</p>

<p>To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,</p>

<p>Take pity of your town and of your people</p>

<p>Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command,</p>

<p>Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace</p>

<p>O’erblows the filthy and contagious clouds</p>

<p>Of heady murder, spoil, and villainy.</p>

<p>If not, why, in a moment look to see</p>

<p>The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand</p>

<p>Desire the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters,</p>

<p>Your fathers taken by the silver beards</p>

<p>And their most reverend heads dashed to the walls,</p>

<p>Your naked infants spitted upon pikes</p>

<p>Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused</p>

<p>Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry</p>

<p>At Herod’s bloody-hunting slaughtermen.</p>

<p>What say you? Will you yield and this avoid</p>

<p>Or, guilty in defense, be thus destroyed?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Governor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Governor</span></p>

<p>Our expectation hath this day an end.</p>

<p>The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,</p>

<p>Returns us that his powers are yet not ready</p>

<p>To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,</p>

<p>We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.</p>

<p>Enter our gates, dispose of us and ours,</p>

<p>For we no longer are defensible.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Open your gates.     <i><i>[Governor exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Come, uncle Exeter,</p>

<p>Go you and enter Harfleur. There remain,</p>

<p>And fortify it strongly ’gainst the French.</p>

<p>Use mercy to them all for us, dear uncle.</p>

<p>The winter coming on and sickness growing</p>

<p>Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.</p>

<p>Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest.</p>

<p>Tomorrow for the march are we addressed.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish, and enter the town.]</i></center></p>
