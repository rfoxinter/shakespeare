<p><sc>Chorus</sc></p>

<p>Now entertain conjecture of a time</p>

<p>When creeping murmur and the poring dark</p>

<p>Fills the wide vessel of the universe.</p>

<p>From camp to camp, through the foul womb of</p>

<p>night,</p>

<p>The hum of either army stilly sounds,</p>

<p>That the fixed sentinels almost receive</p>

<p>The secret whispers of each other’s watch.</p>

<p>Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames</p>

<p>Each battle sees the other’s umbered face;</p>

<p>Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs</p>

<p>Piercing the night’s dull ear; and from the tents</p>

<p>The armorers, accomplishing the knights,</p>

<p>With busy hammers closing rivets up,</p>

<p>Give dreadful note of preparation.</p>

<p>The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,</p>

<p>And, the third hour of drowsy morning named,</p>

<p>Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,</p>

<p>The confident and overlusty French</p>

<p>Do the low-rated English play at dice</p>

<p>And chide the cripple, tardy-gaited night,</p>

<p>Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp</p>

<p>So tediously away. The poor condemned English,</p>

<p>Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires</p>

<p>Sit patiently and inly ruminate</p>

<p>The morning’s danger; and their gesture sad,</p>

<p>Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats,</p>

<p>Presenteth them unto the gazing moon</p>

<p>So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold</p>

<p>The royal captain of this ruined band</p>

<p>Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,</p>

<p>Let him cry, “Praise and glory on his head!”</p>

<p>For forth he goes and visits all his host,</p>

<p>Bids them good morrow with a modest smile,</p>

<p>And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.</p>

<p>Upon his royal face there is no note</p>

<p>How dread an army hath enrounded him,</p>

<p>Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color</p>

<p>Unto the weary and all-watched night,</p>

<p>But freshly looks and overbears attaint</p>

<p>With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty,</p>

<p>That every wretch, pining and pale before,</p>

<p>Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks.</p>

<p>A largesse universal, like the sun,</p>

<p>His liberal eye doth give to everyone,</p>

<p>Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all</p>

<p>Behold, as may unworthiness define,</p>

<p>A little touch of Harry in the night.</p>

<p>And so our scene must to the battle fly,</p>

<p>Where, O for pity, we shall much disgrace,</p>

<p>With four or five most vile and ragged foils</p>

<p>Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,</p>

<p>The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,</p>

<p>Minding true things by what their mock’ries be.</p>
