<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Peace to this meeting wherefor we are met.</p>

<p>Unto our brother France and to our sister,</p>

<p>Health and fair time of day.–Joy and good wishes</p>

<p>To our most fair and princely cousin Katherine.–</p>

<p>And, as a branch and member of this royalty,</p>

<p>By whom this great assembly is contrived,</p>

<p>We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy.–</p>

<p>And princes French, and peers, health to you all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>Right joyous are we to behold your face,</p>

<p>Most worthy brother England. Fairly met.–</p>

<p>So are you, princes English, every one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>So happy be the issue, brother Ireland,</p>

<p>Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,</p>

<p>As we are now glad to behold your eyes–</p>

<p>Your eyes which hitherto have borne in them</p>

<p>Against the French that met them in their bent</p>

<p>The fatal balls of murdering basilisks.</p>

<p>The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,</p>

<p>Have lost their quality, and that this day</p>

<p>Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>To cry “Amen” to that, thus we appear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>You English princes all, I do salute you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc></p>

<p>My duty to you both, on equal love,</p>

<p>Great kings of France and England. That I have</p>

<p>labored</p>

<p>With all my wits, my pains, and strong endeavors</p>

<p>To bring your most imperial Majesties</p>

<p>Unto this bar and royal interview,</p>

<p>Your Mightiness on both parts best can witness.</p>

<p>Since, then, my office hath so far prevailed</p>

<p>That face to face and royal eye to eye</p>

<p>You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me</p>

<p>If I demand before this royal view</p>

<p>What rub or what impediment there is</p>

<p>Why that the naked, poor, and mangled peace,</p>

<p>Dear nurse of arts, plenties, and joyful births,</p>

<p>Should not in this best garden of the world,</p>

<p>Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?</p>

<p>Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,</p>

<p>And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,</p>

<p>Corrupting in its own fertility.</p>

<p>Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,</p>

<p>Unpruned, dies. Her hedges, even-pleached,</p>

<p>Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,</p>

<p>Put forth disordered twigs. Her fallow leas</p>

<p>The darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory</p>

<p>Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts</p>

<p>That should deracinate such savagery.</p>

<p>The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth</p>

<p>The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover,</p>

<p>Wanting the scythe, withal uncorrected, rank,</p>

<p>Conceives by idleness, and nothing teems</p>

<p>But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burrs,</p>

<p>Losing both beauty and utility.</p>

<p>And all our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges,</p>

<p>Defective in their natures, grow to wildness.</p>

<p>Even so our houses and ourselves and children</p>

<p>Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,</p>

<p>The sciences that should become our country,</p>

<p>But grow like savages, as soldiers will</p>

<p>That nothing do but meditate on blood,</p>

<p>To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire,</p>

<p>And everything that seems unnatural.</p>

<p>Which to reduce into our former favor</p>

<p>You are assembled, and my speech entreats</p>

<p>That I may know the let why gentle peace</p>

<p>Should not expel these inconveniences</p>

<p>And bless us with her former qualities.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,</p>

<p>Whose want gives growth to th’ imperfections</p>

<p>Which you have cited, you must buy that peace</p>

<p>With full accord to all our just demands,</p>

<p>Whose tenors and particular effects</p>

<p>You have, enscheduled briefly, in your hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc></p>

<p>The King hath heard them, to the which as yet</p>

<p>There is no answer made.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Well then, the peace which you before so urged</p>

<p>Lies in his answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>I have but with a cursitory eye</p>

<p>O’erglanced the articles. Pleaseth your Grace</p>

<p>To appoint some of your council presently</p>

<p>To sit with us once more with better heed</p>

<p>To resurvey them, we will suddenly</p>

<p>Pass our accept and peremptory answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Brother, we shall.–Go, uncle Exeter,</p>

<p>And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,</p>

<p>Warwick, and Huntington, go with the King,</p>

<p>And take with you free power to ratify,</p>

<p>Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best</p>

<p>Shall see advantageable for our dignity,</p>

<p>Anything in or out of our demands,</p>

<p>And we’ll consign thereto.–Will you, fair sister,</p>

<p>Go with the princes or stay here with us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>Our gracious brother, I will go with them.</p>

<p>Haply a woman’s voice may do some good</p>

<p>When articles too nicely urged be stood on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us.</p>

<p>She is our capital demand, comprised</p>

<p>Within the forerank of our articles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>She hath good leave.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Katherine, and the King of England,</p>

<p>and Alice exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Fair Katherine, and most fair,</p>

<p>Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms</p>

<p>Such as will enter at a lady’s ear</p>

<p>And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Your Majesty shall mock at me. I cannot</p>

<p>speak your England.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  O fair Katherine, if you will love me</p>

<p>soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to</p>

<p>hear you confess it brokenly with your English</p>

<p>tongue. Do you like me, Kate?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell wat is “like</p>

<p>me.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  An angel is like you, Kate, and you are</p>

<p>like an angel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc> <i>[to Alice]</i>  Que dit-il? Que je suis semblable a</p>

<p>les anges?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alice</sc>  Oui, vraiment, sauf votre Grace, ainsi dit-il.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I said so, dear Katherine, and I must not</p>

<p>blush to affirm it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  O bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont</p>

<p>pleines de tromperies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc> <i>[to Alice]</i>  What says she, fair one? That the</p>

<p>tongues of men are full of deceits?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alice</sc>  Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of</p>

<p>deceits; dat is de Princess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  The Princess is the better Englishwoman.–</p>

<p>I’ faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy</p>

<p>understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no</p>

<p>better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst</p>

<p>find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I</p>

<p>had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways</p>

<p>to mince it in love, but directly to say “I love you.”</p>

<p>Then if you urge me farther than to say “Do you, in</p>

<p>faith?” I wear out my suit. Give me your answer, i’</p>

<p>faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain. How say</p>

<p>you, lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Sauf votre honneur, me understand well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Marry, if you would put me to verses or</p>

<p>to dance for your sake, Kate, why you undid me.</p>

<p>For the one, I have neither words nor measure; and</p>

<p>for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a</p>

<p>reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a</p>

<p>lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with</p>

<p>my armor on my back, under the correction of</p>

<p>bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a</p>

<p>wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my</p>

<p>horse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher</p>

<p>and sit like a jackanapes, never off. But, before God,</p>

<p>Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence,</p>

<p>nor I have no cunning in protestation, only</p>

<p>downright oaths, which I never use till urged, nor</p>

<p>never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of</p>

<p>this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sun-burning,</p>

<p>that never looks in his glass for love of</p>

<p>anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I</p>

<p>speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for</p>

<p>this, take me. If not, to say to thee that I shall die is</p>

<p>true, but for thy love, by the Lord, no. Yet I love thee</p>

<p>too. And while thou liv’st, dear Kate, take a fellow of</p>

<p>plain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must</p>

<p>do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in</p>

<p>other places. For these fellows of infinite tongue,</p>

<p>that can rhyme themselves into ladies’ favors, they</p>

<p>do always reason themselves out again. What? A</p>

<p>speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad, a</p>

<p>good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black</p>

<p>beard will turn white, a curled pate will grow bald,</p>

<p>a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow, but</p>

<p>a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or</p>

<p>rather the sun and not the moon, for it shines bright</p>

<p>and never changes but keeps his course truly. If</p>

<p>thou would have such a one, take me. And take me,</p>

<p>take a soldier. Take a soldier, take a king. And what</p>

<p>say’st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and</p>

<p>fairly, I pray thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of</p>

<p>France?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  No, it is not possible you should love the</p>

<p>enemy of France, Kate. But, in loving me, you</p>

<p>should love the friend of France, for I love France</p>

<p>so well that I will not part with a village of it. I will</p>

<p>have it all mine. And, Kate, when France is mine</p>

<p>and I am yours, then yours is France and you are</p>

<p>mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  I cannot tell wat is dat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  No, Kate? I will tell thee in French,</p>

<p>which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a</p>

<p>new-married wife about her husband’s neck, hardly</p>

<p>to be shook off. Je quand sur le possession de</p>

<p>France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi–let</p>

<p>me see, what then? Saint Denis be my speed!–donc</p>

<p>votre est France, et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for</p>

<p>me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so</p>

<p>much more French. I shall never move thee in</p>

<p>French, unless it be to laugh at me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Sauf votre honneur, le francais que vous</p>

<p>parlez, il est meilleur que l’anglais lequel je parle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  No, faith, is ’t not, Kate, but thy speaking</p>

<p>of my tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely must</p>

<p>needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost</p>

<p>thou understand thus much English? Canst thou</p>

<p>love me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  I cannot tell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate? I’ll</p>

<p>ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me; and at</p>

<p>night, when you come into your closet, you’ll question</p>

<p>this gentlewoman about me, and, I know, Kate,</p>

<p>you will, to her, dispraise those parts in me that you</p>

<p>love with your heart. But, good Kate, mock me</p>

<p>mercifully, the rather, gentle princess, because I</p>

<p>love thee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I</p>

<p>have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I</p>

<p>get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore</p>

<p>needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou</p>

<p>and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound</p>

<p>a boy, half French, half English, that shall go</p>

<p>to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?</p>

<p>Shall we not? What say’st thou, my fair flower de</p>

<p>luce?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  I do not know dat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  No, ’tis hereafter to know, but now to</p>

<p>promise. Do but now promise, Kate, you will</p>

<p>endeavor for your French part of such a boy; and</p>

<p>for my English moiety, take the word of a king and</p>

<p>a bachelor. How answer you, la plus belle Katherine</p>

<p>du monde, mon tres cher et divin deesse?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Your Majeste ’ave fausse French enough to</p>

<p>deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Now fie upon my false French. By mine</p>

<p>honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate. By which</p>

<p>honor I dare not swear thou lovest me, yet my blood</p>

<p>begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding</p>

<p>the poor and untempering effect of my visage. Now</p>

<p>beshrew my father’s ambition! He was thinking of</p>

<p>civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created</p>

<p>with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that</p>

<p>when I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in</p>

<p>faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear.</p>

<p>My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of</p>

<p>beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou</p>

<p>hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou shalt</p>

<p>wear me, if thou wear me, better and better. And</p>

<p>therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have</p>

<p>me? Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the</p>

<p>thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress,</p>

<p>take me by the hand, and say “Harry of England, I</p>

<p>am thine,” which word thou shalt no sooner bless</p>

<p>mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud “England</p>

<p>is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry</p>

<p>Plantagenet is thine,” who, though I speak it before</p>

<p>his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou</p>

<p>shalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your</p>

<p>answer in broken music, for thy voice is music, and</p>

<p>thy English broken. Therefore, queen of all, Katherine,</p>

<p>break thy mind to me in broken English. Wilt</p>

<p>thou have me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Dat is as it shall please de roi mon pere.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall</p>

<p>please him, Kate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Den it sall also content me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you</p>

<p>my queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez! Ma</p>

<p>foi, je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur,</p>

<p>en baisant la main d’ une–Notre Seigneur!–</p>

<p>indigne serviteur. Excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon</p>

<p>tres puissant seigneur.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Les dames et demoiselles, pour etre baisees</p>

<p>devant leurs noces, il n’est pas la coutume de France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Madam my interpreter, what says she?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alice</sc>  Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of</p>

<p>France–I cannot tell wat is baiser en Anglish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  To kiss.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alice</sc>  Your Majeste entendre bettre que moi.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  It is not a fashion for the maids in France</p>

<p>to kiss before they are married, would she say?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alice</sc>  Oui, vraiment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great</p>

<p>kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined</p>

<p>within the weak list of a country’s fashion. We are</p>

<p>the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that</p>

<p>follows our places stops the mouth of all find-faults,</p>

<p>as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of</p>

<p>your country in denying me a kiss. Therefore,</p>

<p>patiently and yielding. <i>[He kisses her.]</i> You have</p>

<p>witchcraft in your lips, Kate. There is more eloquence</p>

<p>in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues</p>

<p>of the French council, and they should sooner</p>

<p>persuade Harry of England than a general petition</p>

<p>of monarchs.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the French power, the French King and Queen</p>

<p>and Burgundy, and the English Lords Westmoreland</p>

<p>and Exeter.]</i></center></p>

<p>Here comes your father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc>  God save your Majesty. My royal cousin,</p>

<p>teach you our princess English?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I would have her learn, my fair cousin,</p>

<p>how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc>  Is she not apt?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition</p>

<p>is not smooth, so that, having neither the voice</p>

<p>nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so</p>

<p>conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will</p>

<p>appear in his true likeness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc>  Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I</p>

<p>answer you for that. If you would conjure in her,</p>

<p>you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her in</p>

<p>his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind.</p>

<p>Can you blame her, then, being a maid yet rosed</p>

<p>over with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny</p>

<p>the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked</p>

<p>seeing self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a</p>

<p>maid to consign to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Yet they do wink and yield, as love is</p>

<p>blind and enforces.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc>  They are then excused, my lord, when they</p>

<p>see not what they do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to</p>

<p>consent winking.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc>  I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if</p>

<p>you will teach her to know my meaning, for maids</p>

<p>well summered and warm kept are like flies at</p>

<p>Bartholomew-tide: blind, though they have their</p>

<p>eyes; and then they will endure handling, which</p>

<p>before would not abide looking on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  This moral ties me over to time and a hot</p>

<p>summer. And so I shall catch the fly, your cousin,</p>

<p>in the latter end, and she must be blind too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc>  As love is, my lord, before it loves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  It is so. And you may, some of you, thank</p>

<p>love for my blindness, who cannot see many a fair</p>

<p>French city for one fair French maid that stands in</p>

<p>my way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc>  Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively,</p>

<p>the cities turned into a maid, for they are all</p>

<p>girdled with maiden walls that war hath never</p>

<p>entered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Shall Kate be my wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc>  So please you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I am content, so the maiden cities you</p>

<p>talk of may wait on her. So the maid that stood in</p>

<p>the way for my wish shall show me the way to my</p>

<p>will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>We have consented to all terms of reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Is ’t so, my lords of England?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Westmoreland</sc></p>

<p>The King hath granted every article,</p>

<p>His daughter first, and, in sequel, all,</p>

<p>According to their firm proposed natures.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>Only he hath not yet subscribed this:</p>

<p>Where your Majesty demands that the King of</p>

<p>France, having any occasion to write for matter of</p>

<p>grant, shall name your Highness in this form and</p>

<p>with this addition, in French: Notre tres cher fils</p>

<p>Let that one article rank with the rest,</p>

<p>And thereupon give me your daughter.</p>

<p>Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up</p>

<p>Issue to me, that the contending kingdoms</p>

<p>Of France and England, whose very shores look pale</p>

<p>With envy of each other’s happiness,</p>

<p>May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction</p>

<p>Plant neighborhood and Christian-like accord</p>

<p>In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance</p>

<p>His bleeding sword ’twixt England and fair France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lords</sc>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Now welcome, Kate, and bear me witness all</p>

<p>That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kisses her. Flourish.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>France</sc></p>

<p>God, the best maker of all marriages,</p>

<p>Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one.</p>

<p>As man and wife, being two, are one in love,</p>

<p>So be there ’twixt your kingdoms such a spousal</p>

<p>That never may ill office or fell jealousy,</p>

<p>Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,</p>

<p>Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms</p>

<p>To make divorce of their incorporate league,</p>

<p>That English may as French, French Englishmen,</p>

<p>Receive each other. God speak this Amen!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Prepare we for our marriage; on which day,</p>

<p>My Lord of Burgundy, we’ll take your oath,</p>

<p>And all the peers’, for surety of our leagues.</p>

<p>Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me,</p>

<p>And may our oaths well kept and prosp’rous be.</p>
