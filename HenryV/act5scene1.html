<p><center><i>[Enter Fluellen and Gower.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Nay, that’s right. But why wear you your leek</p>

<p>today? Saint Davy’s day is past.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  There is occasions and causes why and</p>

<p>wherefore in all things. I will tell you ass my</p>

<p>friend, Captain Gower. The rascally, scald, beggarly,</p>

<p>lousy, pragging knave Pistol, which you and</p>

<p>yourself and all the world know to be no petter than</p>

<p>a fellow, look you now, of no merits, he is come to</p>

<p>me and prings me pread and salt yesterday, look</p>

<p>you, and bid me eat my leek. It was in a place where</p>

<p>I could not breed no contention with him, but I will</p>

<p>be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once</p>

<p>again, and then I will tell him a little piece of my</p>

<p>desires.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pistol.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Why here he comes, swelling like a</p>

<p>turkey-cock.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  ’Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his</p>

<p>turkey-cocks.–God pless you, Aunchient Pistol,</p>

<p>you scurvy, lousy knave, God pless you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Ha, art thou bedlam? Dost thou thirst, base</p>

<p>Trojan, to have me fold up Parca’s fatal web? Hence.</p>

<p>I am qualmish at the smell of leek.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  I peseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave,</p>

<p>at my desires and my requests and my petitions, to</p>

<p>eat, look you, this leek. Because, look you, you do</p>

<p>not love it, nor your affections and your appetites</p>

<p>and your disgestions does not agree with it, I would</p>

<p>desire you to eat it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  There is one goat for you. <i>[(Strikes him</p>

<p>with a cudgel.)]</i> Will you be so good, scald knave,</p>

<p>as eat it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Base Trojan, thou shalt die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  You say very true, scald knave, when God’s</p>

<p>will is. I will desire you to live in the meantime and</p>

<p>eat your victuals. Come, there is sauce for it. <i>[Strikes</p>

<p>him.]</i> You called me yesterday “mountain squire,”</p>

<p>but I will make you today a squire of low degree. I</p>

<p>pray you, fall to. If you can mock a leek, you can eat</p>

<p>a leek.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Enough, captain. You have astonished him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  I say I will make him eat some part of my</p>

<p>leek, or I will peat his pate four days.–Bite, I pray</p>

<p>you. It is good for your green wound and your</p>

<p>ploody coxcomb.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Must I bite?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of</p>

<p>question, too, and ambiguities.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  By this leek, I will most horribly revenge.</p>

<p><i>[Fluellen threatens him.]</i> I eat and eat, I swear–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Eat, I pray you. Will you have some more</p>

<p>sauce to your leek? There is not enough leek to</p>

<p>swear by.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Quiet thy cudgel. Thou dost see I eat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Much good do you, scald knave, heartily.</p>

<p>Nay, pray you throw none away. The skin is good for</p>

<p>your broken coxcomb. When you take occasions to</p>

<p>see leeks hereafter, I pray you mock at ’em, that is</p>

<p>all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Ay, leeks is good. Hold you, there is a groat</p>

<p>to heal your pate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Me, a groat?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  Yes, verily, and in truth you shall take it, or I</p>

<p>have another leek in my pocket, which you shall</p>

<p>eat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  I take thy groat in earnest of revenge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fluellen</sc>  If I owe you anything, I will pay you in</p>

<p>cudgels. You shall be a woodmonger and buy</p>

<p>nothing of me but cudgels. God be wi’ you and</p>

<p>keep you and heal your pate.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  All hell shall stir for this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc>  Go, go. You are a counterfeit cowardly knave.</p>

<p>Will you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon</p>

<p>an honorable respect and worn as a memorable</p>

<p>trophy of predeceased valor, and dare not avouch in</p>

<p>your deeds any of your words? I have seen you</p>

<p>gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or</p>

<p>thrice. You thought because he could not speak</p>

<p>English in the native garb, he could not therefore</p>

<p>handle an English cudgel. You find it otherwise, and</p>

<p>henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good</p>

<p>English condition. Fare you well.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?</p>

<p>News have I that my Doll is dead i’ th’ spital of a</p>

<p>malady of France, and there my rendezvous is quite</p>

<p>cut off. Old I do wax, and from my weary limbs</p>

<p>honor is cudgeled. Well, bawd I’ll turn, and something</p>

<p>lean to cutpurse of quick hand. To England</p>

<p>will I steal, and there I’ll steal.</p>

<p>And patches will I get unto these cudgeled scars,</p>

<p>And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.</p>
