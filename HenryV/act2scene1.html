<p><center><i>[Enter Corporal Nym and Lieutenant Bardolph.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Well met, Corporal Nym.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends</p>

<p>yet?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  For my part, I care not. I say little, but when time</p>

<p>shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that shall be as</p>

<p>it may. I dare not fight, but I will wink and hold out</p>

<p>mine iron. It is a simple one, but what though? It</p>

<p>will toast cheese, and it will endure cold as another</p>

<p>man’s sword will, and there’s an end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  I will bestow a breakfast to make you</p>

<p>friends, and we’ll be all three sworn brothers to</p>

<p>France. Let ’t be so, good Corporal Nym.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  Faith, I will live so long as I may, that’s the</p>

<p>certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I</p>

<p>will do as I may. That is my rest, that is the</p>

<p>rendezvous of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  It is certain, corporal, that he is married to</p>

<p>Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for</p>

<p>you were troth-plight to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  I cannot tell. Things must be as they may. Men</p>

<p>may sleep, and they may have their throats about</p>

<p>them at that time, and some say knives have edges.</p>

<p>It must be as it may. Though patience be a tired</p>

<p>mare, yet she will plod. There must be conclusions.</p>

<p>Well, I cannot tell.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pistol and Hostess Quickly.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife.</p>

<p>Good corporal, be patient here.–How now, mine</p>

<p>host Pistol?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Base tyke, call’st thou me host? Now, by this</p>

<p>hand, I swear I scorn the term, nor shall my Nell</p>

<p>keep lodgers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hostess</span>  No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot</p>

<p>lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen</p>

<p>that live honestly by the prick of their needles but it</p>

<p>will be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.</p>

<p><center><i>[Nym and Pistol draw their swords.]</i></center></p>

<p>O well-a-day, Lady! If he be not hewn now, we shall</p>

<p>see willful adultery and murder committed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Good lieutenant, good corporal, offer nothing</p>

<p>here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  Pish!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Pish for thee, Iceland dog, thou prick-eared</p>

<p>cur of Iceland!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hostess</span>  Good Corporal Nym, show thy valor, and put</p>

<p>up your sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  Will you shog off? <i>[To Pistol.]</i> I would have you</p>

<p>solus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  ”Solus, egregious dog? O viper vile, the solus</p>

<p>in thy most marvelous face, the solus in thy teeth</p>

<p>and in thy throat and in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy</p>

<p>maw, perdy, and, which is worse, within thy nasty</p>

<p>mouth! I do retort the solus in thy bowels, for I can</p>

<p>take, and Pistol’s cock is up, and flashing fire will</p>

<p>follow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  I am not Barbason, you cannot conjure me. I</p>

<p>have an humor to knock you indifferently well. If</p>

<p>you grow foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with</p>

<p>my rapier, as I may, in fair terms. If you would walk</p>

<p>off, I would prick your guts a little in good terms, as</p>

<p>I may, and that’s the humor of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span></p>

<p>O braggart vile and damned furious wight,</p>

<p>The grave doth gape, and doting death is near.</p>

<p>Therefore exhale.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes</p>

<p>the first stroke, I’ll run him up to the hilts, as I am a</p>

<p>soldier.     <i><i>[He draws.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.</p>

<p><center><i>[Pistol and Nym and then Bardolph</p>

<p>sheathe their swords.]</i></center></p>

<p>Give me thy fist, thy forefoot to me give. Thy spirits</p>

<p>are most tall.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span> <i>[to Pistol]</i>  I will cut thy throat one time or other</p>

<p>in fair terms, that is the humor of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Couple a gorge, that is the word. I defy thee</p>

<p>again. O hound of Crete, think’st thou my spouse to</p>

<p>get? No, to the spital go, and from the powd’ring tub</p>

<p>of infamy fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid’s kind,</p>

<p>Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse. I</p>

<p>have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly for the</p>

<p>only she: and pauca, there’s enough too! Go to.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Boy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master,</p>

<p>and your hostess. He is very sick and would to</p>

<p>bed.–Good Bardolph, put thy face between his</p>

<p>sheets, and do the office of a warming-pan. Faith,</p>

<p>he’s very ill.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Away, you rogue!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hostess</span>  By my troth, he’ll yield the crow a pudding</p>

<p>one of these days. The King has killed his heart.</p>

<p>Good husband, come home presently.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits with the Boy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Come, shall I make you two friends? We</p>

<p>must to France together. Why the devil should we</p>

<p>keep knives to cut one another’s throats?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span></p>

<p>Let floods o’erswell and fiends for food howl on!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  You’ll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at</p>

<p>betting?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Base is the slave that pays.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  That now I will have, that’s the humor of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  As manhood shall compound. Push home.</p>

<p><center><i>[They draw.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span> <i>[drawing his sword]</i>  By this sword, he that</p>

<p>makes the first thrust, I’ll kill him. By this sword, I</p>

<p>will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span> <i>[sheathing his sword]</i>  “Sword” is an oath, and</p>

<p>oaths must have their course.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bardolph</span>  Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be</p>

<p>friends; an thou wilt not, why then be enemies with</p>

<p>me too. Prithee, put up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span> <i>[to Nym]</i>  A noble shalt thou have, and present</p>

<p>pay, and liquor likewise will I give to thee, and</p>

<p>friendship shall combine, and brotherhood. I’ll live</p>

<p>by Nym, and Nym shall live by me. Is not this just?</p>

<p>For I shall sutler be unto the camp, and profits will</p>

<p>accrue. Give me thy hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  I shall have my noble?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  In cash, most justly paid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  Well, then, that’s the humor of ’t.</p>

<p><center><i>[Nym and Bardolph sheathe their swords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hostess.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hostess</span>  As ever you come of women, come in quickly</p>

<p>to Sir John. Ah, poor heart, he is so shaked of a</p>

<p>burning quotidian-tertian that it is most lamentable</p>

<p>to behold. Sweet men, come to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  The King hath run bad humors on the knight,</p>

<p>that’s the even of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Nym, thou hast spoke the right. His heart is</p>

<p>fracted and corroborate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nym</span>  The King is a good king, but it must be as it may;</p>

<p>he passes some humors and careers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pistol</span>  Let us condole the knight, for, lambkins, we</p>

<p>will live.</p>
