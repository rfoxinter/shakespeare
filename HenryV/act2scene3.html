<p><center><i>[Enter Pistol, Nym, Bardolph, Boy, and Hostess.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring</p>

<p>thee to Staines.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  No; for my manly heart doth earn.–Bardolph,</p>

<p>be blithe.–Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins.– Boy,</p>

<p>bristle thy courage up. For Falstaff, he is dead, and</p>

<p>we must earn therefore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Would I were with him, wheresome’er he</p>

<p>is, either in heaven or in hell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Nay, sure, he’s not in hell! He’s in Arthur’s</p>

<p>bosom, if ever man went to Arthur’s bosom. He</p>

<p>made a finer end, and went away an it had been any</p>

<p>christom child. He parted ev’n just between twelve</p>

<p>and one, ev’n at the turning o’ th’ tide; for after I saw</p>

<p>him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers</p>

<p>and smile upon his finger’s end, I knew there was</p>

<p>but one way, for his nose was as sharp as a pen and</p>

<p>he talked of green fields. “How now, Sir John?”</p>

<p>quoth I. “What, man, be o’ good cheer!” So he cried</p>

<p>out “God, God, God!” three or four times. Now I, to</p>

<p>comfort him, bid him he should not think of God; I</p>

<p>hoped there was no need to trouble himself with</p>

<p>any such thoughts yet. So he bade me lay more</p>

<p>clothes on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and</p>

<p>felt them, and they were as cold as any stone. Then I</p>

<p>felt to his knees, and so upward and upward, and</p>

<p>all was as cold as any stone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc>  They say he cried out of sack.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Ay, that he did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  And of women.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Nay, that he did not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Yes, that he did, and said they were devils</p>

<p>incarnate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  He could never abide carnation. ’Twas a</p>

<p>color he never liked.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  He said once, the devil would have him about</p>

<p>women.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  He did in some sort, indeed, handle women,</p>

<p>but then he was rheumatic and talked of the Whore</p>

<p>of Babylon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon</p>

<p>Bardolph’s nose, and he said it was a black soul</p>

<p>burning in hell?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc>  Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that</p>

<p>fire. That’s all the riches I got in his service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc>  Shall we shog? The King will be gone from</p>

<p>Southampton.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Come, let’s away.–My love, give me thy lips.</p>

<p><i>[They kiss.]</i> Look to my chattels and my movables.</p>

<p>Let senses rule. The word is “Pitch and pay.” Trust</p>

<p>none, for oaths are straws, men’s faiths are wafer-cakes,</p>

<p>and Holdfast is the only dog, my duck.</p>

<p>Therefore, Caveto be thy counselor. Go, clear thy</p>

<p>crystals.–Yoke-fellows in arms, let us to France,</p>

<p>like horse-leeches, my boys, to suck, to suck, the</p>

<p>very blood to suck.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  And that’s but unwholesome food, they say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc>  Touch her soft mouth, and march.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bardolph</sc> <i>[kissing the Hostess]</i>  Farewell, hostess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nym</sc>  I cannot kiss, that is the humor of it. But adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pistol</sc> <i>[to the Hostess]</i>  Let huswifery appear. Keep</p>

<p>close, I thee command.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  Farewell. Adieu.</p>
