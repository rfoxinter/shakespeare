<p><center><i>[Enter the King of England, Humphrey Duke of</p>

<p>Gloucester, Bedford, Clarence, Warwick, Westmoreland,</p>

<p>and Exeter, with other Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>Not here in presence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  Send for him, good uncle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>Shall we call in th’ Ambassador, my liege?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Not yet, my cousin. We would be resolved,</p>

<p>Before we hear him, of some things of weight</p>

<p>That task our thoughts concerning us and France.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bishop</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Canterbury</span></p>

<p>God and his angels guard your sacred throne</p>

<p>And make you long become it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  Sure we thank you.</p>

<p>My learned lord, we pray you to proceed</p>

<p>And justly and religiously unfold</p>

<p>Why the law Salic that they have in France</p>

<p>Or should or should not bar us in our claim.</p>

<p>And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</p>

<p>That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your</p>

<p>reading,</p>

<p>Or nicely charge your understanding soul</p>

<p>With opening titles miscreate, whose right</p>

<p>Suits not in native colors with the truth;</p>

<p>For God doth know how many now in health</p>

<p>Shall drop their blood in approbation</p>

<p>Of what your reverence shall incite us to.</p>

<p>Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,</p>

<p>How you awake our sleeping sword of war.</p>

<p>We charge you in the name of God, take heed,</p>

<p>For never two such kingdoms did contend</p>

<p>Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops</p>

<p>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint</p>

<p>’Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the</p>

<p>swords</p>

<p>That makes such waste in brief mortality.</p>

<p>Under this conjuration, speak, my lord,</p>

<p>For we will hear, note, and believe in heart</p>

<p>That what you speak is in your conscience washed</p>

<p>As pure as sin with baptism.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bishop</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Canterbury</span></p>

<p>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers</p>

<p>That owe yourselves, your lives, and services</p>

<p>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</p>

<p>To make against your Highness’ claim to France</p>

<p>But this, which they produce from Pharamond:</p>

<p>“In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant</p>

<p>(No woman shall succeed in Salic land),</p>

<p>Which Salic land the French unjustly gloze</p>

<p>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</p>

<p>The founder of this law and female bar.</p>

<p>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</p>

<p>That the land Salic is in Germany,</p>

<p>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe,</p>

<p>Where Charles the Great, having subdued the</p>

<p>Saxons,</p>

<p>There left behind and settled certain French,</p>

<p>Who, holding in disdain the German women</p>

<p>For some dishonest manners of their life,</p>

<p>Established then this law: to wit, no female</p>

<p>Should be inheritrix in Salic land,</p>

<p>Which ”Salic,“ as I said, ’twixt Elbe and Sala</p>

<p>Is at this day in Germany called Meissen.</p>

<p>Then doth it well appear the Salic law</p>

<p>Was not devised for the realm of France,</p>

<p>Nor did the French possess the Salic land</p>

<p>Until four hundred one and twenty years</p>

<p>After defunction of King Pharamond,</p>

<p>Idly supposed the founder of this law,</p>

<p>Who died within the year of our redemption</p>

<p>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</p>

<p>Subdued the Saxons and did seat the French</p>

<p>Beyond the river Sala in the year</p>

<p>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</p>

<p>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</p>

<p>Did, as heir general, being descended</p>

<p>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</p>

<p>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</p>

<p>Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</p>

<p>Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</p>

<p>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</p>

<p>To find his title with some shows of truth,</p>

<p>Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,</p>

<p>Conveyed himself as th’ heir to th’ Lady Lingare,</p>

<p>Daughter to Charlemagne, who was the son</p>

<p>To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son</p>

<p>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</p>

<p>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</p>

<p>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</p>

<p>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</p>

<p>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</p>

<p>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</p>

<p>Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine:</p>

<p>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</p>

<p>Was reunited to the crown of France.</p>

<p>So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun,</p>

<p>King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim,</p>

<p>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</p>

<p>To hold in right and title of the female.</p>

<p>So do the kings of France unto this day,</p>

<p>Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law</p>

<p>To bar your Highness claiming from the female,</p>

<p>And rather choose to hide them in a net</p>

<p>Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</p>

<p>Usurped from you and your progenitors.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>May I with right and conscience make this claim?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bishop</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Canterbury</span></p>

<p>The sin upon my head, dread sovereign,</p>

<p>For in the Book of Numbers is it writ:</p>

<p>”When the man dies, let the inheritance</p>

<p>Descend unto the daughter.“ Gracious lord,</p>

<p>Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag,</p>

<p>Look back into your mighty ancestors.</p>

<p>Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire’s tomb,</p>

<p>From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit</p>

<p>And your great-uncle’s, Edward the Black Prince,</p>

<p>Who on the French ground played a tragedy,</p>

<p>Making defeat on the full power of France</p>

<p>Whiles his most mighty father on a hill</p>

<p>Stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp</p>

<p>Forage in blood of French nobility.</p>

<p>O noble English, that could entertain</p>

<p>With half their forces the full pride of France</p>

<p>And let another half stand laughing by,</p>

<p>All out of work and cold for action!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bishop</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ely</span></p>

<p>Awake remembrance of these valiant dead</p>

<p>And with your puissant arm renew their feats.</p>

<p>You are their heir, you sit upon their throne,</p>

<p>The blood and courage that renowned them</p>

<p>Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege</p>

<p>Is in the very May-morn of his youth,</p>

<p>Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>Your brother kings and monarchs of the Earth</p>

<p>Do all expect that you should rouse yourself</p>

<p>As did the former lions of your blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Westmoreland</span></p>

<p>They know your Grace hath cause and means and</p>

<p>might;</p>

<p>So hath your Highness. Never king of England</p>

<p>Had nobles richer, and more loyal subjects,</p>

<p>Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England</p>

<p>And lie pavilioned in the fields of France.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bishop</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Canterbury</span></p>

<p>O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,</p>

<p>With blood and sword and fire to win your right,</p>

<p>In aid whereof we of the spiritualty</p>

<p>Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum</p>

<p>As never did the clergy at one time</p>

<p>Bring in to any of your ancestors.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>We must not only arm t’ invade the French,</p>

<p>But lay down our proportions to defend</p>

<p>Against the Scot, who will make road upon us</p>

<p>With all advantages.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bishop</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Canterbury</span></p>

<p>They of those marches, gracious sovereign,</p>

<p>Shall be a wall sufficient to defend</p>

<p>Our inland from the pilfering borderers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,</p>

<p>But fear the main intendment of the Scot,</p>

<p>Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us.</p>

<p>For you shall read that my great-grandfather</p>

<p>Never went with his forces into France</p>

<p>But that the Scot on his unfurnished kingdom</p>

<p>Came pouring like the tide into a breach</p>

<p>With ample and brim fullness of his force,</p>

<p>Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,</p>

<p>Girding with grievous siege castles and towns,</p>

<p>That England, being empty of defense,</p>

<p>Hath shook and trembled at th’ ill neighborhood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bishop</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Canterbury</span></p>

<p>She hath been then more feared than harmed, my</p>

<p>liege,</p>

<p>For hear her but exampled by herself:</p>

<p>When all her chivalry hath been in France</p>

<p>And she a mourning widow of her nobles,</p>

<p>She hath herself not only well defended</p>

<p>But taken and impounded as a stray</p>

<p>The King of Scots, whom she did send to France</p>

<p>To fill King Edward’s fame with prisoner kings</p>

<p>And make her chronicle as rich with praise</p>

<p>As is the ooze and bottom of the sea</p>

<p>With sunken wrack and sumless treasuries.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bishop</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ely</span></p>

<p>But there’s a saying very old and true:</p>

<p>     <i>”If that you will France win,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Then with Scotland first begin.“</i></p>

<p>For once the eagle England being in prey,</p>

<p>To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot</p>

<p>Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,</p>

<p>Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,</p>

<p>To ’tame and havoc more than she can eat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>It follows, then, the cat must stay at home.</p>

<p>Yet that is but a crushed necessity,</p>

<p>Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries</p>

<p>And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.</p>

<p>While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,</p>

<p>Th’ advised head defends itself at home.</p>

<p>For government, though high and low and lower,</p>

<p>Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,</p>

<p>Congreeing in a full and natural close,</p>

<p>Like music.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bishop</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Canterbury</span>  Therefore doth heaven divide</p>

<p>The state of man in divers functions,</p>

<p>Setting endeavor in continual motion,</p>

<p>To which is fixed as an aim or butt</p>

<p>Obedience; for so work the honeybees,</p>

<p>Creatures that by a rule in nature teach</p>

<p>The act of order to a peopled kingdom.</p>

<p>They have a king and officers of sorts,</p>

<p>Where some like magistrates correct at home,</p>

<p>Others like merchants venture trade abroad,</p>

<p>Others like soldiers armed in their stings</p>

<p>Make boot upon the summer’s velvet buds,</p>

<p>Which pillage they with merry march bring home</p>

<p>To the tent royal of their emperor,</p>

<p>Who, busied in his majesty, surveys</p>

<p>The singing masons building roofs of gold,</p>

<p>The civil citizens kneading up the honey,</p>

<p>The poor mechanic porters crowding in</p>

<p>Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,</p>

<p>The sad-eyed justice with his surly hum</p>

<p>Delivering o’er to executors pale</p>

<p>The lazy yawning drone. I this infer:</p>

<p>That many things, having full reference</p>

<p>To one consent, may work contrariously,</p>

<p>As many arrows loosed several ways</p>

<p>Come to one mark, as many ways meet in one town,</p>

<p>As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea,</p>

<p>As many lines close in the dial’s center,</p>

<p>So may a thousand actions, once afoot,</p>

<p>End in one purpose and be all well borne</p>

<p>Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege!</p>

<p>Divide your happy England into four,</p>

<p>Whereof take you one quarter into France,</p>

<p>And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.</p>

<p>If we, with thrice such powers left at home,</p>

<p>Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,</p>

<p>Let us be worried, and our nation lose</p>

<p>The name of hardiness and policy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.</p>

<p><center><i>[Attendants exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now are we well resolved, and by God’s help</p>

<p>And yours, the noble sinews of our power,</p>

<p>France being ours, we’ll bend it to our awe</p>

<p>Or break it all to pieces. Or there we’ll sit,</p>

<p>Ruling in large and ample empery</p>

<p>O’er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,</p>

<p>Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,</p>

<p>Tombless, with no remembrance over them.</p>

<p>Either our history shall with full mouth</p>

<p>Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,</p>

<p>Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,</p>

<p>Not worshiped with a waxen epitaph.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ambassadors of France, with Attendants.</p>

<p>]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure</p>

<p>Of our fair cousin Dauphin, for we hear</p>

<p>Your greeting is from him, not from the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ambassador</span></p>

<p>May ’t please your Majesty to give us leave</p>

<p>Freely to render what we have in charge,</p>

<p>Or shall we sparingly show you far off</p>

<p>The Dauphin’s meaning and our embassy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>We are no tyrant, but a Christian king,</p>

<p>Unto whose grace our passion is as subject</p>

<p>As is our wretches fettered in our prisons.</p>

<p>Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness</p>

<p>Tell us the Dauphin’s mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ambassador</span>  Thus, then, in few:</p>

<p>Your Highness, lately sending into France,</p>

<p>Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right</p>

<p>Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third;</p>

<p>In answer of which claim, the Prince our master</p>

<p>Says that you savor too much of your youth</p>

<p>And bids you be advised there’s naught in France</p>

<p>That can be with a nimble galliard won;</p>

<p>You cannot revel into dukedoms there.</p>

<p>He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,</p>

<p>This tun of treasure and, in lieu of this,</p>

<p>Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim</p>

<p>Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>What treasure, uncle?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span>  Tennis balls,</p>

<p>my liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.</p>

<p>His present and your pains we thank you for.</p>

<p>When we have matched our rackets to these balls,</p>

<p>We will in France, by God’s grace, play a set</p>

<p>Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard.</p>

<p>Tell him he hath made a match with such a</p>

<p>wrangler</p>

<p>That all the courts of France will be disturbed</p>

<p>With chases. And we understand him well,</p>

<p>How he comes o’er us with our wilder days,</p>

<p>Not measuring what use we made of them.</p>

<p>We never valued this poor seat of England,</p>

<p>And therefore, living hence, did give ourself</p>

<p>To barbarous license, as ’tis ever common</p>

<p>That men are merriest when they are from home.</p>

<p>But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,</p>

<p>Be like a king, and show my sail of greatness</p>

<p>When I do rouse me in my throne of France,</p>

<p>For that I have laid by my majesty</p>

<p>And plodded like a man for working days;</p>

<p>But I will rise there with so full a glory</p>

<p>That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,</p>

<p>Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.</p>

<p>And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his</p>

<p>Hath turned his balls to gun-stones, and his soul</p>

<p>Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance</p>

<p>That shall fly with them; for many a thousand</p>

<p>widows</p>

<p>Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands,</p>

<p>Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;</p>

<p>And some are yet ungotten and unborn</p>

<p>That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin’s scorn.</p>

<p>But this lies all within the will of God,</p>

<p>To whom I do appeal, and in whose name</p>

<p>Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,</p>

<p>To venge me as I may and to put forth</p>

<p>My rightful hand in a well-hallowed cause.</p>

<p>So get you hence in peace. And tell the Dauphin</p>

<p>His jest will savor but of shallow wit</p>

<p>When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.–</p>

<p>Convey them with safe conduct.–Fare you well.</p>

<p><center><i>[Ambassadors exit, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span>  This was a merry message.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>We hope to make the sender blush at it.</p>

<p>Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour</p>

<p>That may give furth’rance to our expedition;</p>

<p>For we have now no thought in us but France,</p>

<p>Save those to God, that run before our business.</p>

<p>Therefore let our proportions for these wars</p>

<p>Be soon collected, and all things thought upon</p>

<p>That may with reasonable swiftness add</p>

<p>More feathers to our wings. For, God before,</p>

<p>We’ll chide this Dauphin at his father’s door.</p>

<p>Therefore let every man now task his thought,</p>

<p>That this fair action may on foot be brought.</p>
