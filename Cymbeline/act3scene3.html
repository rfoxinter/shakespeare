<p><center><i>[Enter, as from a cave, Belarius as Morgan, Guiderius</p>

<p>as Polydor, and Arviragus as Cadwal.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i></p>

<p>A goodly day not to keep house with such</p>

<p>Whose roof’s as low as ours! Stoop, boys. This gate</p>

<p>Instructs you how t’ adore the heavens and bows you</p>

<p>To a morning’s holy office. The gates of monarchs</p>

<p>Are arched so high that giants may jet through</p>

<p>And keep their impious turbans on, without</p>

<p>Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!</p>

<p>We house i’ th’ rock, yet use thee not so hardly</p>

<p>As prouder livers do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  Hail, heaven!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  Hail, heaven!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i></p>

<p>Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill;</p>

<p>Your legs are young. I’ll tread these flats. Consider,</p>

<p>When you above perceive me like a crow,</p>

<p>That it is place which lessens and sets off,</p>

<p>And you may then revolve what tales I have told you</p>

<p>Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.</p>

<p>This service is not service, so being done,</p>

<p>But being so allowed. To apprehend thus</p>

<p>Draws us a profit from all things we see,</p>

<p>And often, to our comfort, shall we find</p>

<p>The sharded beetle in a safer hold</p>

<p>Than is the full-winged eagle. O, this life</p>

<p>Is nobler than attending for a check,</p>

<p>Richer than doing nothing for a robe,</p>

<p>Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:</p>

<p>Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine</p>

<p>Yet keeps his book uncrossed. No life to ours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>Out of your proof you speak. We poor unfledged</p>

<p>Have never winged from view o’ th’ nest, nor know</p>

<p>not</p>

<p>What air ’s from home. Haply this life is best</p>

<p>If quiet life be best, sweeter to you</p>

<p>That have a sharper known, well corresponding</p>

<p>With your stiff age; but unto us it is</p>

<p>A cell of ignorance, traveling abed,</p>

<p>A prison for a debtor that not dares</p>

<p>To stride a limit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  What should we speak of</p>

<p>When we are old as you? When we shall hear</p>

<p>The rain and wind beat dark December, how</p>

<p>In this our pinching cave shall we discourse</p>

<p>The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing.</p>

<p>We are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey,</p>

<p>Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat.</p>

<p>Our valor is to chase what flies. Our cage</p>

<p>We make a choir, as doth the prisoned bird,</p>

<p>And sing our bondage freely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  How you speak!</p>

<p>Did you but know the city’s usuries</p>

<p>And felt them knowingly; the art o’ th’ court,</p>

<p>As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb</p>

<p>Is certain falling, or so slipp’ry that</p>

<p>The fear’s as bad as falling; the toil o’ th’ war,</p>

<p>A pain that only seems to seek out danger</p>

<p>I’ th’ name of fame and honor, which dies i’ th’ search</p>

<p>And hath as oft a sland’rous epitaph</p>

<p>As record of fair act–nay, many times</p>

<p>Doth ill deserve by doing well; what’s worse,</p>

<p>Must curtsy at the censure. O boys, this story</p>

<p>The world may read in me. My body’s marked</p>

<p>With Roman swords, and my report was once</p>

<p>First with the best of note. Cymbeline loved me,</p>

<p>And when a soldier was the theme, my name</p>

<p>Was not far off. Then was I as a tree</p>

<p>Whose boughs did bend with fruit. But in one night</p>

<p>A storm or robbery, call it what you will,</p>

<p>Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,</p>

<p>And left me bare to weather.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  Uncertain favor!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i></p>

<p>My fault being nothing, as I have told you oft,</p>

<p>But that two villains, whose false oaths prevailed</p>

<p>Before my perfect honor, swore to Cymbeline</p>

<p>I was confederate with the Romans. So</p>

<p>Followed my banishment; and this twenty years</p>

<p>This rock and these demesnes have been my world,</p>

<p>Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid</p>

<p>More pious debts to heaven than in all</p>

<p>The fore-end of my time. But up to th’ mountains!</p>

<p>This is not hunters’ language. He that strikes</p>

<p>The venison first shall be the lord o’ th’ feast;</p>

<p>To him the other two shall minister,</p>

<p>And we will fear no poison, which attends</p>

<p>In place of greater state. I’ll meet you in the valleys.</p>

<p><center><i>[Guiderius and Arviragus exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc></p>

<p>How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!</p>

<p>These boys know little they are sons to th’ King,</p>

<p>Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.</p>

<p>They think they are mine, and, though trained up</p>

<p>thus meanly,</p>

<p>I’ th’ cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit</p>

<p>The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them</p>

<p>In simple and low things to prince it much</p>

<p>Beyond the trick of others. This Polydor,</p>

<p>The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who</p>

<p>The King his father called Guiderius–Jove!</p>

<p>When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell</p>

<p>The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out</p>

<p>Into my story; say “Thus mine enemy fell,</p>

<p>And thus I set my foot on ’s neck,” even then</p>

<p>The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,</p>

<p>Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture</p>

<p>That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,</p>

<p>Once Arviragus, in as like a figure</p>

<p>Strikes life into my speech and shows much more</p>

<p>His own conceiving. Hark, the game is roused!</p>

<p>O Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows</p>

<p>Thou didst unjustly banish me; whereon,</p>

<p>At three and two years old I stole these babes,</p>

<p>Thinking to bar thee of succession as</p>

<p>Thou refts me of my lands. Euriphile,</p>

<p>Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their</p>

<p>mother,</p>

<p>And every day do honor to her grave.</p>

<p>Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan called,</p>

<p>They take for natural father. The game is up!</p>
