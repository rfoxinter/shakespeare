<p><center><i>[Enter two Gentlemen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>You do not meet a man but frowns. Our bloods</p>

<p>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers’</p>

<p>Still seem as does the King’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  But what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>His daughter, and the heir of ’s kingdom, whom</p>

<p>He purposed to his wife’s sole son–a widow</p>

<p>That late he married–hath referred herself</p>

<p>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She’s wedded,</p>

<p>Her husband banished, she imprisoned. All</p>

<p>Is outward sorrow, though I think the King</p>

<p>Be touched at very heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  None but the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>He that hath lost her, too. So is the Queen,</p>

<p>That most desired the match. But not a courtier,</p>

<p>Although they wear their faces to the bent</p>

<p>Of the King’s looks, hath a heart that is not</p>

<p>Glad at the thing they scowl at.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  And why so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>He that hath missed the Princess is a thing</p>

<p>Too bad for bad report, and he that hath her–</p>

<p>I mean, that married her, alack, good man!</p>

<p>And therefore banished–is a creature such</p>

<p>As, to seek through the regions of the Earth</p>

<p>For one his like, there would be something failing</p>

<p>In him that should compare. I do not think</p>

<p>So fair an outward and such stuff within</p>

<p>Endows a man but he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  You speak him far.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>I do extend him, sir, within himself,</p>

<p>Crush him together rather than unfold</p>

<p>His measure duly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  What’s his name and birth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>I cannot delve him to the root. His father</p>

<p>Was called Sicilius, who did join his honor</p>

<p>Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</p>

<p>But had his titles by Tenantius, whom</p>

<p>He served with glory and admired success,</p>

<p>So gained the sur-addition Leonatus;</p>

<p>And had, besides this gentleman in question,</p>

<p>Two other sons, who in the wars o’ th’ time</p>

<p>Died with their swords in hand. For which their</p>

<p>father,</p>

<p>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow</p>

<p>That he quit being; and his gentle lady,</p>

<p>Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased</p>

<p>As he was born. The King he takes the babe</p>

<p>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</p>

<p>Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber,</p>

<p>Puts to him all the learnings that his time</p>

<p>Could make him the receiver of, which he took</p>

<p>As we do air, fast as ’twas ministered,</p>

<p>And in ’s spring became a harvest; lived in court–</p>

<p>Which rare it is to do–most praised, most loved,</p>

<p>A sample to the youngest, to th’ more mature</p>

<p>A glass that feated them, and to the graver</p>

<p>A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,</p>

<p>For whom he now is banished, her own price</p>

<p>Proclaims how she esteemed him; and his virtue</p>

<p>By her election may be truly read</p>

<p>What kind of man he is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  I honor him</p>

<p>Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,</p>

<p>Is she sole child to th’ King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  His only child.</p>

<p>He had two sons–if this be worth your hearing,</p>

<p>Mark it–the eldest of them at three years old,</p>

<p>I’ th’ swathing clothes the other, from their nursery</p>

<p>Were stol’n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge</p>

<p>Which way they went.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  How long is this ago?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Some twenty years.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>That a king’s children should be so conveyed,</p>

<p>So slackly guarded, and the search so slow</p>

<p>That could not trace them!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Howsoe’er ’tis strange,</p>

<p>Or that the negligence may well be laughed at,</p>

<p>Yet is it true, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  I do well believe you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>We must forbear. Here comes the gentleman,</p>

<p>The Queen and Princess.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Queen, Posthumus, and Imogen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,</p>

<p>After the slander of most stepmothers,</p>

<p>Evil-eyed unto you. You’re my prisoner, but</p>

<p>Your jailer shall deliver you the keys</p>

<p>That lock up your restraint.–For you, Posthumus,</p>

<p>So soon as I can win th’ offended king,</p>

<p>I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet</p>

<p>The fire of rage is in him, and ’twere good</p>

<p>You leaned unto his sentence with what patience</p>

<p>Your wisdom may inform you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  Please your Highness,</p>

<p>I will from hence today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  You know the peril.</p>

<p>I’ll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying</p>

<p>The pangs of barred affections, though the King</p>

<p>Hath charged you should not speak together.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc>  O,</p>

<p>Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant</p>

<p>Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,</p>

<p>I something fear my father’s wrath, but nothing–</p>

<p>Always reserved my holy duty–what</p>

<p>His rage can do on me. You must be gone,</p>

<p>And I shall here abide the hourly shot</p>

<p>Of angry eyes, not comforted to live</p>

<p>But that there is this jewel in the world</p>

<p>That I may see again.     <i><i>[She weeps.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  My queen, my mistress!</p>

<p>O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause</p>

<p>To be suspected of more tenderness</p>

<p>Than doth become a man. I will remain</p>

<p>The loyal’st husband that did e’er plight troth.</p>

<p>My residence in Rome at one Philario’s,</p>

<p>Who to my father was a friend, to me</p>

<p>Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,</p>

<p>And with mine eyes I’ll drink the words you send,</p>

<p>Though ink be made of gall.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Queen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Be brief, I pray you.</p>

<p>If the King come, I shall incur I know not</p>

<p>How much of his displeasure. <i>[(Aside.)]</i> Yet I’ll move</p>

<p>him</p>

<p>To walk this way. I never do him wrong</p>

<p>But he does buy my injuries, to be friends,</p>

<p>Pays dear for my offenses.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  Should we be taking leave</p>

<p>As long a term as yet we have to live,</p>

<p>The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc>  Nay, stay a little!</p>

<p>Were you but riding forth to air yourself,</p>

<p>Such parting were too petty. Look here, love:</p>

<p>This diamond was my mother’s. <i>[(She offers a</p>

<p>ring.)]</i> Take it, heart,</p>

<p>But keep it till you woo another wife</p>

<p>When Imogen is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  How, how? Another?</p>

<p>You gentle gods, give me but this I have,</p>

<p>And cere up my embracements from a next</p>

<p>With bonds of death.     <i><i>[(He puts the ring on his finger.)]</i></i></p>

<p>Remain, remain thou here,</p>

<p>While sense can keep it on.–And sweetest, fairest,</p>

<p>As I my poor self did exchange for you</p>

<p>To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles</p>

<p>I still win of you. For my sake, wear this.</p>

<p><center><i>[He offers a bracelet.]</i></center></p>

<p>It is a manacle of love. I’ll place it</p>

<p>Upon this fairest prisoner.     <i><i>[He puts it on her wrist.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc>  O the gods!</p>

<p>When shall we see again?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cymbeline and Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  Alack, the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>Thou basest thing, avoid hence, from my sight!</p>

<p>If after this command thou fraught the court</p>

<p>With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!</p>

<p>Thou ’rt poison to my blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  The gods protect you,</p>

<p>And bless the good remainders of the court.</p>

<p>I am gone.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc>  There cannot be a pinch in death</p>

<p>More sharp than this is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  O disloyal thing</p>

<p>That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap’st</p>

<p>A year’s age on me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc>  I beseech you, sir,</p>

<p>Harm not yourself with your vexation.</p>

<p>I am senseless of your wrath. A touch more rare</p>

<p>Subdues all pangs, all fears.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  Past grace? Obedience?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>Past hope and in despair; that way past grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>O, blessed that I might not! I chose an eagle</p>

<p>And did avoid a puttock.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>Thou took’st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne</p>

<p>A seat for baseness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc>  No, I rather added</p>

<p>A luster to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  O thou vile one!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc>  Sir,</p>

<p>It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus.</p>

<p>You bred him as my playfellow, and he is</p>

<p>A man worth any woman, overbuys me</p>

<p>Almost the sum he pays.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  What, art thou mad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>Almost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were</p>

<p>A neatherd’s daughter, and my Leonatus</p>

<p>Our neighbor shepherd’s son.     <i><i>[She weeps.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  Thou foolish thing!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Queen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>They were again together. You have done</p>

<p>Not after our command. Away with her</p>

<p>And pen her up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Beseech your patience.–Peace,</p>

<p>Dear lady daughter, peace.–Sweet sovereign,</p>

<p>Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some</p>

<p>comfort</p>

<p>Out of your best advice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  Nay, let her languish</p>

<p>A drop of blood a day, and being aged</p>

<p>Die of this folly.     <i><i>[He exits, with Lords.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Fie, you must give way.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pisanio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here is your servant.–How now, sir? What news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc></p>

<p>My lord your son drew on my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Ha?</p>

<p>No harm, I trust, is done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  There might have been,</p>

<p>But that my master rather played than fought</p>

<p>And had no help of anger. They were parted</p>

<p>By gentlemen at hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  I am very glad on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>Your son’s my father’s friend; he takes his part</p>

<p>To draw upon an exile. O, brave sir!</p>

<p>I would they were in Afric both together,</p>

<p>Myself by with a needle, that I might prick</p>

<p>The goer-back.–Why came you from your master?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc></p>

<p>On his command. He would not suffer me</p>

<p>To bring him to the haven, left these notes</p>

<p>Of what commands I should be subject to</p>

<p>When ’t pleased you to employ me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <i>[to Imogen]</i>  This hath been</p>

<p>Your faithful servant. I dare lay mine honor</p>

<p>He will remain so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  I humbly thank your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <i>[to Imogen]</i></p>

<p>Pray, walk awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc> <i>[to Pisanio]</i>  About some half hour hence,</p>

<p>Pray you, speak with me. You shall at least</p>

<p>Go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
