<p><center><i>[Enter Belarius as Morgan, Guiderius as Polydor,</p>

<p>Arviragus as Cadwal, and Imogen as Fidele, from the</p>

<p>cave.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan, to Fidele]</i></p>

<p>You are not well. Remain here in the cave.</p>

<p>We’ll come to you after hunting.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal, to Fidele]</i>  Brother, stay here.</p>

<p>Are we not brothers?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc> <i>[as Fidele]</i>  So man and man should be,</p>

<p>But clay and clay differs in dignity,</p>

<p>Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor, to Morgan and Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>Go you to hunting. I’ll abide with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc> <i>[as Fidele]</i></p>

<p>So sick I am not, yet I am not well;</p>

<p>But not so citizen a wanton as</p>

<p>To seem to die ere sick. So please you, leave me.</p>

<p>Stick to your journal course. The breach of custom</p>

<p>Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me</p>

<p>Cannot amend me. Society is no comfort</p>

<p>To one not sociable. I am not very sick,</p>

<p>Since I can reason of it. Pray you trust me here–</p>

<p>I’ll rob none but myself–and let me die,</p>

<p>Stealing so poorly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>I love thee–I have spoke it–</p>

<p>How much the quantity, the weight as much</p>

<p>As I do love my father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  What? How, how?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me</p>

<p>In my good brother’s fault. I know not why</p>

<p>I love this youth, and I have heard you say</p>

<p>Love’s reason’s without reason. The bier at door,</p>

<p>And a demand who is ’t shall die, I’d say</p>

<p>“My father, not this youth.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  O, noble strain!</p>

<p>O, worthiness of nature, breed of greatness!</p>

<p>Cowards father cowards and base things sire base;</p>

<p>Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.</p>

<p>I’m not their father, yet who this should be</p>

<p>Doth miracle itself, loved before me.–</p>

<p>’Tis the ninth hour o’ th’ morn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal, to Fidele]</i>  Brother, farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc> <i>[as Fidele]</i></p>

<p>I wish you sport.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  You health.–So please you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies I have heard!</p>

<p>Our courtiers say all’s savage but at court;</p>

<p>Experience, O, thou disprov’st report!</p>

<p>Th’ imperious seas breeds monsters; for the dish</p>

<p>Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.</p>

<p>I am sick still, heart-sick. Pisanio,</p>

<p>I’ll now taste of thy drug.     <i><i>[She swallows the drug.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor, to Morgan and Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>I could not stir him.</p>

<p>He said he was gentle but unfortunate,</p>

<p>Dishonestly afflicted but yet honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>Thus did he answer me, yet said hereafter</p>

<p>I might know more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  To th’ field, to th’ field!</p>

<p><i>[To Fidele.]</i> We’ll leave you for this time. Go in and</p>

<p>rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>We’ll not be long away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  Pray, be not sick,</p>

<p>For you must be our huswife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc> <i>[as Fidele]</i>  Well or ill,</p>

<p>I am bound to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  And shalt be ever.</p>

<p><center><i>[Imogen exits as into the cave.]</i></center></p>

<p>This youth, howe’er distressed, appears he hath had</p>

<p>Good ancestors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  How angel-like he sings!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>But his neat cookery! He cut our roots in characters</p>

<p>And sauced our broths as Juno had been sick</p>

<p>And he her dieter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  Nobly he yokes</p>

<p>A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh</p>

<p>Was that it was for not being such a smile,</p>

<p>The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly</p>

<p>From so divine a temple to commix</p>

<p>With winds that sailors rail at.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  I do note</p>

<p>That grief and patience, rooted in them both,</p>

<p>Mingle their spurs together.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  Grow, patience,</p>

<p>And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine</p>

<p>His perishing root with the increasing vine!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i></p>

<p>It is great morning. Come, away. Who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cloten.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc> <i>[to himself]</i></p>

<p>I cannot find those runagates. That villain</p>

<p>Hath mocked me. I am faint.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan, to Polydor and Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>“Those runagates”?</p>

<p>Means he not us? I partly know him. ’Tis</p>

<p>Cloten, the son o’ th’ Queen. I fear some ambush.</p>

<p>I saw him not these many years, and yet</p>

<p>I know ’tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>He is but one. You and my brother search</p>

<p>What companies are near. Pray you, away.</p>

<p>Let me alone with him.     <i><i>[Belarius and Arviragus exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Soft, what are you</p>

<p>That fly me thus? Some villain mountaineers?</p>

<p>I have heard of such.–What slave art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  A thing</p>

<p>More slavish did I ne’er than answering</p>

<p>A slave without a knock.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Thou art a robber,</p>

<p>A lawbreaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I</p>

<p>An arm as big as thine? A heart as big?</p>

<p>Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not</p>

<p>My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,</p>

<p>Why I should yield to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Thou villain base,</p>

<p>Know’st me not by my clothes?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  No, nor thy tailor,</p>

<p>rascal.</p>

<p>Who is thy grandfather? He made those clothes,</p>

<p>Which, as it seems, make thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Thou precious varlet,</p>

<p>My tailor made them not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  Hence then, and thank</p>

<p>The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool.</p>

<p>I am loath to beat thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Thou injurious thief,</p>

<p>Hear but my name, and tremble.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  What’s thy name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Cloten, thou villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,</p>

<p>I cannot tremble at it. Were it Toad, or Adder, Spider,</p>

<p>’Twould move me sooner.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  To thy further fear,</p>

<p>Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know</p>

<p>I am son to th’ Queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  I am sorry for ’t, not seeming</p>

<p>So worthy as thy birth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Art not afeard?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>Those that I reverence, those I fear–the wise;</p>

<p>At fools I laugh, not fear them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Die the death!</p>

<p>When I have slain thee with my proper hand,</p>

<p>I’ll follow those that even now fled hence</p>

<p>And on the gates of Lud’s Town set your heads.</p>

<p>Yield, rustic mountaineer!</p>

<p><center><i>[They fight and exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Belarius as Morgan and Arviragus as</p>

<p>Cadwal.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  No company’s abroad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>None in the world. You did mistake him sure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i></p>

<p>I cannot tell. Long is it since I saw him,</p>

<p>But time hath nothing blurred those lines of favor</p>

<p>Which then he wore. The snatches in his voice</p>

<p>And burst of speaking were as his. I am absolute</p>

<p>’Twas very Cloten.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  In this place we left them.</p>

<p>I wish my brother make good time with him,</p>

<p>You say he is so fell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  Being scarce made up,</p>

<p>I mean to man, he had not apprehension</p>

<p>Of roaring terrors; for defect of judgment</p>

<p>Is oft the cause of fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Guiderius as Polydor, carrying Cloten’s head.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But see, thy brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;</p>

<p>There was no money in ’t. Not Hercules</p>

<p>Could have knocked out his brains, for he had none.</p>

<p>Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne</p>

<p>My head as I do his.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  What hast thou done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten’s head,</p>

<p>Son to the Queen, after his own report,</p>

<p>Who called me traitor mountaineer, and swore</p>

<p>With his own single hand he’d take us in,</p>

<p>Displace our heads where, thank the gods, they</p>

<p>grow,</p>

<p>And set them on Lud’s Town.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  We are all undone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>Why, worthy father, what have we to lose</p>

<p>But that he swore to take, our lives? The law</p>

<p>Protects not us. Then why should we be tender</p>

<p>To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,</p>

<p>Play judge and executioner all himself,</p>

<p>For we do fear the law? What company</p>

<p>Discover you abroad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  No single soul</p>

<p>Can we set eye on, but in all safe reason</p>

<p>He must have some attendants. Though his humor</p>

<p>Was nothing but mutation–ay, and that</p>

<p>From one bad thing to worse–not frenzy,</p>

<p>Not absolute madness could so far have raved</p>

<p>To bring him here alone. Although perhaps</p>

<p>It may be heard at court that such as we</p>

<p>Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time</p>

<p>May make some stronger head, the which he</p>

<p>hearing–</p>

<p>As it is like him–might break out and swear</p>

<p>He’d fetch us in, yet is ’t not probable</p>

<p>To come alone, either he so undertaking</p>

<p>Or they so suffering. Then on good ground we fear,</p>

<p>If we do fear this body hath a tail</p>

<p>More perilous than the head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  Let ord’nance</p>

<p>Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe’er,</p>

<p>My brother hath done well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  I had no mind</p>

<p>To hunt this day. The boy Fidele’s sickness</p>

<p>Did make my way long forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  With his own sword,</p>

<p>Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta’en</p>

<p>His head from him. I’ll throw ’t into the creek</p>

<p>Behind our rock, and let it to the sea</p>

<p>And tell the fishes he’s the Queen’s son, Cloten.</p>

<p>That’s all I reck.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  I fear ’twill be revenged.</p>

<p>Would, Polydor, thou hadst not done ’t, though valor</p>

<p>Becomes thee well enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  Would I had done ’t,</p>

<p>So the revenge alone pursued me. Polydor,</p>

<p>I love thee brotherly, but envy much</p>

<p>Thou hast robbed me of this deed. I would revenges</p>

<p>That possible strength might meet would seek us</p>

<p>through</p>

<p>And put us to our answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  Well, ’tis done.</p>

<p>We’ll hunt no more today, nor seek for danger</p>

<p>Where there’s no profit. I prithee, to our rock.</p>

<p>You and Fidele play the cooks. I’ll stay</p>

<p>Till hasty Polydor return, and bring him</p>

<p>To dinner presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  Poor sick Fidele.</p>

<p>I’ll willingly to him. To gain his color</p>

<p>I’d let a parish of such Clotens blood,</p>

<p>And praise myself for charity.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc>  O thou goddess,</p>

<p>Thou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon’st</p>

<p>In these two princely boys! They are as gentle</p>

<p>As zephyrs blowing below the violet,</p>

<p>Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,</p>

<p>Their royal blood enchafed, as the rud’st wind</p>

<p>That by the top doth take the mountain pine</p>

<p>And make him stoop to th’ vale. ’Tis wonder</p>

<p>That an invisible instinct should frame them</p>

<p>To royalty unlearned, honor untaught,</p>

<p>Civility not seen from other, valor</p>

<p>That wildly grows in them but yields a crop</p>

<p>As if it had been sowed. Yet still it’s strange</p>

<p>What Cloten’s being here to us portends,</p>

<p>Or what his death will bring us.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Guiderius as Polydor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  Where’s my brother?</p>

<p>I have sent Cloten’s clotpole down the stream</p>

<p>In embassy to his mother. His body’s hostage</p>

<p>For his return.     <i><i>[Solemn music.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  My ingenious instrument!</p>

<p>Hark, Polydor, it sounds! But what occasion</p>

<p>Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>Is he at home?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  He went hence even now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>What does he mean? Since death of my dear’st</p>

<p>mother</p>

<p>It did not speak before. All solemn things</p>

<p>Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?</p>

<p>Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys</p>

<p>Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.</p>

<p>Is Cadwal mad?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Arviragus as Cadwal, with Imogen as dead,</p>

<p>bearing her in his arms.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  Look, here he comes,</p>

<p>And brings the dire occasion in his arms</p>

<p>Of what we blame him for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  The bird is dead</p>

<p>That we have made so much on. I had rather</p>

<p>Have skipped from sixteen years of age to sixty,</p>

<p>To have turned my leaping time into a crutch,</p>

<p>Than have seen this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  O sweetest, fairest lily!</p>

<p>My brother wears thee not the one half so well</p>

<p>As when thou grew’st thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  O melancholy,</p>

<p>Whoever yet could sound thy bottom, find</p>

<p>The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare</p>

<p>Might eas’liest harbor in?–Thou blessed thing,</p>

<p>Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,</p>

<p>Thou died’st, a most rare boy, of melancholy.–</p>

<p>How found you him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  Stark, as you see;</p>

<p>Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,</p>

<p>Not as Death’s dart being laughed at; his right cheek</p>

<p>Reposing on a cushion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  Where?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  O’ th’ floor,</p>

<p>His arms thus leagued. I thought he slept, and put</p>

<p>My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness</p>

<p>Answered my steps too loud.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  Why, he but sleeps.</p>

<p>If he be gone, he’ll make his grave a bed;</p>

<p>With female fairies will his tomb be haunted–</p>

<p>And worms will not come to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  With fairest flowers,</p>

<p>Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,</p>

<p>I’ll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack</p>

<p>The flower that’s like thy face, pale primrose; nor</p>

<p>The azured harebell, like thy veins; no, nor</p>

<p>The leaf of eglantine whom, not to slander,</p>

<p>Out-sweetened not thy breath. The ruddock would</p>

<p>With charitable bill–O bill, sore shaming</p>

<p>Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie</p>

<p>Without a monument–bring thee all this,</p>

<p>Yea, and furred moss besides, when flowers are none</p>

<p>To winter-ground thy corse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  Prithee, have done,</p>

<p>And do not play in wench-like words with that</p>

<p>Which is so serious. Let us bury him</p>

<p>And not protract with admiration what</p>

<p>Is now due debt. To th’ grave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  Say, where shall ’s lay</p>

<p>him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>By good Euriphile, our mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  Be ’t so.</p>

<p>And let us, Polydor, though now our voices</p>

<p>Have got the mannish crack, sing him to th’ ground</p>

<p>As once to our mother; use like note and words,</p>

<p>Save that “Euriphile” must be “Fidele.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  Cadwal,</p>

<p>I cannot sing. I’ll weep, and word it with thee,</p>

<p>For notes of sorrow, out of tune, are worse</p>

<p>Than priests and fanes that lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  We’ll speak it then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i></p>

<p>Great griefs, I see, med’cine the less, for Cloten</p>

<p>Is quite forgot. He was a queen’s son, boys,</p>

<p>And though he came our enemy, remember</p>

<p>He was paid for that. Though mean and mighty,</p>

<p>Rotting together, have one dust, yet reverence,</p>

<p>That angel of the world, doth make distinction</p>

<p>Of place ’tween high and low. Our foe was princely,</p>

<p>And though you took his life as being our foe,</p>

<p>Yet bury him as a prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor, to Morgan]</i>  Pray you fetch him</p>

<p>hither.</p>

<p>Thersites’ body is as good as Ajax’</p>

<p>When neither are alive.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal, to Morgan]</i>  If you’ll go fetch</p>

<p>him,</p>

<p>We’ll say our song the whilst.–Brother, begin.</p>

<p><center><i>[Belarius exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th’ east;</p>

<p>My father hath a reason for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  ’Tis true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>Come on then, and remove him.</p>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  So, begin.</p>

<br/>

<p>Song.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fear no more the heat o’ th’ sun,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Nor the furious winter’s rages;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Thou thy worldly task hast done,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Home art gone and ta’en thy wages.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Golden lads and girls all must,</i></p>

<p>     <i>As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fear no more the frown o’ th’ great;</i></p>

<p>        <i>Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Care no more to clothe and eat;</i></p>

<p>        <i>To thee the reed is as the oak.</i></p>

<p>     <i>The scepter, learning, physic must</i></p>

<p>     <i>All follow this and come to dust.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fear no more the lightning flash.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>        <i>Nor th’ all-dreaded thunderstone.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fear not slander, censure rash;</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>        <i>Thou hast finished joy and moan.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>     <i>All lovers young, all lovers must</i></p>

<p>     <i>Consign to thee and come to dust.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>     <i>No exorciser harm thee,</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Nor no witchcraft charm thee.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Ghost unlaid forbear thee.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arviragus</sc> <i>[as Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Nothing ill come near thee.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>     <i>Quiet consummation have,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And renowned be thy grave.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Belarius as Morgan, with the body of Cloten.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guiderius</sc> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cloten’s body is placed by Imogen’s.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Belarius</sc> <i>[as Morgan]</i></p>

<p>Here’s a few flowers, but ’bout midnight more.</p>

<p>The herbs that have on them cold dew o’ th’ night</p>

<p>Are strewings fitt’st for graves. Upon their faces.–</p>

<p>You were as flowers, now withered. Even so</p>

<p>These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.–</p>

<p>Come on, away; apart upon our knees.</p>

<p>The ground that gave them first has them again.</p>

<p>Their pleasures here are past; so is their pain.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Imogen awakes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>Yes, sir, to Milford Haven. Which is the way?</p>

<p>I thank you. By yond bush? Pray, how far thither?</p>

<p>Ods pittikins, can it be six mile yet?</p>

<p>I have gone all night. Faith, I’ll lie down and sleep.</p>

<p><center><i>[She sees Cloten’s headless body.]</i></center></p>

<p>But soft! No bedfellow? O gods and goddesses!</p>

<p>These flowers are like the pleasures of the world,</p>

<p>This bloody man the care on ’t. I hope I dream,</p>

<p>For so I thought I was a cave-keeper</p>

<p>And cook to honest creatures. But ’tis not so.</p>

<p>’Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,</p>

<p>Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes</p>

<p>Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,</p>

<p>I tremble still with fear; but if there be</p>

<p>Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity</p>

<p>As a wren’s eye, feared gods, a part of it!</p>

<p>The dream’s here still. Even when I wake it is</p>

<p>Without me as within me, not imagined, felt.</p>

<p>A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?</p>

<p>I know the shape of ’s leg. This is his hand,</p>

<p>His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh,</p>

<p>The brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face–</p>

<p>Murder in heaven! How? ’Tis gone. Pisanio,</p>

<p>All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,</p>

<p>And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,</p>

<p>Conspired with that irregulous devil Cloten,</p>

<p>Hath here cut off my lord. To write and read</p>

<p>Be henceforth treacherous. Damned Pisanio</p>

<p>Hath with his forged letters–damned Pisanio–</p>

<p>From this most bravest vessel of the world</p>

<p>Struck the maintop. O Posthumus, alas,</p>

<p>Where is thy head? Where’s that? Ay me, where’s that?</p>

<p>Pisanio might have killed thee at the heart</p>

<p>And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?</p>

<p>’Tis he and Cloten. Malice and lucre in them</p>

<p>Have laid this woe here. O, ’tis pregnant, pregnant!</p>

<p>The drug he gave me, which he said was precious</p>

<p>And cordial to me, have I not found it</p>

<p>Murd’rous to th’ senses? That confirms it home.</p>

<p>This is Pisanio’s deed, and Cloten. O,</p>

<p>Give color to my pale cheek with thy blood,</p>

<p>That we the horrider may seem to those</p>

<p>Which chance to find us. O my lord! My lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius, Captains, Soldiers, and a Soothsayer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>To them the legions garrisoned in Gallia,</p>

<p>After your will, have crossed the sea, attending</p>

<p>You here at Milford Haven with your ships.</p>

<p>They are here in readiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  But what from Rome?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>The Senate hath stirred up the confiners</p>

<p>And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits</p>

<p>That promise noble service, and they come</p>

<p>Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,</p>

<p>Siena’s brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  When expect you them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>With the next benefit o’ th’ wind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  This forwardness</p>

<p>Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers</p>

<p>Be mustered; bid the Captains look to ’t.–Now, sir,</p>

<p>What have you dreamed of late of this war’s purpose?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Soothsayer</sc></p>

<p>Last night the very gods showed me a vision–</p>

<p>I fast and prayed for their intelligence–thus:</p>

<p>I saw Jove’s bird, the Roman eagle, winged</p>

<p>From the spongy south to this part of the west,</p>

<p>There vanished in the sunbeams, which portends–</p>

<p>Unless my sins abuse my divination–</p>

<p>Success to th’ Roman host.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  Dream often so,</p>

<p>And never false.–Soft, ho, what trunk is here</p>

<p>Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime</p>

<p>It was a worthy building. How, a page?</p>

<p>Or dead or sleeping on him? But dead rather,</p>

<p>For nature doth abhor to make his bed</p>

<p>With the defunct or sleep upon the dead.</p>

<p>Let’s see the boy’s face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc>  He’s alive, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>He’ll then instruct us of this body.–Young one,</p>

<p>Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems</p>

<p>They crave to be demanded. Who is this</p>

<p>Thou mak’st thy bloody pillow? Or who was he</p>

<p>That, otherwise than noble nature did,</p>

<p>Hath altered that good picture? What’s thy interest</p>

<p>In this sad wrack? How came ’t? Who is ’t?</p>

<p>What art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc> <i>[as Fidele]</i>  I am nothing; or if not,</p>

<p>Nothing to be were better. This was my master,</p>

<p>A very valiant Briton, and a good,</p>

<p>That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas,</p>

<p>There is no more such masters. I may wander</p>

<p>From east to occident, cry out for service,</p>

<p>Try many, all good, serve truly, never</p>

<p>Find such another master.</p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  ’Lack, good youth,</p>

<p>Thou mov’st no less with thy complaining than</p>

<p>Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc> <i>[as Fidele]</i></p>

<p>Richard du Champ. <i>[Aside.]</i> If I do lie and do</p>

<p>No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope</p>

<p>They’ll pardon it.–Say you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  Thy name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc> <i>[as Fidele]</i>  Fidele, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Thou dost approve thyself the very same;</p>

<p>Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.</p>

<p>Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say</p>

<p>Thou shalt be so well mastered, but be sure</p>

<p>No less beloved. The Roman Emperor’s letters</p>

<p>Sent by a consul to me should not sooner</p>

<p>Than thine own worth prefer thee. Go with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc> <i>[as Fidele]</i></p>

<p>I’ll follow, sir. But first, an ’t please the gods,</p>

<p>I’ll hide my master from the flies as deep</p>

<p>As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when</p>

<p>With wild-wood leaves and weeds I ha’ strewed his</p>

<p>grave</p>

<p>And on it said a century of prayers,</p>

<p>Such as I can, twice o’er, I’ll weep and sigh,</p>

<p>And leaving so his service, follow you,</p>

<p>So please you entertain me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  Ay, good youth,</p>

<p>And rather father thee than master thee.–My friends,</p>

<p>The boy hath taught us manly duties. Let us</p>

<p>Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,</p>

<p>And make him with our pikes and partisans</p>

<p>A grave. Come, arm him.–Boy, he’s preferred</p>

<p>By thee to us, and he shall be interred</p>

<p>As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes.</p>

<p>Some falls are means the happier to arise.</p>
