<p><center><i>[Enter Philario, Iachimo, a Frenchman, a Dutchman,</p>

<p>and a Spaniard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He</p>

<p>was then of a crescent note, expected to prove so</p>

<p>worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of.</p>

<p>But I could then have looked on him without the</p>

<p>help of admiration, though the catalogue of his</p>

<p>endowments had been tabled by his side and I to</p>

<p>peruse him by items.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span>  You speak of him when he was less furnished</p>

<p>than now he is with that which makes him</p>

<p>both without and within.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Frenchman</span>  I have seen him in France. We had very</p>

<p>many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes</p>

<p>as he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  This matter of marrying his king’s daughter,</p>

<p>wherein he must be weighed rather by her value</p>

<p>than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal</p>

<p>from the matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Frenchman</span>  And then his banishment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Ay, and the approbation of those that weep</p>

<p>this lamentable divorce under her colors are wonderfully</p>

<p>to extend him, be it but to fortify her judgment,</p>

<p>which else an easy battery might lay flat for</p>

<p>taking a beggar without less quality.–But how</p>

<p>comes it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps</p>

<p>acquaintance?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span>  His father and I were soldiers together, to</p>

<p>whom I have been often bound for no less than my</p>

<p>life.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Posthumus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained</p>

<p>amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your knowing,</p>

<p>to a stranger of his quality.–I beseech you all,</p>

<p>be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend</p>

<p>to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy</p>

<p>he is I will leave to appear hereafter rather</p>

<p>than story him in his own hearing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Frenchman</span> <i>[to Posthumus]</i>  Sir, we have known together</p>

<p>in Orleans.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Since when I have been debtor to you for</p>

<p>courtesies which I will be ever to pay and yet pay</p>

<p>still.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Frenchman</span>  Sir, you o’errate my poor kindness. I was</p>

<p>glad I did atone my countryman and you. It had</p>

<p>been pity you should have been put together with</p>

<p>so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance</p>

<p>of so slight and trivial a nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  By your pardon, sir, I was then a young</p>

<p>traveler, rather shunned to go even with what I</p>

<p>heard than in my every action to be guided by others’</p>

<p>experiences. But upon my mended judgment–</p>

<p>if I offend not to say it is mended–my</p>

<p>quarrel was not altogether slight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Frenchman</span>  Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrament of</p>

<p>swords, and by such two that would by all likelihood</p>

<p>have confounded one the other or have fall’n</p>

<p>both.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Can we with manners ask what was the</p>

<p>difference?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Frenchman</span>  Safely, I think. ’Twas a contention in public,</p>

<p>which may without contradiction suffer the report.</p>

<p>It was much like an argument that fell out</p>

<p>last night, where each of us fell in praise of our</p>

<p>country mistresses, this gentleman at that time</p>

<p>vouching–and upon warrant of bloody affirmation–</p>

<p>his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste,</p>

<p>constant, qualified, and less attemptable than any</p>

<p>the rarest of our ladies in France.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  That lady is not now living, or this gentleman’s</p>

<p>opinion by this worn out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  You must not so far prefer her ’fore ours of</p>

<p>Italy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Being so far provoked as I was in France,</p>

<p>I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself</p>

<p>her adorer, not her friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  As fair and as good–a kind of hand-in-hand</p>

<p>comparison–had been something too fair and too</p>

<p>good for any lady in Britain. If she went before</p>

<p>others I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlusters</p>

<p>many I have beheld, I could not but</p>

<p>believe she excelled many. But I have not seen the</p>

<p>most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  I praised her as I rated her. So do I my</p>

<p>stone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  What do you esteem it at?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  More than the world enjoys.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or</p>

<p>she’s outprized by a trifle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  You are mistaken. The one may be sold or</p>

<p>given, or if there were wealth enough for the purchase</p>

<p>or merit for the gift. The other is not a thing</p>

<p>for sale, and only the gift of the gods.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Which the gods have given you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Which, by their graces, I will keep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  You may wear her in title yours, but you</p>

<p>know strange fowl light upon neighboring ponds.</p>

<p>Your ring may be stolen too. So your brace of unprizable</p>

<p>estimations, the one is but frail and the</p>

<p>other casual. A cunning thief or a that-way-accomplished</p>

<p>courtier would hazard the winning both of</p>

<p>first and last.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Your Italy contains none so accomplished</p>

<p>a courtier to convince the honor of my mistress, if</p>

<p>in the holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I</p>

<p>do nothing doubt you have store of thieves;</p>

<p>notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span>  Let us leave here, gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior,</p>

<p>I thank him, makes no stranger of me. We are</p>

<p>familiar at first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  With five times so much conversation I</p>

<p>should get ground of your fair mistress, make her</p>

<p>go back even to the yielding, had I admittance and</p>

<p>opportunity to friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  No, no.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my</p>

<p>estate to your ring, which in my opinion o’ervalues</p>

<p>it something. But I make my wager rather against</p>

<p>your confidence than her reputation, and, to bar</p>

<p>your offense herein too, I durst attempt it against</p>

<p>any lady in the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  You are a great deal abused in too bold a</p>

<p>persuasion, and I doubt not you sustain what</p>

<p>you’re worthy of by your attempt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  What’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  A repulse–though your attempt, as you</p>

<p>call it, deserve more: a punishment, too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span>  Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too</p>

<p>suddenly. Let it die as it was born, and, I pray you,</p>

<p>be better acquainted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Would I had put my estate and my neighbor’s</p>

<p>on th’ approbation of what I have spoke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  What lady would you choose to assail?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Yours, whom in constancy you think stands</p>

<p>so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your</p>

<p>ring that, commend me to the court where your</p>

<p>lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity</p>

<p>of a second conference, and I will bring from</p>

<p>thence that honor of hers which you imagine so</p>

<p>reserved.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  I will wage against your gold, gold to it.</p>

<p>My ring I hold dear as my finger; ’tis part of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you</p>

<p>buy ladies’ flesh at a million a dram, you cannot</p>

<p>preserve it from tainting. But I see you have some</p>

<p>religion in you, that you fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  This is but a custom in your tongue. You</p>

<p>bear a graver purpose, I hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  I am the master of my speeches and would</p>

<p>undergo what’s spoken, I swear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till</p>

<p>your return. Let there be covenants drawn between</p>

<p>’s. My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness</p>

<p>of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to this</p>

<p>match. Here’s my ring.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span>  I will have it no lay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  By the gods, it is one!–If I bring you no sufficient</p>

<p>testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest</p>

<p>bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand</p>

<p>ducats are yours; so is your diamond too. If I come</p>

<p>off and leave her in such honor as you have trust</p>

<p>in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are</p>

<p>yours, provided I have your commendation for my</p>

<p>more free entertainment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  I embrace these conditions. Let us have</p>

<p>articles betwixt us. Only thus far you shall answer:</p>

<p>if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly</p>

<p>to understand you have prevailed, I am no</p>

<p>further your enemy; she is not worth our debate. If</p>

<p>she remain unseduced, you not making it appear</p>

<p>otherwise, for your ill opinion and th’ assault you</p>

<p>have made to her chastity, you shall answer me</p>

<p>with your sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Your hand; a covenant.     <i><i>[(They shake hands.)]</i></i></p>

<p>We will have these things set down by lawful counsel,</p>

<p>and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain</p>

<p>should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold</p>

<p>and have our two wagers recorded.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Agreed.     <i><i>[Iachimo and Posthumus exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Frenchman</span>  Will this hold, think you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span>  Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray, let us</p>

<p>follow ’em.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
