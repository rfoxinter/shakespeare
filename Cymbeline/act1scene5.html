<p><center><i>[Enter Queen, Ladies, and Cornelius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Whiles yet the dew’s on ground, gather those flowers.</p>

<p>Make haste. Who has the note of them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc>  I, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Dispatch.     <i><i>[Ladies exit.]</i></i></p>

<p>Now, Master Doctor, have you brought those drugs?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornelius</sc></p>

<p>Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands her a small box.]</i></center></p>

<p>But I beseech your Grace, without offense–</p>

<p>My conscience bids me ask–wherefore you have</p>

<p>Commanded of me these most poisonous</p>

<p>compounds,</p>

<p>Which are the movers of a languishing death,</p>

<p>But though slow, deadly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  I wonder, doctor,</p>

<p>Thou ask’st me such a question. Have I not been</p>

<p>Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learned me how</p>

<p>To make perfumes, distil, preserve–yea, so</p>

<p>That our great king himself doth woo me oft</p>

<p>For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,</p>

<p>Unless thou think’st me devilish, is ’t not meet</p>

<p>That I did amplify my judgment in</p>

<p>Other conclusions? I will try the forces</p>

<p>Of these thy compounds on such creatures as</p>

<p>We count not worth the hanging–but none human–</p>

<p>To try the vigor of them and apply</p>

<p>Allayments to their act, and by them gather</p>

<p>Their several virtues and effects.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornelius</sc>  Your Highness</p>

<p>Shall from this practice but make hard your heart.</p>

<p>Besides, the seeing these effects will be</p>

<p>Both noisome and infectious.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  O, content thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pisanio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> Here comes a flattering rascal. Upon him</p>

<p>Will I first work. He’s for his master</p>

<p>And enemy to my son.–How now, Pisanio?–</p>

<p>Doctor, your service for this time is ended.</p>

<p>Take your own way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornelius</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  I do suspect you, madam,</p>

<p>But you shall do no harm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <i>[to Pisanio]</i>  Hark thee, a word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornelius</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I do not like her. She doth think she has</p>

<p>Strange ling’ring poisons. I do know her spirit,</p>

<p>And will not trust one of her malice with</p>

<p>A drug of such damned nature. Those she has</p>

<p>Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,</p>

<p>Which first perchance she’ll prove on cats and dogs,</p>

<p>Then afterward up higher. But there is</p>

<p>No danger in what show of death it makes,</p>

<p>More than the locking-up the spirits a time,</p>

<p>To be more fresh, reviving. She is fooled</p>

<p>With a most false effect, and I the truer</p>

<p>So to be false with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  No further service, doctor,</p>

<p>Until I send for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornelius</sc>  I humbly take my leave.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Weeps she still, sayst thou? Dost thou think in time</p>

<p>She will not quench and let instructions enter</p>

<p>Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.</p>

<p>When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,</p>

<p>I’ll tell thee on the instant thou art then</p>

<p>As great as is thy master; greater, for</p>

<p>His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name</p>

<p>Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor</p>

<p>Continue where he is. To shift his being</p>

<p>Is to exchange one misery with another,</p>

<p>And every day that comes comes to decay</p>

<p>A day’s work in him. What shalt thou expect,</p>

<p>To be depender on a thing that leans,</p>

<p>Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends</p>

<p>So much as but to prop him? <i>[(She drops the box</p>

<p>and Pisanio picks it up.)]</i> Thou tak’st up</p>

<p>Thou know’st not what. But take it for thy labor.</p>

<p>It is a thing I made which hath the King</p>

<p>Five times redeemed from death. I do not know</p>

<p>What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee, take it.</p>

<p>It is an earnest of a farther good</p>

<p>That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how</p>

<p>The case stands with her. Do ’t as from thyself.</p>

<p>Think what a chance thou changest on, but think</p>

<p>Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,</p>

<p>Who shall take notice of thee. I’ll move the King</p>

<p>To any shape of thy preferment such</p>

<p>As thou ’lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,</p>

<p>That set thee on to this desert, am bound</p>

<p>To load thy merit richly. Call my women.</p>

<p>Think on my words.     <i><i>[Pisanio exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>A sly and constant knave,</p>

<p>Not to be shaked; the agent for his master</p>

<p>And the remembrancer of her to hold</p>

<p>The handfast to her lord. I have given him that</p>

<p>Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her</p>

<p>Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,</p>

<p>Except she bend her humor, shall be assured</p>

<p>To taste of too.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pisanio and Ladies carrying flowers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><i>[To the Ladies.]</i> So, so. Well done, well done.</p>

<p>The violets, cowslips, and the primroses</p>

<p>Bear to my closet.–Fare thee well, Pisanio.</p>

<p>Think on my words.     <i><i>[Queen and Ladies exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  And shall do.</p>

<p>But when to my good lord I prove untrue,</p>

<p>I’ll choke myself; there’s all I’ll do for you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
