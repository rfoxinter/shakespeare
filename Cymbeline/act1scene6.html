<p><center><i>[Enter Imogen alone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>A father cruel and a stepdame false,</p>

<p>A foolish suitor to a wedded lady</p>

<p>That hath her husband banished. O, that husband,</p>

<p>My supreme crown of grief and those repeated</p>

<p>Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol’n,</p>

<p>As my two brothers, happy; but most miserable</p>

<p>Is the desire that’s glorious. Blessed be those,</p>

<p>How mean soe’er, that have their honest wills,</p>

<p>Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pisanio and Iachimo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span></p>

<p>Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome</p>

<p>Comes from my lord with letters.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Change you,</p>

<p>madam?</p>

<p>The worthy Leonatus is in safety</p>

<p>And greets your Highness dearly.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives her a letter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Thanks, good sir.</p>

<p>You’re kindly welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>All of her that is out of door, most rich!</p>

<p>If she be furnished with a mind so rare,</p>

<p>She is alone th’ Arabian bird, and I</p>

<p>Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend.</p>

<p>Arm me, audacity, from head to foot,</p>

<p>Or like the Parthian I shall flying fight–</p>

<p>Rather, directly fly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[reads:]</i>  He is one of the noblest note, to whose</p>

<p>kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon</p>

<p>him accordingly as you value your trust.</p>

<p>Leonatus.</p>

<p>So far I read aloud.</p>

<p>But even the very middle of my heart</p>

<p>Is warmed by th’ rest and takes it thankfully.–</p>

<p>You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I</p>

<p>Have words to bid you, and shall find it so</p>

<p>In all that I can do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Thanks, fairest lady.–</p>

<p>What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes</p>

<p>To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop</p>

<p>Of sea and land, which can distinguish ’twixt</p>

<p>The fiery orbs above and the twinned stones</p>

<p>Upon the numbered beach, and can we not</p>

<p>Partition make with spectacles so precious</p>

<p>’Twixt fair and foul?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  What makes your admiration?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>It cannot be i’ th’ eye, for apes and monkeys</p>

<p>’Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and</p>

<p>Contemn with mows the other; nor i’ th’ judgment,</p>

<p>For idiots in this case of favor would</p>

<p>Be wisely definite; nor i’ th’ appetite–</p>

<p>Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed</p>

<p>Should make desire vomit emptiness,</p>

<p>Not so allured to feed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>What is the matter, trow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  The cloyed will,</p>

<p>That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub</p>

<p>Both filled and running, ravening first the lamb,</p>

<p>Longs after for the garbage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  What, dear sir,</p>

<p>Thus raps you? Are you well?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Thanks, madam, well.</p>

<p><i>[(To Pisanio.)]</i> Beseech you, sir,</p>

<p>Desire my man’s abode where I did leave him.</p>

<p>He’s strange and peevish.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  I was going, sir,</p>

<p>To give him welcome.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Well, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>Exceeding pleasant. None a stranger there</p>

<p>So merry and so gamesome. He is called</p>

<p>The Briton Reveler.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  When he was here</p>

<p>He did incline to sadness, and ofttimes</p>

<p>Not knowing why.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  I never saw him sad.</p>

<p>There is a Frenchman his companion, one</p>

<p>An eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves</p>

<p>A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces</p>

<p>The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton–</p>

<p>Your lord, I mean–laughs from ’s free lungs, cries “O,</p>

<p>Can my sides hold to think that man who knows</p>

<p>By history, report, or his own proof</p>

<p>What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose</p>

<p>But must be, will ’s free hours languish for</p>

<p>Assured bondage?”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Will my lord say so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter.</p>

<p>It is a recreation to be by</p>

<p>And hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens</p>

<p>know</p>

<p>Some men are much to blame.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Not he, I hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>Not he–but yet heaven’s bounty towards him might</p>

<p>Be used more thankfully. In himself ’tis much;</p>

<p>In you, which I account his, beyond all talents.</p>

<p>Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound</p>

<p>To pity too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  What do you pity, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>Two creatures heartily.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Am I one, sir?</p>

<p>You look on me. What wrack discern you in me</p>

<p>Deserves your pity?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Lamentable! What,</p>

<p>To hide me from the radiant sun and solace</p>

<p>I’ th’ dungeon by a snuff?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  I pray you, sir,</p>

<p>Deliver with more openness your answers</p>

<p>To my demands. Why do you pity me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  That others do–</p>

<p>I was about to say, enjoy your–but</p>

<p>It is an office of the gods to venge it,</p>

<p>Not mine to speak on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  You do seem to know</p>

<p>Something of me or what concerns me. Pray you,</p>

<p>Since doubting things go ill often hurts more</p>

<p>Than to be sure they do–for certainties</p>

<p>Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,</p>

<p>The remedy then born–discover to me</p>

<p>What both you spur and stop.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Had I this cheek</p>

<p>To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,</p>

<p>Whose every touch, would force the feeler’s soul</p>

<p>To th’ oath of loyalty; this object which</p>

<p>Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,</p>

<p>Fixing it only here; should I, damned then,</p>

<p>Slaver with lips as common as the stairs</p>

<p>That mount the Capitol, join gripes with hands</p>

<p>Made hard with hourly falsehood–falsehood as</p>

<p>With labor; then by-peeping in an eye</p>

<p>Base and illustrous as the smoky light</p>

<p>That’s fed with stinking tallow; it were fit</p>

<p>That all the plagues of hell should at one time</p>

<p>Encounter such revolt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  My lord, I fear,</p>

<p>Has forgot Britain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  And himself. Not I,</p>

<p>Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce</p>

<p>The beggary of his change, but ’tis your graces</p>

<p>That from my mutest conscience to my tongue</p>

<p>Charms this report out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Let me hear no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>O dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart</p>

<p>With pity that doth make me sick. A lady</p>

<p>So fair, and fastened to an empery</p>

<p>Would make the great’st king double, to be partnered</p>

<p>With tomboys hired with that self exhibition</p>

<p>Which your own coffers yield, with diseased ventures</p>

<p>That play with all infirmities for gold</p>

<p>Which rottenness can lend nature; such boiled stuff</p>

<p>As well might poison poison. Be revenged,</p>

<p>Or she that bore you was no queen, and you</p>

<p>Recoil from your great stock.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Revenged?</p>

<p>How should I be revenged? If this be true–</p>

<p>As I have such a heart that both mine ears</p>

<p>Must not in haste abuse–if it be true,</p>

<p>How should I be revenged?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Should he make me</p>

<p>Live like Diana’s priest betwixt cold sheets,</p>

<p>Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,</p>

<p>In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.</p>

<p>I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,</p>

<p>More noble than that runagate to your bed,</p>

<p>And will continue fast to your affection,</p>

<p>Still close as sure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  What ho, Pisanio!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>Let me my service tender on your lips.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>Away! I do condemn mine ears that have</p>

<p>So long attended thee. If thou wert honorable,</p>

<p>Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not</p>

<p>For such an end thou seek’st, as base as strange.</p>

<p>Thou wrong’st a gentleman who is as far</p>

<p>From thy report as thou from honor, and</p>

<p>Solicits here a lady that disdains</p>

<p>Thee and the devil alike.–What ho, Pisanio!–</p>

<p>The King my father shall be made acquainted</p>

<p>Of thy assault. If he shall think it fit</p>

<p>A saucy stranger in his court to mart</p>

<p>As in a Romish stew and to expound</p>

<p>His beastly mind to us, he hath a court</p>

<p>He little cares for and a daughter who</p>

<p>He not respects at all.–What ho, Pisanio!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>O happy Leonatus! I may say</p>

<p>The credit that thy lady hath of thee</p>

<p>Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness</p>

<p>Her assured credit.–Blessed live you long,</p>

<p>A lady to the worthiest sir that ever</p>

<p>Country called his; and you his mistress, only</p>

<p>For the most worthiest fit. Give me your pardon.</p>

<p>I have spoke this to know if your affiance</p>

<p>Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord</p>

<p>That which he is, new o’er; and he is one</p>

<p>The truest mannered, such a holy witch</p>

<p>That he enchants societies into him.</p>

<p>Half all men’s hearts are his.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  You make amends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>He sits ’mongst men like a descended god.</p>

<p>He hath a kind of honor sets him off</p>

<p>More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,</p>

<p>Most mighty princess, that I have adventured</p>

<p>To try your taking of a false report, which hath</p>

<p>Honored with confirmation your great judgment</p>

<p>In the election of a sir so rare,</p>

<p>Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him</p>

<p>Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,</p>

<p>Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>All’s well, sir. Take my power i’ th’ court for yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>My humble thanks. I had almost forgot</p>

<p>T’ entreat your Grace but in a small request,</p>

<p>And yet of moment too, for it concerns.</p>

<p>Your lord, myself, and other noble friends</p>

<p>Are partners in the business.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Pray, what is ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>Some dozen Romans of us and your lord–</p>

<p>The best feather of our wing–have mingled sums</p>

<p>To buy a present for the Emperor;</p>

<p>Which I, the factor for the rest, have done</p>

<p>In France. ’Tis plate of rare device and jewels</p>

<p>Of rich and exquisite form, their values great.</p>

<p>And I am something curious, being strange,</p>

<p>To have them in safe stowage. May it please you</p>

<p>To take them in protection?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Willingly;</p>

<p>And pawn mine honor for their safety. Since</p>

<p>My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them</p>

<p>In my bedchamber.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  They are in a trunk</p>

<p>Attended by my men. I will make bold</p>

<p>To send them to you, only for this night.</p>

<p>I must aboard tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  O no, no.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>Yes, I beseech, or I shall short my word</p>

<p>By length’ning my return. From Gallia</p>

<p>I crossed the seas on purpose and on promise</p>

<p>To see your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  I thank you for your pains.</p>

<p>But not away tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  O, I must, madam.</p>

<p>Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please</p>

<p>To greet your lord with writing, do ’t tonight.</p>

<p>I have outstood my time, which is material</p>

<p>To th’ tender of our present.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  I will write.</p>

<p>Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept</p>

<p>And truly yielded you. You’re very welcome.</p>
