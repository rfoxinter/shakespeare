<p><center><i>[Enter Posthumus and Philario.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>Fear it not, sir. I would I were so sure</p>

<p>To win the King as I am bold her honor</p>

<p>Will remain hers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span>  What means do you make to him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>Not any, but abide the change of time,</p>

<p>Quake in the present winter’s state, and wish</p>

<p>That warmer days would come. In these feared</p>

<p>hopes</p>

<p>I barely gratify your love; they failing,</p>

<p>I must die much your debtor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span></p>

<p>Your very goodness and your company</p>

<p>O’erpays all I can do. By this, your king</p>

<p>Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius</p>

<p>Will do ’s commission throughly. And I think</p>

<p>He’ll grant the tribute, send th’ arrearages,</p>

<p>Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance</p>

<p>Is yet fresh in their grief.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  I do believe,</p>

<p>Statist though I am none nor like to be,</p>

<p>That this will prove a war; and you shall hear</p>

<p>The legion now in Gallia sooner landed</p>

<p>In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings</p>

<p>Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen</p>

<p>Are men more ordered than when Julius Caesar</p>

<p>Smiled at their lack of skill but found their courage</p>

<p>Worthy his frowning at. Their discipline,</p>

<p>Now winged with their courages, will make known</p>

<p>To their approvers they are people such</p>

<p>That mend upon the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Iachimo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span>  See, Iachimo!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>The swiftest harts have posted you by land,</p>

<p>And winds of all the corners kissed your sails</p>

<p>To make your vessel nimble.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span>  Welcome, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>I hope the briefness of your answer made</p>

<p>The speediness of your return.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Your lady</p>

<p>Is one of the fairest that I have looked upon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>And therewithal the best, or let her beauty</p>

<p>Look thorough a casement to allure false hearts</p>

<p>And be false with them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span> <i>[handing him a paper]</i>  Here are letters for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>Their tenor good, I trust.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  ’Tis very like.</p>

<p><center><i>[Posthumus reads the letter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span></p>

<p>Was Caius Lucius in the Briton court</p>

<p>When you were there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>He was expected then, but not approached.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  All is well yet.</p>

<p>Sparkles this stone as it was wont, or is ’t not</p>

<p>Too dull for your good wearing?</p>

<p><center><i>[He indicates his ring.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  If I have lost it,</p>

<p>I should have lost the worth of it in gold.</p>

<p>I’ll make a journey twice as far t’ enjoy</p>

<p>A second night of such sweet shortness which</p>

<p>Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>The stone’s too hard to come by.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Not a whit,</p>

<p>Your lady being so easy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Make not, sir,</p>

<p>Your loss your sport. I hope you know that we</p>

<p>Must not continue friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Good sir, we must,</p>

<p>If you keep covenant. Had I not brought</p>

<p>The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant</p>

<p>We were to question farther; but I now</p>

<p>Profess myself the winner of her honor,</p>

<p>Together with your ring, and not the wronger</p>

<p>Of her or you, having proceeded but</p>

<p>By both your wills.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  If you can make ’t apparent</p>

<p>That you have tasted her in bed, my hand</p>

<p>And ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion</p>

<p>You had of her pure honor gains or loses</p>

<p>Your sword or mine, or masterless leave both</p>

<p>To who shall find them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Sir, my circumstances,</p>

<p>Being so near the truth as I will make them,</p>

<p>Must first induce you to believe; whose strength</p>

<p>I will confirm with oath, which I doubt not</p>

<p>You’ll give me leave to spare when you shall find</p>

<p>You need it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  First, her bedchamber–</p>

<p>Where I confess I slept not, but profess</p>

<p>Had that was well worth watching–it was hanged</p>

<p>With tapestry of silk and silver, the story</p>

<p>Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman</p>

<p>And Cydnus swelled above the banks, or for</p>

<p>The press of boats or pride. A piece of work</p>

<p>So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive</p>

<p>In workmanship and value, which I wondered</p>

<p>Could be so rarely and exactly wrought</p>

<p>Since the true life on ’t was–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  This is true,</p>

<p>And this you might have heard of here, by me</p>

<p>Or by some other.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  More particulars</p>

<p>Must justify my knowledge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  So they must,</p>

<p>Or do your honor injury.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  The chimney</p>

<p>Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece</p>

<p>Chaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures</p>

<p>So likely to report themselves; the cutter</p>

<p>Was as another Nature, dumb, outwent her,</p>

<p>Motion and breath left out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  This is a thing</p>

<p>Which you might from relation likewise reap,</p>

<p>Being, as it is, much spoke of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  The roof o’ th’ chamber</p>

<p>With golden cherubins is fretted. Her andirons–</p>

<p>I had forgot them–were two winking Cupids</p>

<p>Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely</p>

<p>Depending on their brands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  This is her honor?</p>

<p>Let it be granted you have seen all this–and praise</p>

<p>Be given to your remembrance–the description</p>

<p>Of what is in her chamber nothing saves</p>

<p>The wager you have laid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Then if you can</p>

<p>Be pale, I beg but leave to air this jewel. See–</p>

<p><center><i>[He shows the bracelet.]</i></center></p>

<p>And now ’tis up again. It must be married</p>

<p>To that your diamond. I’ll keep them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Jove!</p>

<p>Once more let me behold it. Is it that</p>

<p>Which I left with her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Sir, I thank her, that.</p>

<p>She stripped it from her arm. I see her yet.</p>

<p>Her pretty action did outsell her gift</p>

<p>And yet enriched it too. She gave it me</p>

<p>And said she prized it once.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Maybe she plucked it off</p>

<p>To send it me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  She writes so to you, doth she?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>O, no, no, no, ’tis true. Here, take this too.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives Iachimo the ring.]</i></center></p>

<p>It is a basilisk unto mine eye,</p>

<p>Kills me to look on ’t. Let there be no honor</p>

<p>Where there is beauty, truth where semblance, love</p>

<p>Where there’s another man. The vows of women</p>

<p>Of no more bondage be to where they are made</p>

<p>Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.</p>

<p>O, above measure false!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span>  Have patience, sir,</p>

<p>And take your ring again. ’Tis not yet won.</p>

<p>It may be probable she lost it; or</p>

<p>Who knows if one her women, being corrupted,</p>

<p>Hath stol’n it from her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Very true,</p>

<p>And so I hope he came by ’t.–Back, my ring!</p>

<p><center><i>[He takes back the ring.]</i></center></p>

<p>Render to me some corporal sign about her</p>

<p>More evident than this, for this was stol’n.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>Hark you, he swears! By Jupiter he swears.</p>

<p>’Tis true–nay, keep the ring–’tis true.</p>

<p><center><i>[He holds out the ring.]</i></center></p>

<p>I am sure</p>

<p>She would not lose it. Her attendants are</p>

<p>All sworn and honorable. They induced to steal it?</p>

<p>And by a stranger? No, he hath enjoyed her.</p>

<p>The cognizance of her incontinency</p>

<p>Is this. She hath bought the name of whore thus</p>

<p>dearly.</p>

<p>There, take thy hire, and all the fiends of hell</p>

<p>Divide themselves between you!</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives the ring to Iachimo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span>  Sir, be patient.</p>

<p>This is not strong enough to be believed</p>

<p>Of one persuaded well of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Never talk on ’t.</p>

<p>She hath been colted by him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  If you seek</p>

<p>For further satisfying, under her breast,</p>

<p>Worthy the pressing, lies a mole, right proud</p>

<p>Of that most delicate lodging. By my life,</p>

<p>I kissed it, and it gave me present hunger</p>

<p>To feed again, though full. You do remember</p>

<p>This stain upon her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Ay, and it doth confirm</p>

<p>Another stain as big as hell can hold,</p>

<p>Were there no more but it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  Will you hear more?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Spare your arithmetic;</p>

<p>Never count the turns. Once, and a million!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  I’ll be sworn–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  No swearing.</p>

<p>If you will swear you have not done ’t, you lie,</p>

<p>And I will kill thee if thou dost deny</p>

<p>Thou ’st made me cuckold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  I’ll deny nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!</p>

<p>I will go there and do ’t i’ th’ court, before</p>

<p>Her father. I’ll do something.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Philario</span>  Quite beside</p>

<p>The government of patience. You have won.</p>

<p>Let’s follow him and pervert the present wrath</p>

<p>He hath against himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  With all my heart.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
