<p><center><i>[Enter Cymbeline, Belarius as Morgan, Guiderius as</p>

<p>Polydor, Arviragus as Cadwal, Pisanio, Attendants,</p>

<p>and Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span> <i>[to Morgan, Polydor, and Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made</p>

<p>Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart</p>

<p>That the poor soldier that so richly fought,</p>

<p>Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast</p>

<p>Stepped before targes of proof, cannot be found.</p>

<p>He shall be happy that can find him, if</p>

<p>Our grace can make him so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  I never saw</p>

<p>Such noble fury in so poor a thing,</p>

<p>Such precious deeds in one that promised naught</p>

<p>But beggary and poor looks.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  No tidings of him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span></p>

<p>He hath been searched among the dead and living,</p>

<p>But no trace of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span> <i>[to Morgan, Polydor, and Cadwal]</i></p>

<p>To my grief, I am</p>

<p>The heir of his reward, which I will add</p>

<p>To you, the liver, heart, and brain of Britain,</p>

<p>By whom I grant she lives. ’Tis now the time</p>

<p>To ask of whence you are. Report it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  Sir,</p>

<p>In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen.</p>

<p>Further to boast were neither true nor modest,</p>

<p>Unless I add we are honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Bow your knees.</p>

<p><center><i>[They kneel. He taps their shoulders with his sword.]</i></center></p>

<p>Arise my knights o’ th’ battle. I create you</p>

<p>Companions to our person, and will fit you</p>

<p>With dignities becoming your estates.     <i><i>[They rise.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cornelius and Ladies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>There’s business in these faces. Why so sadly</p>

<p>Greet you our victory? You look like Romans,</p>

<p>And not o’ th’ court of Britain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornelius</span>  Hail, great king.</p>

<p>To sour your happiness I must report</p>

<p>The Queen is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Who worse than a physician</p>

<p>Would this report become? But I consider</p>

<p>By med’cine life may be prolonged, yet death</p>

<p>Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornelius</span></p>

<p>With horror, madly dying, like her life,</p>

<p>Which, being cruel to the world, concluded</p>

<p>Most cruel to herself. What she confessed</p>

<p>I will report, so please you. These her women</p>

<p>Can trip me if I err, who with wet cheeks</p>

<p>Were present when she finished.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Prithee, say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornelius</span></p>

<p>First, she confessed she never loved you, only</p>

<p>Affected greatness got by you, not you;</p>

<p>Married your royalty, was wife to your place,</p>

<p>Abhorred your person.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  She alone knew this,</p>

<p>And but she spoke it dying, I would not</p>

<p>Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornelius</span></p>

<p>Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love</p>

<p>With such integrity, she did confess</p>

<p>Was as a scorpion to her sight, whose life,</p>

<p>But that her flight prevented it, she had</p>

<p>Ta’en off by poison.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  O, most delicate fiend!</p>

<p>Who is ’t can read a woman? Is there more?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornelius</span></p>

<p>More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had</p>

<p>For you a mortal mineral which, being took,</p>

<p>Should by the minute feed on life and, ling’ring,</p>

<p>By inches waste you. In which time she purposed,</p>

<p>By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to</p>

<p>O’ercome you with her show and, in time,</p>

<p>When she had fitted you with her craft, to work</p>

<p>Her son into th’ adoption of the crown;</p>

<p>But failing of her end by his strange absence,</p>

<p>Grew shameless desperate; opened, in despite</p>

<p>Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented</p>

<p>The evils she hatched were not effected; so</p>

<p>Despairing died.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Heard you all this, her women?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ladies</span>  We did, so please your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Mine eyes</p>

<p>Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;</p>

<p>Mine ears that heard her flattery; nor my heart,</p>

<p>That thought her like her seeming. It had been vicious</p>

<p>To have mistrusted her. Yet, O my daughter,</p>

<p>That it was folly in me thou mayst say,</p>

<p>And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius, Iachimo, Soothsayer, and other Roman</p>

<p>prisoners, Posthumus Leonatus behind, and Imogen</p>

<p>as Fidele, with Briton Soldiers as guards.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Thou com’st not, Caius, now for tribute. That</p>

<p>The Britons have razed out, though with the loss</p>

<p>Of many a bold one, whose kinsmen have made suit</p>

<p>That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter</p>

<p>Of you their captives, which ourself have granted.</p>

<p>So think of your estate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Consider, sir, the chance of war. The day</p>

<p>Was yours by accident. Had it gone with us,</p>

<p>We should not, when the blood was cool, have</p>

<p>threatened</p>

<p>Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods</p>

<p>Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives</p>

<p>May be called ransom, let it come. Sufficeth</p>

<p>A Roman with a Roman’s heart can suffer.</p>

<p>Augustus lives to think on ’t; and so much</p>

<p>For my peculiar care. This one thing only</p>

<p>I will entreat: my boy, a Briton born,</p>

<p>Let him be ransomed. Never master had</p>

<p>A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,</p>

<p>So tender over his occasions, true,</p>

<p>So feat, so nurselike. Let his virtue join</p>

<p>With my request, which I’ll make bold your Highness</p>

<p>Cannot deny. He hath done no Briton harm,</p>

<p>Though he have served a Roman. Save him, sir,</p>

<p>And spare no blood beside.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  I have surely seen him.</p>

<p>His favor is familiar to me.–Boy,</p>

<p>Thou hast looked thyself into my grace</p>

<p>And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,</p>

<p>To say “Live, boy.” Ne’er thank thy master. Live,</p>

<p>And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,</p>

<p>Fitting my bounty and thy state, I’ll give it,</p>

<p>Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,</p>

<p>The noblest ta’en.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[as Fidele]</i>  I humbly thank your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,</p>

<p>And yet I know thou wilt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[as Fidele]</i>  No, no, alack,</p>

<p>There’s other work in hand. I see a thing</p>

<p>Bitter to me as death. Your life, good master,</p>

<p>Must shuffle for itself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  The boy disdains me,</p>

<p>He leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys</p>

<p>That place them on the truth of girls and boys.</p>

<p>Why stands he so perplexed?</p>

<p><center><i>[Imogen stares at Iachimo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  What would’st thou, boy?</p>

<p>I love thee more and more. Think more and more</p>

<p>What’s best to ask. Know’st him thou look’st on?</p>

<p>Speak.</p>

<p>Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? Thy friend?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[as Fidele]</i></p>

<p>He is a Roman, no more kin to me</p>

<p>Than I to your Highness, who, being born your vassal,</p>

<p>Am something nearer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Wherefore ey’st him so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[as Fidele]</i></p>

<p>I’ll tell you, sir, in private, if you please</p>

<p>To give me hearing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Ay, with all my heart,</p>

<p>And lend my best attention. What’s thy name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[as Fidele]</i></p>

<p>Fidele, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Thou ’rt my good youth, my page.</p>

<p>I’ll be thy master. Walk with me. Speak freely.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cymbeline and Imogen walk aside and talk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span> <i>[as Morgan]</i></p>

<p>Is not this boy revived from death?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arviragus</span> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  One sand another</p>

<p>Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad</p>

<p>Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Guiderius</span> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  The same dead thing alive.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span> <i>[as Morgan]</i></p>

<p>Peace, peace. See further. He eyes us not. Forbear.</p>

<p>Creatures may be alike. Were ’t he, I am sure</p>

<p>He would have spoke to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Guiderius</span> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  But we see him dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span> <i>[as Morgan]</i></p>

<p>Be silent. Let’s see further.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span> <i>[aside]</i>  It is my mistress!</p>

<p>Since she is living, let the time run on</p>

<p>To good or bad.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cymbeline and Imogen come forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span> <i>[to Imogen]</i>  Come, stand thou by our side.</p>

<p>Make thy demand aloud. <i>[(To Iachimo.)]</i> Sir, step</p>

<p>you forth.</p>

<p>Give answer to this boy, and do it freely,</p>

<p>Or by our greatness and the grace of it,</p>

<p>Which is our honor, bitter torture shall</p>

<p>Winnow the truth from falsehood.–On. Speak to</p>

<p>him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[as Fidele, pointing to Iachimo’s hand]</i></p>

<p>My boon is that this gentleman may render</p>

<p>Of whom he had this ring.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span> <i>[aside]</i>  What’s that to him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span></p>

<p>That diamond upon your finger, say</p>

<p>How came it yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>Thou ’lt torture me to leave unspoken that</p>

<p>Which to be spoke would torture thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  How? Me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>I am glad to be constrained to utter that</p>

<p>Which torments me to conceal. By villainy</p>

<p>I got this ring. ’Twas Leonatus’ jewel,</p>

<p>Whom thou didst banish, and–which more may</p>

<p>grieve thee,</p>

<p>As it doth me–a nobler sir ne’er lived</p>

<p>’Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span></p>

<p>All that belongs to this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  That paragon, thy daughter,</p>

<p>For whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits</p>

<p>Quail to remember–Give me leave; I faint.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span></p>

<p>My daughter? What of her? Renew thy strength.</p>

<p>I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will</p>

<p>Than die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>Upon a time–unhappy was the clock</p>

<p>That struck the hour!–it was in Rome–accursed</p>

<p>The mansion where!–’twas at a feast–O, would</p>

<p>Our viands had been poisoned, or at least</p>

<p>Those which I heaved to head!–the good</p>

<p>Posthumus–</p>

<p>What should I say? He was too good to be</p>

<p>Where ill men were, and was the best of all</p>

<p>Amongst the rar’st of good ones–sitting sadly,</p>

<p>Hearing us praise our loves of Italy</p>

<p>For beauty that made barren the swelled boast</p>

<p>Of him that best could speak; for feature, laming</p>

<p>The shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva,</p>

<p>Postures beyond brief nature; for condition,</p>

<p>A shop of all the qualities that man</p>

<p>Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,</p>

<p>Fairness which strikes the eye–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  I stand on fire.</p>

<p>Come to the matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span>  All too soon I shall,</p>

<p>Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,</p>

<p>Most like a noble lord in love and one</p>

<p>That had a royal lover, took his hint,</p>

<p>And, not dispraising whom we praised–therein</p>

<p>He was as calm as virtue–he began</p>

<p>His mistress’ picture; which by his tongue being made</p>

<p>And then a mind put in ’t, either our brags</p>

<p>Were cracked of kitchen trulls, or his description</p>

<p>Proved us unspeaking sots.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Nay, nay, to th’ purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span></p>

<p>Your daughter’s chastity–there it begins.</p>

<p>He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams</p>

<p>And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,</p>

<p>Made scruple of his praise and wagered with him</p>

<p>Pieces of gold ’gainst this, which then he wore</p>

<p>Upon his honored finger, to attain</p>

<p>In suit the place of ’s bed and win this ring</p>

<p>By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,</p>

<p>No lesser of her honor confident</p>

<p>Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring,</p>

<p>And would so, had it been a carbuncle</p>

<p>Of Phoebus’ wheel, and might so safely, had it</p>

<p>Been all the worth of ’s car. Away to Britain</p>

<p>Post I in this design. Well may you, sir,</p>

<p>Remember me at court, where I was taught</p>

<p>Of your chaste daughter the wide difference</p>

<p>’Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quenched</p>

<p>Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain</p>

<p>Gan in your duller Britain operate</p>

<p>Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent.</p>

<p>And to be brief, my practice so prevailed</p>

<p>That I returned with simular proof enough</p>

<p>To make the noble Leonatus mad</p>

<p>By wounding his belief in her renown</p>

<p>With tokens thus and thus; averring notes</p>

<p>Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet–</p>

<p>O, cunning how I got it!–nay, some marks</p>

<p>Of secret on her person, that he could not</p>

<p>But think her bond of chastity quite cracked,</p>

<p>I having ta’en the forfeit. Whereupon–</p>

<p>Methinks I see him now–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span> <i>[coming forward]</i>  Ay, so thou dost,</p>

<p>Italian fiend.–Ay me, most credulous fool,</p>

<p>Egregious murderer, thief, anything</p>

<p>That’s due to all the villains past, in being,</p>

<p>To come. O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,</p>

<p>Some upright justicer.–Thou, king, send out</p>

<p>For torturers ingenious. It is I</p>

<p>That all th’ abhorred things o’ th’ Earth amend</p>

<p>By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,</p>

<p>That killed thy daughter–villainlike, I lie–</p>

<p>That caused a lesser villain than myself,</p>

<p>A sacrilegious thief, to do ’t. The temple</p>

<p>Of virtue was she, yea, and she herself.</p>

<p>Spit and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set</p>

<p>The dogs o’ th’ street to bay me. Every villain</p>

<p>Be called Posthumus Leonatus, and</p>

<p>Be villainy less than ’twas. O Imogen!</p>

<p>My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,</p>

<p>Imogen, Imogen!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[running to Posthumus]</i>  Peace, my lord!</p>

<p>Hear, hear–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>Shall ’s have a play of this? Thou scornful page,</p>

<p>There lie thy part.     <i><i>[He pushes her away; she falls.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  O, gentlemen, help!–</p>

<p>Mine and your mistress! O my lord Posthumus,</p>

<p>You ne’er killed Imogen till now! Help, help!</p>

<p>Mine honored lady–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Does the world go round?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>How comes these staggers on me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  Wake, my mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span></p>

<p>If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me</p>

<p>To death with mortal joy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  How fares my mistress?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  O, get thee from my sight!</p>

<p>Thou gav’st me poison. Dangerous fellow, hence.</p>

<p>Breathe not where princes are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  The tune of Imogen!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span></p>

<p>Lady, the gods throw stones of sulfur on me if</p>

<p>That box I gave you was not thought by me</p>

<p>A precious thing. I had it from the Queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span></p>

<p>New matter still.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  It poisoned me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornelius</span>  O gods!</p>

<p><i>[To Pisanio.]</i> I left out one thing which the Queen</p>

<p>confessed,</p>

<p>Which must approve thee honest. “If Pisanio</p>

<p>Have,” said she, “given his mistress that confection</p>

<p>Which I gave him for cordial, she is served</p>

<p>As I would serve a rat.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  What’s this, Cornelius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornelius</span></p>

<p>The Queen, sir, very oft importuned me</p>

<p>To temper poisons for her, still pretending</p>

<p>The satisfaction of her knowledge only</p>

<p>In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,</p>

<p>Of no esteem. I, dreading that her purpose</p>

<p>Was of more danger, did compound for her</p>

<p>A certain stuff which, being ta’en, would cease</p>

<p>The present power of life, but in short time</p>

<p>All offices of nature should again</p>

<p>Do their due functions.–Have you ta’en of it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>Most like I did, for I was dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span> <i>[as Morgan, aside to Guiderius and Arviragus]</i>  My boys,</p>

<p>There was our error.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Guiderius</span> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  This is sure Fidele.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[to Posthumus]</i></p>

<p>Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?</p>

<p>Think that you are upon a rock, and now</p>

<p>Throw me again.     <i><i>[She embraces him.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Hang there like fruit, my soul,</p>

<p>Till the tree die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span> <i>[to Imogen]</i>  How now, my flesh, my child?</p>

<p>What, mak’st thou me a dullard in this act?</p>

<p>Wilt thou not speak to me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[kneeling]</i>  Your blessing, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span> <i>[as Morgan, aside to Guiderius and Arviragus]</i></p>

<p>Though you did love this youth, I blame you not.</p>

<p>You had a motive for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span> <i>[to Imogen]</i>  My tears that fall</p>

<p>Prove holy water on thee. Imogen,</p>

<p>Thy mother’s dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  I am sorry for ’t, my lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[She rises.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span></p>

<p>O, she was naught, and long of her it was</p>

<p>That we meet here so strangely. But her son</p>

<p>Is gone, we know not how nor where.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  My lord,</p>

<p>Now fear is from me, I’ll speak truth. Lord Cloten,</p>

<p>Upon my lady’s missing, came to me</p>

<p>With his sword drawn, foamed at the mouth, and</p>

<p>swore,</p>

<p>If I discovered not which way she was gone,</p>

<p>It was my instant death. By accident,</p>

<p>I had a feigned letter of my master’s</p>

<p>Then in my pocket, which directed him</p>

<p>To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;</p>

<p>Where, in a frenzy, in my master’s garments,</p>

<p>Which he enforced from me, away he posts</p>

<p>With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate</p>

<p>My lady’s honor. What became of him</p>

<p>I further know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Guiderius</span> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  Let me end the story.</p>

<p>I slew him there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Marry, the gods forfend!</p>

<p>I would not thy good deeds should from my lips</p>

<p>Pluck a hard sentence. Prithee, valiant youth,</p>

<p>Deny ’t again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Guiderius</span> <i>[as Polydor]</i>  I have spoke it, and I did it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  He was a prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Guiderius</span> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me</p>

<p>Were nothing princelike, for he did provoke me</p>

<p>With language that would make me spurn the sea</p>

<p>If it could so roar to me. I cut off ’s head,</p>

<p>And am right glad he is not standing here</p>

<p>To tell this tale of mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  I am sorrow for thee.</p>

<p>By thine own tongue thou art condemned and must</p>

<p>Endure our law. Thou ’rt dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  That headless man</p>

<p>I thought had been my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Bind the offender,</p>

<p>And take him from our presence.</p>

<p><center><i>[Attendants bind Guiderius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  Stay, sir king.</p>

<p>This man is better than the man he slew,</p>

<p>As well descended as thyself, and hath</p>

<p>More of thee merited than a band of Clotens</p>

<p>Had ever scar for.–Let his arms alone.</p>

<p>They were not born for bondage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Why, old soldier,</p>

<p>Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for</p>

<p>By tasting of our wrath? How of descent</p>

<p>As good as we?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arviragus</span> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  In that he spake too far.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span> <i>[to Morgan]</i></p>

<p>And thou shalt die for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  We will die all three</p>

<p>But I will prove that two on ’s are as good</p>

<p>As I have given out him.–My sons, I must</p>

<p>For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech,</p>

<p>Though haply well for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arviragus</span> <i>[as Cadwal]</i>  Your danger’s ours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Guiderius</span> <i>[as Polydor]</i></p>

<p>And our good his.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span> <i>[as Morgan]</i>  Have at it, then.–By leave,</p>

<p>Thou hadst, great king, a subject who</p>

<p>Was called Belarius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  What of him? He is</p>

<p>A banished traitor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span>  He it is that hath</p>

<p>Assumed this age; indeed a banished man,</p>

<p>I know not how a traitor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Take him hence.</p>

<p>The whole world shall not save him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span>  Not too hot.</p>

<p>First pay me for the nursing of thy sons</p>

<p>And let it be confiscate all, so soon</p>

<p>As I have received it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Nursing of my sons?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span></p>

<p>I am too blunt and saucy. Here’s my knee.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>Ere I arise I will prefer my sons,</p>

<p>Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,</p>

<p>These two young gentlemen that call me father</p>

<p>And think they are my sons are none of mine.</p>

<p>They are the issue of your loins, my liege,</p>

<p>And blood of your begetting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  How? My issue?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span></p>

<p>So sure as you your father’s. I, old Morgan,</p>

<p>Am that Belarius whom you sometime banished.</p>

<p>Your pleasure was my mere offense, my punishment</p>

<p>Itself, and all my treason. That I suffered</p>

<p>Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes–</p>

<p>For such and so they are–these twenty years</p>

<p>Have I trained up; those arts they have as I</p>

<p>Could put into them. My breeding was, sir, as</p>

<p>Your Highness knows. Their nurse Euriphile,</p>

<p>Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children</p>

<p>Upon my banishment. I moved her to ’t,</p>

<p>Having received the punishment before</p>

<p>For that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty</p>

<p>Excited me to treason. Their dear loss,</p>

<p>The more of you ’twas felt, the more it shaped</p>

<p>Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,</p>

<p>Here are your sons again, and I must lose</p>

<p>Two of the sweet’st companions in the world.</p>

<p>The benediction of these covering heavens</p>

<p>Fall on their heads like dew, for they are worthy</p>

<p>To inlay heaven with stars.     <i><i>[He weeps.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Thou weep’st and speak’st.</p>

<p>The service that you three have done is more</p>

<p>Unlike than this thou tell’st. I lost my children.</p>

<p>If these be they, I know not how to wish</p>

<p>A pair of worthier sons.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span>  Be pleased awhile.</p>

<p>This gentleman whom I call Polydor,</p>

<p>Most worthy prince, as yours is true Guiderius;</p>

<p>This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,</p>

<p>Your younger princely son. He, sir, was lapped</p>

<p>In a most curious mantle, wrought by th’ hand</p>

<p>Of his queen mother, which for more probation</p>

<p>I can with ease produce.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Guiderius had</p>

<p>Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star.</p>

<p>It was a mark of wonder.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Belarius</span>  This is he,</p>

<p>Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.</p>

<p>It was wise Nature’s end in the donation</p>

<p>To be his evidence now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  O, what am I,</p>

<p>A mother to the birth of three? Ne’er mother</p>

<p>Rejoiced deliverance more.–Blest pray you be,</p>

<p>That after this strange starting from your orbs,</p>

<p>You may reign in them now.–O Imogen,</p>

<p>Thou hast lost by this a kingdom!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  No, my lord.</p>

<p>I have got two worlds by ’t.–O my gentle brothers,</p>

<p>Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter</p>

<p>But I am truest speaker. You called me “brother”</p>

<p>When I was but your sister; I you “brothers”</p>

<p>When we were so indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Did you e’er meet?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arviragus</span></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Guiderius</span>  And at first meeting loved,</p>

<p>Continued so until we thought he died.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornelius</span></p>

<p>By the Queen’s dram she swallowed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span> <i>[to Imogen]</i>  O, rare instinct!</p>

<p>When shall I hear all through? This fierce</p>

<p>abridgment</p>

<p>Hath to it circumstantial branches which</p>

<p>Distinction should be rich in. Where, how lived you?</p>

<p>And when came you to serve our Roman captive?</p>

<p>How parted with your brothers? How first met</p>

<p>them?</p>

<p>Why fled you from the court? And whither?</p>

<p><i>[To Belarius.]</i> These,</p>

<p>And your three motives to the battle, with</p>

<p>I know not how much more, should be demanded,</p>

<p>And all the other by-dependences</p>

<p>From chance to chance; but nor the time nor place</p>

<p>Will serve our long interrogatories. See,</p>

<p>Posthumus anchors upon Imogen;</p>

<p>And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye</p>

<p>On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting</p>

<p>Each object with a joy; the counterchange</p>

<p>Is severally in all. Let’s quit this ground,</p>

<p>And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.</p>

<p>Thou art my brother, so we’ll hold thee ever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[to Belarius]</i></p>

<p>You are my father too, and did relieve me</p>

<p>To see this gracious season.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  All o’erjoyed</p>

<p>Save these in bonds; let them be joyful too,</p>

<p>For they shall taste our comfort.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[to Lucius]</i>  My good master,</p>

<p>I will yet do you service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  Happy be you!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span></p>

<p>The forlorn soldier that so nobly fought,</p>

<p>He would have well becomed this place and graced</p>

<p>The thankings of a king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  I am, sir,</p>

<p>The soldier that did company these three</p>

<p>In poor beseeming; ’twas a fitment for</p>

<p>The purpose I then followed. That I was he,</p>

<p>Speak, Iachimo. I had you down and might</p>

<p>Have made you finish.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iachimo</span> <i>[kneeling]</i>  I am down again,</p>

<p>But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,</p>

<p>As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,</p>

<p>Which I so often owe; but your ring first,</p>

<p>And here the bracelet of the truest princess</p>

<p>That ever swore her faith.</p>

<p><center><i>[He holds out the ring and bracelet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span>  Kneel not to me.</p>

<p>The power that I have on you is to spare you;</p>

<p>The malice towards you to forgive you. Live</p>

<p>And deal with others better.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Nobly doomed.</p>

<p>We’ll learn our freeness of a son-in-law:</p>

<p>Pardon’s the word to all.     <i><i>[Iachimo rises.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Arviragus</span> <i>[to Posthumus]</i>  You holp us, sir,</p>

<p>As you did mean indeed to be our brother.</p>

<p>Joyed are we that you are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>Your servant, princes.–Good my lord of Rome,</p>

<p>Call forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought</p>

<p>Great Jupiter upon his eagle backed</p>

<p>Appeared to me, with other spritely shows</p>

<p>Of mine own kindred. When I waked, I found</p>

<p>This label on my bosom, whose containing</p>

<p>Is so from sense in hardness that I can</p>

<p>Make no collection of it. Let him show</p>

<p>His skill in the construction.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  Philarmonus!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span> <i>[coming forward]</i></p>

<p>Here, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  Read, and declare the meaning.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span> <i>[reads.]</i>  Whenas a lion’s whelp shall, to</p>

<p>himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced</p>

<p>by a piece of tender air; and when from a</p>

<p>stately cedar shall be lopped branches which, being</p>

<p>dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the</p>

<p>old stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus</p>

<p>end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish</p>

<p>in peace and plenty.</p>

<p>Thou, Leonatus, art the lion’s whelp.</p>

<p>The fit and apt construction of thy name,</p>

<p>Being Leo-natus, doth import so much.</p>

<p><i>[To Cymbeline.]</i> The piece of tender air thy virtuous</p>

<p>daughter,</p>

<p>Which we call “mollis aer,” and “mollis aer”</p>

<p>We term it “mulier,” which “mulier” I divine</p>

<p>Is this most constant wife; who, even now,</p>

<p>Answering the letter of the oracle,</p>

<p><i>[To Posthumus]</i> Unknown to you, unsought, were</p>

<p>clipped about</p>

<p>With this most tender air.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  This hath some seeming.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span></p>

<p>The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,</p>

<p>Personates thee; and thy lopped branches point</p>

<p>Thy two sons forth, who, by Belarius stol’n,</p>

<p>For many years thought dead, are now revived,</p>

<p>To the majestic cedar joined, whose issue</p>

<p>Promises Britain peace and plenty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Well,</p>

<p>My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,</p>

<p>Although the victor, we submit to Caesar</p>

<p>And to the Roman Empire, promising</p>

<p>To pay our wonted tribute, from the which</p>

<p>We were dissuaded by our wicked queen,</p>

<p>Whom heavens in justice both on her and hers</p>

<p>Have laid most heavy hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span></p>

<p>The fingers of the powers above do tune</p>

<p>The harmony of this peace. The vision</p>

<p>Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke</p>

<p>Of this yet scarce-cold battle at this instant</p>

<p>Is full accomplished. For the Roman eagle,</p>

<p>From south to west on wing soaring aloft,</p>

<p>Lessened herself and in the beams o’ th’ sun</p>

<p>So vanished; which foreshowed our princely eagle,</p>

<p>Th’ imperial Caesar, should again unite</p>

<p>His favor with the radiant Cymbeline,</p>

<p>Which shines here in the west.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>  Laud we the gods,</p>

<p>And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils</p>

<p>From our blest altars. Publish we this peace</p>

<p>To all our subjects. Set we forward. Let</p>

<p>A Roman and a British ensign wave</p>

<p>Friendly together. So through Lud’s Town march,</p>

<p>And in the temple of great Jupiter</p>

<p>Our peace we’ll ratify, seal it with feasts.</p>

<p>Set on there. Never was a war did cease,</p>

<p>Ere bloody hands were washed, with such a peace.</p>
