<p><center><i>[Enter Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten, Lucius, Lords, and</p>

<p>Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>Thus far, and so farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  Thanks, royal sir.</p>

<p>My emperor hath wrote I must from hence,</p>

<p>And am right sorry that I must report you</p>

<p>My master’s enemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  Our subjects, sir,</p>

<p>Will not endure his yoke, and for ourself</p>

<p>To show less sovereignty than they must needs</p>

<p>Appear unkinglike.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  So, sir. I desire of you</p>

<p>A conduct overland to Milford Haven.–</p>

<p>Madam, all joy befall your Grace–and you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc> <i>[to Lords]</i></p>

<p>My lords, you are appointed for that office.</p>

<p>The due of honor in no point omit.–</p>

<p>So, farewell, noble Lucius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc> <i>[to Cloten]</i>  Your hand, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc></p>

<p>Receive it friendly, but from this time forth</p>

<p>I wear it as your enemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  Sir, the event</p>

<p>Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,</p>

<p>Till he have crossed the Severn. Happiness!</p>

<p><center><i>[Exit Lucius and Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>He goes hence frowning, but it honors us</p>

<p>That we have given him cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  ’Tis all the better.</p>

<p>Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor</p>

<p>How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely</p>

<p>Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness.</p>

<p>The powers that he already hath in Gallia</p>

<p>Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves</p>

<p>His war for Britain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  ’Tis not sleepy business,</p>

<p>But must be looked to speedily and strongly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>Our expectation that it would be thus</p>

<p>Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,</p>

<p>Where is our daughter? She hath not appeared</p>

<p>Before the Roman, nor to us hath tendered</p>

<p>The duty of the day. She looks us like</p>

<p>A thing more made of malice than of duty.</p>

<p>We have noted it.–Call her before us, for</p>

<p>We have been too slight in sufferance.</p>

<p><center><i>[An Attendant exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Royal sir,</p>

<p>Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired</p>

<p>Hath her life been, the cure whereof, my lord,</p>

<p>’Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,</p>

<p>Forbear sharp speeches to her. She’s a lady</p>

<p>So tender of rebukes that words are strokes</p>

<p>And strokes death to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Attendant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  Where is she, sir? How</p>

<p>Can her contempt be answered?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Attendant</sc>  Please you, sir,</p>

<p>Her chambers are all locked, and there’s no answer</p>

<p>That will be given to th’ loud’st noise we make.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>My lord, when last I went to visit her,</p>

<p>She prayed me to excuse her keeping close;</p>

<p>Whereto constrained by her infirmity,</p>

<p>She should that duty leave unpaid to you</p>

<p>Which daily she was bound to proffer. This</p>

<p>She wished me to make known, but our great court</p>

<p>Made me to blame in memory.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  Her doors locked?</p>

<p>Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I</p>

<p>Fear prove false!     <i><i>[He exits with Attendant.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Son, I say, follow the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc></p>

<p>That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant</p>

<p>I have not seen these two days.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Go, look after.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cloten exits.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> Pisanio, thou that stand’st so for Posthumus–</p>

<p>He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence</p>

<p>Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes</p>

<p>It is a thing most precious. But for her,</p>

<p>Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seized her,</p>

<p>Or, winged with fervor of her love, she’s flown</p>

<p>To her desired Posthumus. Gone she is</p>

<p>To death or to dishonor, and my end</p>

<p>Can make good use of either. She being down,</p>

<p>I have the placing of the British crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cloten.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, my son?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  ’Tis certain she is fled.</p>

<p>Go in and cheer the King. He rages; none</p>

<p>Dare come about him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  All the better. May</p>

<p>This night forestall him of the coming day!</p>

<p><center><i>[Queen exits, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc></p>

<p>I love and hate her, for she’s fair and royal,</p>

<p>And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite</p>

<p>Than lady, ladies, woman. From every one</p>

<p>The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,</p>

<p>Outsells them all. I love her therefore, but</p>

<p>Disdaining me and throwing favors on</p>

<p>The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment</p>

<p>That what’s else rare is choked. And in that point</p>

<p>I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,</p>

<p>To be revenged upon her. For, when fools</p>

<p>Shall–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pisanio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?</p>

<p>Come hither. Ah, you precious pander! Villain,</p>

<p>Where is thy lady? In a word, or else</p>

<p>Thou art straightway with the fiends.</p>

<p><center><i>[He draws his sword.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  O, good my lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc></p>

<p>Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter–</p>

<p>I will not ask again. Close villain,</p>

<p>I’ll have this secret from thy heart or rip</p>

<p>Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus,</p>

<p>From whose so many weights of baseness cannot</p>

<p>A dram of worth be drawn?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  Alas, my lord,</p>

<p>How can she be with him? When was she missed?</p>

<p>He is in Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Where is she, sir? Come nearer.</p>

<p>No farther halting. Satisfy me home</p>

<p>What is become of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc></p>

<p>O, my all-worthy lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  All-worthy villain!</p>

<p>Discover where thy mistress is at once,</p>

<p>At the next word. No more of “worthy lord”!</p>

<p>Speak, or thy silence on the instant is</p>

<p>Thy condemnation and thy death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  Then, sir,</p>

<p>This paper is the history of my knowledge</p>

<p>Touching her flight.     <i><i>[He gives Cloten a paper.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Let’s see ’t. I will pursue her</p>

<p>Even to Augustus’ throne.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Or this or perish.</p>

<p>She’s far enough, and what he learns by this</p>

<p>May prove his travail, not her danger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Humh!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I’ll write to my lord she’s dead. O Imogen,</p>

<p>Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Sirrah, is this letter true?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  Sir, as I think.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  It is Posthumus’ hand, I know ’t. Sirrah, if</p>

<p>thou wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,</p>

<p>undergo those employments wherein I should</p>

<p>have cause to use thee with a serious industry–</p>

<p>that is, what villainy soe’er I bid thee do to perform</p>

<p>it directly and truly–I would think thee an honest</p>

<p>man. Thou shouldst neither want my means for thy</p>

<p>relief nor my voice for thy preferment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  Well, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and</p>

<p>constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of</p>

<p>that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not in the</p>

<p>course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of</p>

<p>mine. Wilt thou serve me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  Sir, I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Give me thy hand. Here’s my purse. <i>[Gives</p>

<p>him money.]</i> Hast any of thy late master’s garments</p>

<p>in thy possession?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  I have, my lord, at my lodging the same suit he</p>

<p>wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit</p>

<p>hither. Let it be thy first service. Go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  I shall, my lord.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Meet thee at Milford Haven!–I forgot to ask</p>

<p>him one thing; I’ll remember ’t anon. Even there,</p>

<p>thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would</p>

<p>these garments were come. She said upon a time–</p>

<p>the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart–</p>

<p>that she held the very garment of Posthumus in</p>

<p>more respect than my noble and natural person,</p>

<p>together with the adornment of my qualities. With</p>

<p>that suit upon my back will I ravish her. First, kill</p>

<p>him, and in her eyes. There shall she see my valor,</p>

<p>which will then be a torment to her contempt.</p>

<p>He on the ground, my speech of insultment</p>

<p>ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath</p>

<p>dined–which, as I say, to vex her I will execute</p>

<p>in the clothes that she so praised–to the court</p>

<p>I’ll knock her back, foot her home again. She hath</p>

<p>despised me rejoicingly, and I’ll be merry in my</p>

<p>revenge.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pisanio with the clothes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Be those the garments?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  Ay, my noble lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  How long is ’t since she went to Milford Haven?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  She can scarce be there yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the</p>

<p>second thing that I have commanded thee. The</p>

<p>third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my</p>

<p>design. Be but duteous, and true preferment shall</p>

<p>tender itself to thee. My revenge is now at Milford.</p>

<p>Would I had wings to follow it! Come, and be true.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc></p>

<p>Thou bidd’st me to my loss, for true to thee</p>

<p>Were to prove false, which I will never be,</p>

<p>To him that is most true. To Milford go,</p>

<p>And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,</p>

<p>You heavenly blessings, on her. This fool’s speed</p>

<p>Be crossed with slowness. Labor be his meed.</p>
