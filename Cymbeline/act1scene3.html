<p><center><i>[Enter Imogen and Pisanio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>I would thou grew’st unto the shores o’ th’ haven</p>

<p>And questionedst every sail. If he should write</p>

<p>And I not have it, ’twere a paper lost</p>

<p>As offered mercy is. What was the last</p>

<p>That he spake to thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  It was his queen, his queen!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>Then waved his handkerchief?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  And kissed it, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>Senseless linen, happier therein than I.</p>

<p>And that was all?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  No, madam. For so long</p>

<p>As he could make me with this eye or ear</p>

<p>Distinguish him from others, he did keep</p>

<p>The deck, with glove or hat or handkerchief</p>

<p>Still waving, as the fits and stirs of ’s mind</p>

<p>Could best express how slow his soul sailed on,</p>

<p>How swift his ship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Thou shouldst have made him</p>

<p>As little as a crow, or less, ere left</p>

<p>To after-eye him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  Madam, so I did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>I would have broke mine eyestrings, cracked them,</p>

<p>but</p>

<p>To look upon him till the diminution</p>

<p>Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;</p>

<p>Nay, followed him till he had melted from</p>

<p>The smallness of a gnat to air; and then</p>

<p>Have turned mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,</p>

<p>When shall we hear from him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  Be assured, madam,</p>

<p>With his next vantage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>I did not take my leave of him, but had</p>

<p>Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him</p>

<p>How I would think on him at certain hours</p>

<p>Such thoughts and such; or I could make him swear</p>

<p>The shes of Italy should not betray</p>

<p>Mine interest and his honor; or have charged him</p>

<p>At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight</p>

<p>T’ encounter me with orisons, for then</p>

<p>I am in heaven for him; or ere I could</p>

<p>Give him that parting kiss which I had set</p>

<p>Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father,</p>

<p>And like the tyrannous breathing of the north</p>

<p>Shakes all our buds from growing.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Lady.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span>  The Queen, madam,</p>

<p>Desires your Highness’ company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[to Pisanio]</i></p>

<p>Those things I bid you do, get them dispatched.</p>

<p>I will attend the Queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  Madam, I shall.</p>
