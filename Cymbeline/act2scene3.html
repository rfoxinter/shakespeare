<p><center><i>[Enter Cloten and Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Your Lordship is the most patient man in</p>

<p>loss, the most coldest that ever turned up ace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  It would make any man cold to lose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  But not every man patient after the noble</p>

<p>temper of your Lordship. You are most hot and</p>

<p>furious when you win.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Winning will put any man into courage. If I</p>

<p>could get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold</p>

<p>enough. It’s almost morning, is ’t not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Day, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  I would this music would come. I am advised</p>

<p>to give her music a-mornings; they say it will</p>

<p>penetrate.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Musicians.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Come on, tune. If you can penetrate her with your</p>

<p>fingering, so. We’ll try with tongue, too. If none</p>

<p>will do, let her remain, but I’ll never give o’er. First,</p>

<p>a very excellent good-conceited thing; after, a wonderful</p>

<p>sweet air, with admirable rich words to it,</p>

<p>and then let her consider.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Musicians begin to play.]</i></center></p>

<p>Song.</p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>Hark, hark, the lark at heaven’s gate sings,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And Phoebus gins arise,</i></p>

<p>     <i>His steeds to water at those springs</i></p>

<p>        <i>On chaliced flowers that lies;</i></p>

<p>     <i>And winking Mary-buds begin</i></p>

<p>        <i>To ope their golden eyes.</i></p>

<p>     <i>With everything that pretty is,</i></p>

<p>        <i>My lady sweet, arise,</i></p>

<p>           <i>Arise, arise.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will</p>

<p>consider your music the better. If it do not, it is a</p>

<p>vice in her ears which horsehairs and calves’</p>

<p>guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot, can</p>

<p>never amend.</p>

<p><center><i>[Musicians exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cymbeline and Queen, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Here comes the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  I am glad I was up so late, for that’s the reason</p>

<p>I was up so early. He cannot choose but take this</p>

<p>service I have done fatherly.–Good morrow to</p>

<p>your Majesty and to my gracious mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?</p>

<p>Will she not forth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  I have assailed her with musics, but she</p>

<p>vouchsafes no notice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>The exile of her minion is too new;</p>

<p>She hath not yet forgot him. Some more time</p>

<p>Must wear the print of his remembrance on ’t,</p>

<p>And then she’s yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <i>[to Cloten]</i>  You are most bound to th’ King,</p>

<p>Who lets go by no vantages that may</p>

<p>Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself</p>

<p>To orderly solicits and be friended</p>

<p>With aptness of the season. Make denials</p>

<p>Increase your services. So seem as if</p>

<p>You were inspired to do those duties which</p>

<p>You tender to her; that you in all obey her,</p>

<p>Save when command to your dismission tends,</p>

<p>And therein you are senseless.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Senseless? Not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc> <i>[to Cymbeline]</i></p>

<p>So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;</p>

<p>The one is Caius Lucius.     <i><i>[Messenger exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  A worthy fellow,</p>

<p>Albeit he comes on angry purpose now.</p>

<p>But that’s no fault of his. We must receive him</p>

<p>According to the honor of his sender,</p>

<p>And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,</p>

<p>We must extend our notice.–Our dear son,</p>

<p>When you have given good morning to your mistress,</p>

<p>Attend the Queen and us. We shall have need</p>

<p>T’ employ you towards this Roman.–Come, our</p>

<p>queen.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cymbeline and Queen exit, with</p>

<p>Lords and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc></p>

<p>If she be up, I’ll speak with her; if not,</p>

<p>Let her lie still and dream. <i>[(He knocks.)]</i> By your</p>

<p>leave, ho!–</p>

<p>I know her women are about her. What</p>

<p>If I do line one of their hands? ’Tis gold</p>

<p>Which buys admittance–oft it doth–yea, and makes</p>

<p>Diana’s rangers false themselves, yield up</p>

<p>Their deer to th’ stand o’ th’ stealer; and ’tis gold</p>

<p>Which makes the true man killed and saves the thief,</p>

<p>Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What</p>

<p>Can it not do and undo? I will make</p>

<p>One of her women lawyer to me, for</p>

<p>I yet not understand the case myself.</p>

<p>By your leave.     <i><i>[Knocks.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Lady.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc></p>

<p>Who’s there that knocks?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  A gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc>  No more?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc></p>

<p>Yes, and a gentlewoman’s son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc>  That’s more</p>

<p>Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours</p>

<p>Can justly boast of. What’s your Lordship’s pleasure?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc></p>

<p>Your lady’s person. Is she ready?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc>  Ay,</p>

<p>To keep her chamber.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  There is gold for you.</p>

<p>Sell me your good report.     <i><i>[He offers a purse.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc></p>

<p>How, my good name? Or to report of you</p>

<p>What I shall think is good?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Imogen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>The Princess.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lady exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc></p>

<p>Good morrow, fairest sister. Your sweet hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains</p>

<p>For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give</p>

<p>Is telling you that I am poor of thanks</p>

<p>And scarce can spare them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Still I swear I love you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>If you but said so, ’twere as deep with me.</p>

<p>If you swear still, your recompense is still</p>

<p>That I regard it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  This is no answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>But that you shall not say I yield being silent,</p>

<p>I would not speak. I pray you, spare me. Faith,</p>

<p>I shall unfold equal discourtesy</p>

<p>To your best kindness. One of your great knowing</p>

<p>Should learn, being taught, forbearance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc></p>

<p>To leave you in your madness ’twere my sin.</p>

<p>I will not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>Fools are not mad folks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Do you call me fool?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc>  As I am mad, I do.</p>

<p>If you’ll be patient, I’ll no more be mad.</p>

<p>That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,</p>

<p>You put me to forget a lady’s manners</p>

<p>By being so verbal; and learn now for all</p>

<p>That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,</p>

<p>By th’ very truth of it, I care not for you,</p>

<p>And am so near the lack of charity</p>

<p>To accuse myself I hate you–which I had rather</p>

<p>You felt than make ’t my boast.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  You sin against</p>

<p>Obedience, which you owe your father. For</p>

<p>The contract you pretend with that base wretch–</p>

<p>One bred of alms and fostered with cold dishes,</p>

<p>With scraps o’ th’ court–it is no contract, none;</p>

<p>And though it be allowed in meaner parties–</p>

<p>Yet who than he more mean?–to knit their souls,</p>

<p>On whom there is no more dependency</p>

<p>But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;</p>

<p>Yet you are curbed from that enlargement by</p>

<p>The consequence o’ th’ crown, and must not foil</p>

<p>The precious note of it with a base slave,</p>

<p>A hilding for a livery, a squire’s cloth,</p>

<p>A pantler–not so eminent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc>  Profane fellow,</p>

<p>Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more</p>

<p>But what thou art besides, thou wert too base</p>

<p>To be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough,</p>

<p>Even to the point of envy, if ’twere made</p>

<p>Comparative for your virtues to be styled</p>

<p>The under-hangman of his kingdom and hated</p>

<p>For being preferred so well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  The south fog rot him!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>He never can meet more mischance than come</p>

<p>To be but named of thee. His mean’st garment</p>

<p>That ever hath but clipped his body is dearer</p>

<p>In my respect than all the hairs above thee,</p>

<p>Were they all made such men.–How now, Pisanio!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pisanio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  “His garment”? Now the devil–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc> <i>[to Pisanio]</i></p>

<p>To Dorothy, my woman, hie thee presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc></p>

<p>“His garment”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc> <i>[to Pisanio]</i>  I am sprighted with a fool,</p>

<p>Frighted and angered worse. Go bid my woman</p>

<p>Search for a jewel that too casually</p>

<p>Hath left mine arm. It was thy master’s. Shrew me</p>

<p>If I would lose it for a revenue</p>

<p>Of any king’s in Europe. I do think</p>

<p>I saw ’t this morning. Confident I am</p>

<p>Last night ’twas on mine arm; I kissed it.</p>

<p>I hope it be not gone to tell my lord</p>

<p>That I kiss aught but he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  ’Twill not be lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>I hope so. Go and search.     <i><i>[Pisanio exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  You have abused me.</p>

<p>“His meanest garment”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc>  Ay, I said so, sir.</p>

<p>If you will make ’t an action, call witness to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc></p>

<p>I will inform your father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc>  Your mother too.</p>

<p>She’s my good lady and will conceive, I hope,</p>

<p>But the worst of me. So I leave you, sir,</p>

<p>To th’ worst of discontent.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc></p>

<p>I’ll be revenged! “His mean’st garment”? Well.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
