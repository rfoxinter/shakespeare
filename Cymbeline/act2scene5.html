<p><span class='sc'>Posthumus</span></p>

<p>Is there no way for men to be, but women</p>

<p>Must be half-workers? We are all bastards,</p>

<p>And that most venerable man which I</p>

<p>Did call my father was I know not where</p>

<p>When I was stamped. Some coiner with his tools</p>

<p>Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seemed</p>

<p>The Dian of that time; so doth my wife</p>

<p>The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!</p>

<p>Me of my lawful pleasure she restrained</p>

<p>And prayed me oft forbearance; did it with</p>

<p>A pudency so rosy the sweet view on ’t</p>

<p>Might well have warmed old Saturn, that I thought</p>

<p>her</p>

<p>As chaste as unsunned snow. O, all the devils!</p>

<p>This yellow Iachimo in an hour, was ’t not?</p>

<p>Or less? At first? Perchance he spoke not, but,</p>

<p>Like a full-acorned boar, a German one,</p>

<p>Cried “O!” and mounted; found no opposition</p>

<p>But what he looked for should oppose and she</p>

<p>Should from encounter guard. Could I find out</p>

<p>The woman’s part in me–for there’s no motion</p>

<p>That tends to vice in man but I affirm</p>

<p>It is the woman’s part: be it lying, note it,</p>

<p>The woman’s; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;</p>

<p>Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;</p>

<p>Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,</p>

<p>Nice longing, slanders, mutability,</p>

<p>All faults that have a name, nay, that hell knows,</p>

<p>Why, hers, in part or all, but rather all.</p>

<p>For even to vice</p>

<p>They are not constant, but are changing still</p>

<p>One vice but of a minute old for one</p>

<p>Not half so old as that. I’ll write against them,</p>

<p>Detest them, curse them. Yet ’tis greater skill</p>

<p>In a true hate to pray they have their will;</p>

<p>The very devils cannot plague them better.</p>
