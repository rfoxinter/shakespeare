<p><center><i>[Enter Pisanio reading of a letter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc></p>

<p>How? Of adultery? Wherefore write you not</p>

<p>What monsters her accuse? Leonatus,</p>

<p>O master, what a strange infection</p>

<p>Is fall’n into thy ear! What false Italian,</p>

<p>As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevailed</p>

<p>On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal? No.</p>

<p>She’s punished for her truth and undergoes,</p>

<p>More goddesslike than wifelike, such assaults</p>

<p>As would take in some virtue. O my master,</p>

<p>Thy mind to her is now as low as were</p>

<p>Thy fortunes. How? That I should murder her,</p>

<p>Upon the love and truth and vows which I</p>

<p>Have made to thy command? I her? Her blood?</p>

<p>If it be so to do good service, never</p>

<p>Let me be counted serviceable. How look I</p>

<p>That I should seem to lack humanity</p>

<p>So much as this fact comes to? <i>[(He reads:)]</i> Do ’t!</p>

<p>The letter</p>

<p>That I have sent her, by her own command</p>

<p>Shall give thee opportunity. O damned paper,</p>

<p>Black as the ink that’s on thee! Senseless bauble,</p>

<p>Art thou a fedary for this act, and look’st</p>

<p>So virginlike without? Lo, here she comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Imogen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>I am ignorant in what I am commanded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc>  How now, Pisanio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc></p>

<p>Madam, here is a letter from my lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives her a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>Who, thy lord that is my lord, Leonatus?</p>

<p>O, learned indeed were that astronomer</p>

<p>That knew the stars as I his characters!</p>

<p>He’d lay the future open. You good gods,</p>

<p>Let what is here contained relish of love,</p>

<p>Of my lord’s health, of his content (yet not</p>

<p>That we two are asunder; let that grieve him.</p>

<p>Some griefs are med’cinable; that is one of them,</p>

<p>For it doth physic love) of his content</p>

<p>All but in that. Good wax, thy leave.</p>

<p><center><i>[She opens the letter.]</i></center></p>

<p>Blest be</p>

<p>You bees that make these locks of counsel. Lovers</p>

<p>And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;</p>

<p>Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet</p>

<p>You clasp young Cupid’s tables. Good news, gods!</p>

<p><i>[Reads.]</i> Justice and your father’s wrath, should he</p>

<p>take me in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me</p>

<p>as you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew</p>

<p>me with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria</p>

<p>at Milford Haven. What your own love will out of</p>

<p>this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all happiness,</p>

<p>that remains loyal to his vow, and your increasing</p>

<p>in love.</p>

<p>Leonatus Posthumus.</p>

<p>O, for a horse with wings! Hear’st thou, Pisanio?</p>

<p>He is at Milford Haven. Read, and tell me</p>

<p>How far ’tis thither. If one of mean affairs</p>

<p>May plod it in a week, why may not I</p>

<p>Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,</p>

<p>Who long’st like me to see thy lord, who long’st–</p>

<p>O, let me bate–but not like me, yet long’st</p>

<p>But in a fainter kind–O, not like me,</p>

<p>For mine’s beyond beyond–say, and speak thick–</p>

<p>Love’s counselor should fill the bores of hearing</p>

<p>To th’ smothering of the sense–how far it is</p>

<p>To this same blessed Milford. And by th’ way</p>

<p>Tell me how Wales was made so happy as</p>

<p>T’ inherit such a haven. But first of all,</p>

<p>How we may steal from hence, and for the gap</p>

<p>That we shall make in time from our hence-going</p>

<p>And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence?</p>

<p>Why should excuse be born or ere begot?</p>

<p>We’ll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,</p>

<p>How many score of miles may we well rid</p>

<p>’Twixt hour and hour?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  One score ’twixt sun and sun,</p>

<p>Madam, ’s enough for you, and too much too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>Why, one that rode to ’s execution, man,</p>

<p>Could never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers</p>

<p>Where horses have been nimbler than the sands</p>

<p>That run i’ th’ clock’s behalf. But this is fool’ry.</p>

<p>Go, bid my woman feign a sickness, say</p>

<p>She’ll home to her father; and provide me presently</p>

<p>A riding suit no costlier than would fit</p>

<p>A franklin’s huswife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  Madam, you’re best consider.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>I see before me, man. Nor here, nor here,</p>

<p>Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them</p>

<p>That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee.</p>

<p>Do as I bid thee. There’s no more to say.</p>

<p>Accessible is none but Milford way.</p>
