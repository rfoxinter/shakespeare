<p><center><i>[Enter Cloten and two Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt. The</p>

<p>violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice.</p>

<p>Where air comes out, air comes in. There’s</p>

<p>none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cloten</span>  If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I</p>

<p>hurt him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span> <i>[aside]</i>  No, faith, not so much as his</p>

<p>patience.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  Hurt him? His body’s a passable carcass if</p>

<p>he be not hurt. It is a thoroughfare for steel if it be</p>

<p>not hurt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span> <i>[aside]</i>  His steel was in debt; it went o’</p>

<p>th’ backside the town.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cloten</span>  The villain would not stand me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span> <i>[aside]</i>  No, but he fled forward still,</p>

<p>toward your face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  Stand you? You have land enough of your</p>

<p>own, but he added to your having, gave you some</p>

<p>ground.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span> <i>[aside]</i>  As many inches as you have</p>

<p>oceans. Puppies!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cloten</span>  I would they had not come between us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span> <i>[aside]</i>  So would I, till you had measured</p>

<p>how long a fool you were upon the ground.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cloten</span>  And that she should love this fellow and</p>

<p>refuse me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span> <i>[aside]</i>  If it be a sin to make a true election,</p>

<p>she is damned.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and</p>

<p>her brain go not together. She’s a good sign, but I</p>

<p>have seen small reflection of her wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span> <i>[aside]</i>  She shines not upon fools, lest</p>

<p>the reflection should hurt her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cloten</span>  Come, I’ll to my chamber. Would there had</p>

<p>been some hurt done!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span> <i>[aside]</i>  I wish not so, unless it had been</p>

<p>the fall of an ass, which is no great hurt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cloten</span>  You’ll go with us?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  I’ll attend your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cloten</span>  Nay, come, let’s go together.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  Well, my lord.</p>
