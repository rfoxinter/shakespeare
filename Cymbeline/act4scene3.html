<p><center><i>[Enter Cymbeline, Lords, Pisanio, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>Again, and bring me word how ’tis with her.</p>

<p><center><i>[An Attendant exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>A fever, with the absence of her son;</p>

<p>A madness, of which her life’s in danger. Heavens,</p>

<p>How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,</p>

<p>The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen</p>

<p>Upon a desperate bed, and in a time</p>

<p>When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,</p>

<p>So needful for this present. It strikes me past</p>

<p>The hope of comfort.–But for thee, fellow,</p>

<p>Who needs must know of her departure and</p>

<p>Dost seem so ignorant, we’ll enforce it from thee</p>

<p>By a sharp torture.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc>  Sir, my life is yours.</p>

<p>I humbly set it at your will. But for my mistress,</p>

<p>I nothing know where she remains, why gone,</p>

<p>Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your</p>

<p>Highness,</p>

<p>Hold me your loyal servant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  Good my liege,</p>

<p>The day that she was missing, he was here.</p>

<p>I dare be bound he’s true and shall perform</p>

<p>All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,</p>

<p>There wants no diligence in seeking him,</p>

<p>And will no doubt be found.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  The time is troublesome.</p>

<p><i>[To Pisanio.]</i> We’ll slip you for a season, but our jealousy</p>

<p>Does yet depend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  So please your Majesty,</p>

<p>The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,</p>

<p>Are landed on your coast with a supply</p>

<p>Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>Now for the counsel of my son and queen!</p>

<p>I am amazed with matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  Good my liege,</p>

<p>Your preparation can affront no less</p>

<p>Than what you hear of. Come more, for more you’re</p>

<p>ready.</p>

<p>The want is but to put those powers in motion</p>

<p>That long to move.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  I thank you. Let’s withdraw,</p>

<p>And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not</p>

<p>What can from Italy annoy us, but</p>

<p>We grieve at chances here. Away.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit. Pisanio remains.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pisanio</sc></p>

<p>I heard no letter from my master since</p>

<p>I wrote him Imogen was slain. ’Tis strange.</p>

<p>Nor hear I from my mistress, who did promise</p>

<p>To yield me often tidings. Neither know I</p>

<p>What is betid to Cloten, but remain</p>

<p>Perplexed in all. The heavens still must work.</p>

<p>Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.</p>

<p>These present wars shall find I love my country,</p>

<p>Even to the note o’ th’ King, or I’ll fall in them.</p>

<p>All other doubts, by time let them be cleared.</p>

<p>Fortune brings in some boats that are not steered.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
