<p><center><i>[Enter Posthumus in chains, and two Jailers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc></p>

<p>You shall not now be stol’n; you have locks upon you.</p>

<p>So graze as you find pasture.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Jailer</sc>  Ay, or a stomach.</p>

<p><center><i>[Jailers exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc></p>

<p>Most welcome, bondage, for thou art a way,</p>

<p>I think, to liberty. Yet am I better</p>

<p>Than one that’s sick o’ th’ gout, since he had rather</p>

<p>Groan so in perpetuity than be cured</p>

<p>By th’ sure physician, Death, who is the key</p>

<p>T’ unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fettered</p>

<p>More than my shanks and wrists. You good gods,</p>

<p>give me</p>

<p>The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,</p>

<p>Then free forever. Is ’t enough I am sorry?</p>

<p>So children temporal fathers do appease;</p>

<p>Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent,</p>

<p>I cannot do it better than in gyves,</p>

<p>Desired more than constrained. To satisfy,</p>

<p>If of my freedom ’tis the main part, take</p>

<p>No stricter render of me than my all.</p>

<p>I know you are more clement than vile men,</p>

<p>Who of their broken debtors take a third,</p>

<p>A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again</p>

<p>On their abatement. That’s not my desire.</p>

<p>For Imogen’s dear life take mine; and though</p>

<p>’Tis not so dear, yet ’tis a life; you coined it.</p>

<p>’Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;</p>

<p>Though light, take pieces for the figure’s sake;</p>

<p>You rather mine, being yours. And so, great powers,</p>

<p>If you will take this audit, take this life</p>

<p>And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen,</p>

<p>I’ll speak to thee in silence.     <i><i>[He lies down and sleeps.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition, Sicilius</p>

<p>Leonatus, father to Posthumus, an old man attired like</p>

<p>a warrior; leading in his hand an ancient matron, his</p>

<p>wife and mother to Posthumus, with music before</p>

<p>them. Then, after other music, follows the two young</p>

<p>Leonati, brothers to Posthumus, with wounds as they</p>

<p>died in the wars. They circle Posthumus round as he</p>

<p>lies sleeping.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicilius</sc></p>

<p>No more, thou Thunder-master, show</p>

<p>   <i>Thy spite on mortal flies.</i></p>

<p>With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,</p>

<p>   <i>That thy adulteries</i></p>

<p>      <i>Rates and revenges.</i></p>

<p>Hath my poor boy done aught but well,</p>

<p>   <i>Whose face I never saw?</i></p>

<p>I died whilst in the womb he stayed,</p>

<p>   <i>Attending nature’s law;</i></p>

<p>Whose father then–as men report</p>

<p>   <i>Thou orphans’ father art–</i></p>

<p>Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him</p>

<p>   <i>From this earth-vexing smart.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mother</sc></p>

<p>Lucina lent not me her aid,</p>

<p>   <i>But took me in my throes,</i></p>

<p>That from me was Posthumus ripped,</p>

<p>   <i>Came crying ’mongst his foes,</i></p>

<p>      <i>A thing of pity.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicilius</sc></p>

<p>Great Nature, like his ancestry,</p>

<p>   <i>Molded the stuff so fair</i></p>

<p>That he deserved the praise o’ th’ world</p>

<p>   <i>As great Sicilius’ heir.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>When once he was mature for man,</p>

<p>   <i>In Britain where was he</i></p>

<p>That could stand up his parallel</p>

<p>   <i>Or fruitful object be</i></p>

<p>In eye of Imogen, that best</p>

<p>   <i>Could deem his dignity?</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mother</sc></p>

<p>With marriage wherefore was he mocked,</p>

<p>   <i>To be exiled and thrown</i></p>

<p>From Leonati seat, and cast</p>

<p>   <i>From her, his dearest one,</i></p>

<p>      <i>Sweet Imogen?</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicilius</sc></p>

<p>Why did you suffer Iachimo,</p>

<p>   <i>Slight thing of Italy,</i></p>

<p>To taint his nobler heart and brain</p>

<p>   <i>With needless jealousy,</i></p>

<p>And to become the geck and scorn</p>

<p>   <i>O’ th’ other’s villainy?</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>For this, from stiller seats we came,</p>

<p>   <i>Our parents and us twain,</i></p>

<p>That striking in our country’s cause</p>

<p>   <i>Fell bravely and were slain,</i></p>

<p>Our fealty and Tenantius’ right</p>

<p>   <i>With honor to maintain.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>Like hardiment Posthumus hath</p>

<p>   <i>To Cymbeline performed.</i></p>

<p>Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,</p>

<p>   <i>Why hast thou thus adjourned</i></p>

<p>The graces for his merits due,</p>

<p>   <i>Being all to dolors turned?</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicilius</sc></p>

<p>Thy crystal window ope; look out.</p>

<p>   <i>No longer exercise</i></p>

<p>Upon a valiant race thy harsh</p>

<p>   <i>And potent injuries.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mother</sc></p>

<p>Since, Jupiter, our son is good,</p>

<p>   <i>Take off his miseries.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicilius</sc></p>

<p>Peep through thy marble mansion. Help,</p>

<p>   <i>Or we poor ghosts will cry</i></p>

<p>To th’ shining synod of the rest</p>

<p>   <i>Against thy deity.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brothers</sc></p>

<p>Help, Jupiter, or we appeal</p>

<p>   <i>And from thy justice fly.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting upon</p>

<p>an eagle. He throws a thunderbolt. The Ghosts fall on</p>

<p>their knees.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jupiter</sc></p>

<p>No more, you petty spirits of region low,</p>

<p>   <i>Offend our hearing! Hush. How dare you ghosts</i></p>

<p>Accuse the Thunderer, whose bolt, you know,</p>

<p>   <i>Sky-planted, batters all rebelling coasts.</i></p>

<p>Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest</p>

<p>   <i>Upon your never-withering banks of flowers.</i></p>

<p>Be not with mortal accidents oppressed.</p>

<p>   <i>No care of yours it is; you know ’tis ours.</i></p>

<p>Whom best I love I cross, to make my gift,</p>

<p>   <i>The more delayed, delighted. Be content.</i></p>

<p>Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift.</p>

<p>   <i>His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.</i></p>

<p>Our Jovial star reigned at his birth, and in</p>

<p>   <i>Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.</i></p>

<p>He shall be lord of Lady Imogen,</p>

<p>   <i>And happier much by his affliction made.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[He hands Sicilius a tablet.]</i></center></p>

<p>This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein</p>

<p>   <i>Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine.</i></p>

<p>And so away. No farther with your din</p>

<p>   <i>Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.–</i></p>

<p>Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.     <i><i>[Ascends.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicilius</sc></p>

<p>He came in thunder. His celestial breath</p>

<p>Was sulphurous to smell. The holy eagle</p>

<p>Stooped as to foot us. His ascension is</p>

<p>More sweet than our blest fields; his royal bird</p>

<p>Preens the immortal wing and cloys his beak,</p>

<p>As when his god is pleased.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Thanks, Jupiter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicilius</sc></p>

<p>The marble pavement closes; he is entered</p>

<p>His radiant roof. Away, and, to be blest,</p>

<p>Let us with care perform his great behest.</p>

<p><center><i>[He places the tablet on Posthumus’ breast. They vanish.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc> <i>[waking]</i></p>

<p>Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire and begot</p>

<p>A father to me, and thou hast created</p>

<p>A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,</p>

<p>Gone! They went hence so soon as they were born.</p>

<p>And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend</p>

<p>On greatness’ favor dream as I have done,</p>

<p>Wake, and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve.</p>

<p>Many dream not to find, neither deserve,</p>

<p>And yet are steeped in favors; so am I</p>

<p>That have this golden chance and know not why.</p>

<p><center><i>[Finding the tablet.]</i></center></p>

<p>What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one,</p>

<p>Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment</p>

<p>Nobler than that it covers. Let thy effects</p>

<p>So follow, to be, most unlike our courtiers,</p>

<p>As good as promise.</p>

<p><center><i>[Reads.]</i></center></p>

<p>Whenas a lion’s whelp shall, to himself unknown,</p>

<p>without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of</p>

<p>tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be</p>

<p>lopped branches which, being dead many years, shall</p>

<p>after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly</p>

<p>grow, then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain</p>

<p>be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.</p>

<p>’Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen</p>

<p>Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing,</p>

<p>Or senseless speaking, or a speaking such</p>

<p>As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,</p>

<p>The action of my life is like it, which</p>

<p>I’ll keep, if but for sympathy.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Jailer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Come, sir, are you ready for death?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Hanging is the word, sir. If you be ready for</p>

<p>that, you are well cooked.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators,</p>

<p>the dish pays the shot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort</p>

<p>is, you shall be called to no more payments, fear</p>

<p>no more tavern bills, which are often the sadness</p>

<p>of parting as the procuring of mirth. You come in</p>

<p>faint for want of meat, depart reeling with too</p>

<p>much drink; sorry that you have paid too much,</p>

<p>and sorry that you are paid too much; purse and</p>

<p>brain both empty; the brain the heavier for being</p>

<p>too light; the purse too light, being drawn of heaviness.</p>

<p>O, of this contradiction you shall now be</p>

<p>quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up</p>

<p>thousands in a trice. You have no true debitor and</p>

<p>creditor but it; of what’s past, is, and to come, the</p>

<p>discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and counters;</p>

<p>so the acquittance follows.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  I am merrier to die than thou art to live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the</p>

<p>toothache. But a man that were to sleep your</p>

<p>sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think</p>

<p>he would change places with his officer; for, look</p>

<p>you, sir, you know not which way you shall go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  Yes, indeed do I, fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Your Death has eyes in ’s head, then. I have not</p>

<p>seen him so pictured. You must either be directed</p>

<p>by some that take upon them to know, or to take</p>

<p>upon yourself that which I am sure you do not</p>

<p>know, or jump the after-inquiry on your own peril.</p>

<p>And how you shall speed in your journey’s end, I</p>

<p>think you’ll never return to tell one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  I tell thee, fellow, there are none want</p>

<p>eyes to direct them the way I am going but such as</p>

<p>wink and will not use them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  What an infinite mock is this, that a man</p>

<p>should have the best use of eyes to see the way of</p>

<p>blindness! I am sure hanging’s the way of winking.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner</p>

<p>to the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  Thou bring’st good news. I am called to be</p>

<p>made free.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  I’ll be hanged then.</p>

<p><center><i>[He removes Posthumus’s chains.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  Thou shalt be then freer than a jailer. No</p>

<p>bolts for the dead.     <i><i>[All but the Jailer exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jailer</sc>  Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget</p>

<p>young gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my</p>

<p>conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,</p>

<p>for all he be a Roman; and there be some of them</p>

<p>too that die against their wills. So should I, if I</p>

<p>were one. I would we were all of one mind, and</p>

<p>one mind good. O, there were desolation of jailers</p>

<p>and gallowses! I speak against my present profit,</p>

<p>but my wish hath a preferment in ’t.</p>
