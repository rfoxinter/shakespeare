<p><center><i>[Enter Cloten and the two Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Was there ever man had such luck? When I</p>

<p>kissed the jack, upon an upcast to be hit away? I</p>

<p>had a hundred pound on ’t. And then a whoreson</p>

<p>jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I</p>

<p>borrowed mine oaths of him and might not spend</p>

<p>them at my pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  What got he by that? You have broke his</p>

<p>pate with your bowl.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  If his wit had been like him that</p>

<p>broke it, it would have run all out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is</p>

<p>not for any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  No, my lord, <i>[(aside)]</i> nor crop the ears</p>

<p>of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Whoreson dog! I gave him satisfaction. Would</p>

<p>he had been one of my rank.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  To have smelled like a fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  I am not vexed more at anything in th’ Earth.</p>

<p>A pox on ’t! I had rather not be so noble as I am.</p>

<p>They dare not fight with me because of the Queen</p>

<p>my mother. Every jack-slave hath his bellyful of</p>

<p>fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock</p>

<p>that nobody can match.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  You are cock and capon too, and</p>

<p>you crow cock with your comb on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Sayest thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  It is not fit your Lordship should undertake</p>

<p>every companion that you give offense to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  No, I know that, but it is fit I should commit</p>

<p>offense to my inferiors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Ay, it is fit for your Lordship only.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Why, so I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Did you hear of a stranger that’s come to</p>

<p>court tonight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  A stranger, and I not know on ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He’s a strange fellow himself and</p>

<p>knows it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  There’s an Italian come, and ’tis thought</p>

<p>one of Leonatus’ friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Leonatus? A banished rascal; and he’s another,</p>

<p>whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  One of your Lordship’s pages.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no</p>

<p>derogation in ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  You cannot derogate, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Not easily, I think.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  You are a fool granted; therefore</p>

<p>your issues, being foolish, do not derogate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Come, I’ll go see this Italian. What I have lost</p>

<p>today at bowls I’ll win tonight of him. Come, go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  I’ll attend your Lordship.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cloten and First Lord exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>That such a crafty devil as is his mother</p>

<p>Should yield the world this ass! A woman that</p>

<p>Bears all down with her brain, and this her son</p>

<p>Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,</p>

<p>And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,</p>

<p>Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur’st,</p>

<p>Betwixt a father by thy stepdame governed,</p>

<p>A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer</p>

<p>More hateful than the foul expulsion is</p>

<p>Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act</p>

<p>Of the divorce he’d make! The heavens hold firm</p>

<p>The walls of thy dear honor, keep unshaked</p>

<p>That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand</p>

<p>T’ enjoy thy banished lord and this great land.</p>
