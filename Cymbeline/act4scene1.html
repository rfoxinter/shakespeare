<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cloten</span>  I am near to th’ place where they should meet,</p>

<p>if Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments</p>

<p>serve me! Why should his mistress, who</p>

<p>was made by him that made the tailor, not be fit</p>

<p>too? The rather, saving reverence of the word, for</p>

<p>’tis said a woman’s fitness comes by fits. Therein I</p>

<p>must play the workman. I dare speak it to myself,</p>

<p>for it is not vainglory for a man and his glass to</p>

<p>confer in his own chamber. I mean, the lines of my</p>

<p>body are as well drawn as his, no less young, more</p>

<p>strong; not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him</p>

<p>in the advantage of the time, above him in birth,</p>

<p>alike conversant in general services, and more remarkable</p>

<p>in single oppositions. Yet this imperceiverant</p>

<p>thing loves him in my despite. What</p>

<p>mortality is! Posthumus, thy head, which now is</p>

<p>growing upon thy shoulders, shall within this hour</p>

<p>be off, thy mistress enforced, thy garments cut to</p>

<p>pieces before thy face; and all this done, spurn her</p>

<p>home to her father, who may haply be a little angry</p>

<p>or my so rough usage. But my mother, having</p>

<p>power of his testiness, shall turn all into my commendations.</p>

<p>My horse is tied up safe. Out, sword,</p>

<p>and to a sore purpose. Fortune, put them into my</p>

<p>hand! This is the very description of their meeting</p>

<p>place, and the fellow dares not deceive me.</p>
