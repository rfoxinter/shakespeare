<p><center><i>[A trunk is brought in. Enter Imogen, reading, in her</p>

<p>bed, and a Lady.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>Who’s there? My woman Helen?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc>  Please you, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>What hour is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc>  Almost midnight, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Imogen</sc></p>

<p>I have read three hours then. Mine eyes are weak.</p>

<p><center><i>[She hands the Lady her book.]</i></center></p>

<p>Fold down the leaf where I have left. To bed.</p>

<p>Take not away the taper; leave it burning.</p>

<p>And if thou canst awake by four o’ th’ clock,</p>

<p>I prithee, call me. <i>[(Lady exits.)]</i> Sleep hath seized</p>

<p>me wholly.</p>

<p>To your protection I commend me, gods.</p>

<p>From fairies and the tempters of the night</p>

<p>Guard me, beseech you.     <i><i>[Sleeps.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Iachimo from the trunk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iachimo</sc></p>

<p>The crickets sing, and man’s o’erlabored sense</p>

<p>Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus</p>

<p>Did softly press the rushes ere he wakened</p>

<p>The chastity he wounded.–Cytherea,</p>

<p>How bravely thou becom’st thy bed, fresh lily,</p>

<p>And whiter than the sheets.–That I might touch!</p>

<p>But kiss, one kiss! Rubies unparagoned,</p>

<p>How dearly they do ’t. ’Tis her breathing that</p>

<p>Perfumes the chamber thus. The flame o’ th’ taper</p>

<p>Bows toward her and would underpeep her lids</p>

<p>To see th’ enclosed lights, now canopied</p>

<p>Under these windows, white and azure-laced</p>

<p>With blue of heaven’s own tinct. But my design:</p>

<p>To note the chamber. I will write all down.</p>

<p><center><i>[He begins to write.]</i></center></p>

<p>Such and such pictures; there the window; such</p>

<p>Th’ adornment of her bed; the arras, figures,</p>

<p>Why, such and such; and the contents o’ th’ story.</p>

<p><center><i>[He continues to write.]</i></center></p>

<p>Ah, but some natural notes about her body</p>

<p>Above ten thousand meaner movables</p>

<p>Would testify t’ enrich mine inventory.</p>

<p>O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her,</p>

<p>And be her sense but as a monument</p>

<p>Thus in a chapel lying. <i>[(He begins to remove her</p>

<p>bracelet.)]</i> Come off, come off;</p>

<p>As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard.</p>

<p>’Tis mine, and this will witness outwardly</p>

<p>As strongly as the conscience does within</p>

<p>To th’ madding of her lord. On her left breast</p>

<p>A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops</p>

<p>I’ th’ bottom of a cowslip. Here’s a voucher</p>

<p>Stronger than ever law could make. This secret</p>

<p>Will force him think I have picked the lock and ta’en</p>

<p>The treasure of her honor. No more. To what end?</p>

<p>Why should I write this down that’s riveted,</p>

<p>Screwed to my memory? She hath been reading late</p>

<p>The tale of Tereus; here the leaf’s turned down</p>

<p>Where Philomel gave up. I have enough.</p>

<p>To th’ trunk again, and shut the spring of it.</p>

<p>Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning</p>

<p>May bare the raven’s eye. I lodge in fear.</p>

<p>Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.</p>

<p><center><i>[Clock strikes.]</i></center></p>

<p>One, two, three. Time, time!</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits into the trunk. The trunk</p>

<p>and bed are removed.]</i></center></p>
