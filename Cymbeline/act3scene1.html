<p><center><i>[Enter in state Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten, and Lords at</p>

<p>one door, and, at another, Caius Lucius and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet</p>

<p>Lives in men’s eyes and will to ears and tongues</p>

<p>Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain</p>

<p>And conquered it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,</p>

<p>Famous in Caesar’s praises no whit less</p>

<p>Than in his feats deserving it, for him</p>

<p>And his succession granted Rome a tribute,</p>

<p>Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately</p>

<p>Is left untendered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  And, to kill the marvel,</p>

<p>Shall be so ever.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  There be many Caesars</p>

<p>Ere such another Julius. Britain’s a world</p>

<p>By itself, and we will nothing pay</p>

<p>For wearing our own noses.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  That opportunity</p>

<p>Which then they had to take from ’s, to resume</p>

<p>We have again.–Remember, sir, my liege,</p>

<p>The Kings your ancestors, together with</p>

<p>The natural bravery of your isle, which stands</p>

<p>As Neptune’s park, ribbed and paled in</p>

<p>With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,</p>

<p>With sands that will not bear your enemies’ boats</p>

<p>But suck them up to th’ topmast. A kind of conquest</p>

<p>Caesar made here, but made not here his brag</p>

<p>Of “came, and saw, and overcame.” With shame–</p>

<p>The first that ever touched him–he was carried</p>

<p>From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping,</p>

<p>Poor ignorant baubles, on our terrible seas</p>

<p>Like eggshells moved upon their surges, cracked</p>

<p>As easily ’gainst our rocks. For joy whereof</p>

<p>The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point–</p>

<p>O, giglet Fortune!–to master Caesar’s sword,</p>

<p>Made Lud’s Town with rejoicing fires bright</p>

<p>And Britons strut with courage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  Come, there’s no more tribute to be paid. Our</p>

<p>kingdom is stronger than it was at that time, and,</p>

<p>as I said, there is no more such Caesars. Other of</p>

<p>them may have crooked noses, but to owe such</p>

<p>straight arms, none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  Son, let your mother end.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  We have yet many among us can grip as hard</p>

<p>as Cassibelan. I do not say I am one, but I have a</p>

<p>hand. Why tribute? Why should we pay tribute? If</p>

<p>Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or</p>

<p>put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute</p>

<p>for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc> <i>[to Lucius]</i>  You must know,</p>

<p>Till the injurious Romans did extort</p>

<p>This tribute from us, we were free. Caesar’s ambition,</p>

<p>Which swelled so much that it did almost stretch</p>

<p>The sides o’ th’ world, against all color here</p>

<p>Did put the yoke upon ’s, which to shake off</p>

<p>Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon</p>

<p>Ourselves to be. We do say, then, to Caesar,</p>

<p>Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which</p>

<p>Ordained our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar</p>

<p>Hath too much mangled, whose repair and franchise</p>

<p>Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,</p>

<p>Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made</p>

<p>our laws,</p>

<p>Who was the first of Britain which did put</p>

<p>His brows within a golden crown and called</p>

<p>Himself a king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  I am sorry, Cymbeline,</p>

<p>That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar–</p>

<p>Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than</p>

<p>Thyself domestic officers–thine enemy.</p>

<p>Receive it from me, then: war and confusion</p>

<p>In Caesar’s name pronounce I ’gainst thee. Look</p>

<p>For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,</p>

<p>I thank thee for myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc>  Thou art welcome, Caius.</p>

<p>Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent</p>

<p>Much under him. Of him I gathered honor,</p>

<p>Which he to seek of me again perforce</p>

<p>Behooves me keep at utterance. I am perfect</p>

<p>That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for</p>

<p>Their liberties are now in arms, a precedent</p>

<p>Which not to read would show the Britons cold.</p>

<p>So Caesar shall not find them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  Let proof speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cloten</sc>  His Majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime</p>

<p>with us a day or two, or longer. If you seek us afterwards</p>

<p>in other terms, you shall find us in our saltwater</p>

<p>girdle; if you beat us out of it, it is yours. If</p>

<p>you fall in the adventure, our crows shall fare the</p>

<p>better for you, and there’s an end.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  So, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cymbeline</sc></p>

<p>I know your master’s pleasure, and he mine.</p>

<p>All the remain is welcome.</p>
