<p><center><i>[Enter Posthumus and a Briton Lord.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Cam’st thou from where they made the stand?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  I did,</p>

<p>Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  Ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc></p>

<p>No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost,</p>

<p>But that the heavens fought. The King himself</p>

<p>Of his wings destitute, the army broken,</p>

<p>And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying</p>

<p>Through a strait lane; the enemy full-hearted,</p>

<p>Lolling the tongue with slaught’ring, having work</p>

<p>More plentiful than tools to do ’t, struck down</p>

<p>Some mortally, some slightly touched, some falling</p>

<p>Merely through fear, that the strait pass was dammed</p>

<p>With dead men hurt behind and cowards living</p>

<p>To die with lengthened shame.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  Where was this lane?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc></p>

<p>Close by the battle, ditched, and walled with turf;</p>

<p>Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,</p>

<p>An honest one, I warrant, who deserved</p>

<p>So long a breeding as his white beard came to,</p>

<p>In doing this for ’s country. Athwart the lane,</p>

<p>He with two striplings–lads more like to run</p>

<p>The country base than to commit such slaughter,</p>

<p>With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer</p>

<p>Than those for preservation cased or shame–</p>

<p>Made good the passage, cried to those that fled</p>

<p>“Our Britain’s harts die flying, not our men.</p>

<p>To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand,</p>

<p>Or we are Romans and will give you that</p>

<p>Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save</p>

<p>But to look back in frown. Stand, stand!” These three,</p>

<p>Three thousand confident, in act as many–</p>

<p>For three performers are the file when all</p>

<p>The rest do nothing–with this word “Stand, stand,”</p>

<p>Accommodated by the place, more charming</p>

<p>With their own nobleness, which could have turned</p>

<p>A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,</p>

<p>Part shame, part spirit renewed; that some, turned</p>

<p>coward</p>

<p>But by example–O, a sin in war,</p>

<p>Damned in the first beginners!–gan to look</p>

<p>The way that they did and to grin like lions</p>

<p>Upon the pikes o’ th’ hunters. Then began</p>

<p>A stop i’ th’ chaser, a retire; anon</p>

<p>A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly</p>

<p>Chickens the way which they stooped eagles; slaves</p>

<p>The strides they victors made; and now our</p>

<p>cowards,</p>

<p>Like fragments in hard voyages, became</p>

<p>The life o’ th’ need. Having found the backdoor open</p>

<p>Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!</p>

<p>Some slain before, some dying, some their friends</p>

<p>O’erborne i’ th’ former wave, ten chased by one,</p>

<p>Are now each one the slaughterman of twenty.</p>

<p>Those that would die or ere resist are grown</p>

<p>The mortal bugs o’ th’ field.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  This was strange chance:</p>

<p>A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc></p>

<p>Nay, do not wonder at it. You are made</p>

<p>Rather to wonder at the things you hear</p>

<p>Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon ’t</p>

<p>And vent it for a mock’ry? Here is one:</p>

<p>“Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,</p>

<p>Preserved the Britons, was the Romans’ bane.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Nay, be not angry, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  ’Lack, to what end?</p>

<p>Who dares not stand his foe, I’ll be his friend;</p>

<p>For if he’ll do as he is made to do,</p>

<p>I know he’ll quickly fly my friendship too.</p>

<p>You have put me into rhyme.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  Farewell. You’re angry.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc></p>

<p>Still going? This is a lord! O noble misery,</p>

<p>To be i’ th’ field and ask “What news?” of me!</p>

<p>Today how many would have given their honors</p>

<p>To have saved their carcasses, took heel to do ’t,</p>

<p>And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charmed,</p>

<p>Could not find Death where I did hear him groan,</p>

<p>Nor feel him where he struck. Being an ugly monster,</p>

<p>’Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,</p>

<p>Sweet words, or hath more ministers than we</p>

<p>That draw his knives i’ th’ war. Well, I will find him;</p>

<p>For being now a favorer to the Briton,</p>

<p>No more a Briton. <i>[(He removes his peasant</p>

<p>costume.)]</i> I have resumed again</p>

<p>The part I came in. Fight I will no more,</p>

<p>But yield me to the veriest hind that shall</p>

<p>Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is</p>

<p>Here made by th’ Roman; great the answer be</p>

<p>Britons must take. For me, my ransom’s death.</p>

<p>On either side I come to spend my breath,</p>

<p>Which neither here I’ll keep nor bear again,</p>

<p>But end it by some means for Imogen.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter two Briton Captains, and Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>Great Jupiter be praised, Lucius is taken!</p>

<p>’Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>There was a fourth man in a silly habit</p>

<p>That gave th’ affront with them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Captain</sc>  So ’tis reported,</p>

<p>But none of ’em can be found.–Stand. Who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Posthumus</sc>  A Roman,</p>

<p>Who had not now been drooping here if seconds</p>

<p>Had answered him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Captain</sc>  Lay hands on him. A dog,</p>

<p>A leg of Rome shall not return to tell</p>

<p>What crows have pecked them here. He brags his</p>

<p>service</p>

<p>As if he were of note. Bring him to th’ King.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cymbeline, Attendants, Belarius as Morgan,</p>

<p>Guiderius as Polydor, Arviragus as Cadwal, Pisanio,</p>
