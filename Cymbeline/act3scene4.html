<p><center><i>[Enter Pisanio and Imogen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>Thou told’st me, when we came from horse, the place</p>

<p>Was near at hand. Ne’er longed my mother so</p>

<p>To see me first as I have now. Pisanio, man,</p>

<p>Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind</p>

<p>That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that</p>

<p>sigh</p>

<p>From th’ inward of thee? One but painted thus</p>

<p>Would be interpreted a thing perplexed</p>

<p>Beyond self-explication. Put thyself</p>

<p>Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness</p>

<p>Vanquish my staider senses. What’s the matter?</p>

<p><center><i>[Pisanio hands her a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>Why tender’st thou that paper to me with</p>

<p>A look untender? If ’t be summer news,</p>

<p>Smile to ’t before; if winterly, thou need’st</p>

<p>But keep that count’nance still. My husband’s hand!</p>

<p>That drug-damned Italy hath out-craftied him,</p>

<p>And he’s at some hard point. Speak, man! Thy tongue</p>

<p>May take off some extremity, which to read</p>

<p>Would be even mortal to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  Please you read,</p>

<p>And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing</p>

<p>The most disdained of fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[reads:]</i>  Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the</p>

<p>strumpet in my bed, the testimonies whereof lies</p>

<p>bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises but</p>

<p>from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I</p>

<p>expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act</p>

<p>for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of</p>

<p>hers. Let thine own hands take away her life. I shall</p>

<p>give thee opportunity at Milford Haven–she hath</p>

<p>my letter for the purpose–where, if thou fear to</p>

<p>strike and to make me certain it is done, thou art the</p>

<p>pander to her dishonor and equally to me disloyal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>What shall I need to draw my sword? The paper</p>

<p>Hath cut her throat already. No, ’tis slander,</p>

<p>Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue</p>

<p>Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath</p>

<p>Rides on the posting winds and doth belie</p>

<p>All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,</p>

<p>Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave</p>

<p>This viperous slander enters.–What cheer, madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>False to his bed? What is it to be false?</p>

<p>To lie in watch there and to think on him?</p>

<p>To weep ’twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge nature,</p>

<p>To break it with a fearful dream of him</p>

<p>And cry myself awake? That’s false to ’s bed, is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  Alas, good lady!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>I false? Thy conscience witness! Iachimo,</p>

<p>Thou didst accuse him of incontinency.</p>

<p>Thou then looked’st like a villain. Now methinks</p>

<p>Thy favor’s good enough. Some jay of Italy,</p>

<p>Whose mother was her painting, hath betrayed him.</p>

<p>Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,</p>

<p>And, for I am richer than to hang by th’ walls,</p>

<p>I must be ripped. To pieces with me! O,</p>

<p>Men’s vows are women’s traitors! All good seeming,</p>

<p>By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought</p>

<p>Put on for villainy, not born where ’t grows,</p>

<p>But worn a bait for ladies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  Good madam, hear me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>True honest men, being heard like false Aeneas,</p>

<p>Were in his time thought false, and Sinon’s weeping</p>

<p>Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity</p>

<p>From most true wretchedness. So thou, Posthumus,</p>

<p>Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;</p>

<p>Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured</p>

<p>From thy great fail.–Come, fellow, be thou honest;</p>

<p>Do thou thy master’s bidding. When thou seest him,</p>

<p>A little witness my obedience. Look,</p>

<p>I draw the sword myself.</p>

<p><center><i>[She draws Pisanio’s sword from its</p>

<p>scabbard and hands it to him.]</i></center></p>

<p>Take it, and hit</p>

<p>The innocent mansion of my love, my heart.</p>

<p>Fear not; ’tis empty of all things but grief.</p>

<p>Thy master is not there, who was indeed</p>

<p>The riches of it. Do his bidding; strike.</p>

<p>Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause,</p>

<p>But now thou seem’st a coward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span> <i>[throwing down the sword]</i>  Hence, vile</p>

<p>instrument!</p>

<p>Thou shalt not damn my hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Why, I must die,</p>

<p>And if I do not by thy hand, thou art</p>

<p>No servant of thy master’s. Against self-slaughter</p>

<p>There is a prohibition so divine</p>

<p>That cravens my weak hand. Come, here’s my heart–</p>

<p>Something’s afore ’t. Soft, soft! We’ll no defense–</p>

<p>Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?</p>

<p><center><i>[She takes papers from her bodice.]</i></center></p>

<p>The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,</p>

<p>All turned to heresy? Away, away!</p>

<p><center><i>[She throws away the letters.]</i></center></p>

<p>Corrupters of my faith, you shall no more</p>

<p>Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools</p>

<p>Believe false teachers. Though those that are betrayed</p>

<p>Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor</p>

<p>Stands in worse case of woe. And thou, Posthumus,</p>

<p>That didst set up</p>

<p>My disobedience ’gainst the King my father</p>

<p>And make me put into contempt the suits</p>

<p>Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find</p>

<p>It is no act of common passage, but</p>

<p>A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself</p>

<p>To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her</p>

<p>That now thou tirest on, how thy memory</p>

<p>Will then be panged by me.–Prithee, dispatch.</p>

<p>The lamb entreats the butcher. Where’s thy knife?</p>

<p>Thou art too slow to do thy master’s bidding</p>

<p>When I desire it too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  O gracious lady,</p>

<p>Since I received command to do this business</p>

<p>I have not slept one wink.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Do ’t, and to bed, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span></p>

<p>I’ll wake mine eyeballs out first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Wherefore then</p>

<p>Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused</p>

<p>So many miles with a pretense? This place?</p>

<p>Mine action and thine own? Our horses’ labor?</p>

<p>The time inviting thee? The perturbed court</p>

<p>For my being absent, whereunto I never</p>

<p>Purpose return? Why hast thou gone so far</p>

<p>To be unbent when thou hast ta’en thy stand,</p>

<p>Th’ elected deer before thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  But to win time</p>

<p>To lose so bad employment, in the which</p>

<p>I have considered of a course. Good lady,</p>

<p>Hear me with patience.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Talk thy tongue weary.</p>

<p>Speak.</p>

<p>I have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear,</p>

<p>Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,</p>

<p>Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  Then, madam,</p>

<p>I thought you would not back again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Most like,</p>

<p>Bringing me here to kill me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  Not so, neither.</p>

<p>But if I were as wise as honest, then</p>

<p>My purpose would prove well. It cannot be</p>

<p>But that my master is abused. Some villain,</p>

<p>Ay, and singular in his art, hath done</p>

<p>You both this cursed injury.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>Some Roman courtesan?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  No, on my life.</p>

<p>I’ll give but notice you are dead, and send him</p>

<p>Some bloody sign of it, for ’tis commanded</p>

<p>I should do so. You shall be missed at court,</p>

<p>And that will well confirm it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Why, good fellow,</p>

<p>What shall I do the while? Where bide? How live?</p>

<p>Or in my life what comfort when I am</p>

<p>Dead to my husband?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  If you’ll back to th’ court–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span></p>

<p>No court, no father, nor no more ado</p>

<p>With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,</p>

<p>That Cloten, whose love suit hath been to me</p>

<p>As fearful as a siege.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  If not at court,</p>

<p>Then not in Britain must you bide.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Where, then?</p>

<p>Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,</p>

<p>Are they not but in Britain? I’ th’ world’s volume</p>

<p>Our Britain seems as of it, but not in ’t,</p>

<p>In a great pool a swan’s nest. Prithee think</p>

<p>There’s livers out of Britain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  I am most glad</p>

<p>You think of other place. Th’ ambassador,</p>

<p>Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford Haven</p>

<p>Tomorrow. Now, if you could wear a mind</p>

<p>Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise</p>

<p>That which t’ appear itself must not yet be</p>

<p>But by self-danger, you should tread a course</p>

<p>Pretty and full of view: yea, haply near</p>

<p>The residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least,</p>

<p>That though his actions were not visible, yet</p>

<p>Report should render him hourly to your ear</p>

<p>As truly as he moves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  O, for such means,</p>

<p>Though peril to my modesty, not death on ’t,</p>

<p>I would adventure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  Well then, here’s the point:</p>

<p>You must forget to be a woman; change</p>

<p>Command into obedience, fear and niceness–</p>

<p>The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,</p>

<p>Woman it pretty self–into a waggish courage,</p>

<p>Ready in gibes, quick-answered, saucy, and</p>

<p>As quarrelous as the weasel. Nay, you must</p>

<p>Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,</p>

<p>Exposing it–but O, the harder heart!</p>

<p>Alack, no remedy–to the greedy touch</p>

<p>Of common-kissing Titan, and forget</p>

<p>Your laborsome and dainty trims, wherein</p>

<p>You made great Juno angry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Nay, be brief.</p>

<p>I see into thy end and am almost</p>

<p>A man already.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span>  First, make yourself but like one.</p>

<p>Forethinking this, I have already fit–</p>

<p>’Tis in my cloakbag–doublet, hat, hose, all</p>

<p>That answer to them. Would you, in their serving,</p>

<p>And with what imitation you can borrow</p>

<p>From youth of such a season, ’fore noble Lucius</p>

<p>Present yourself, desire his service, tell him</p>

<p>Wherein you’re happy–which will make him know,</p>

<p>If that his head have ear in music–doubtless</p>

<p>With joy he will embrace you, for he’s honorable</p>

<p>And, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad:</p>

<p>You have me, rich, and I will never fail</p>

<p>Beginning nor supplyment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span> <i>[taking the cloakbag]</i>  Thou art all the comfort</p>

<p>The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away.</p>

<p>There’s more to be considered, but we’ll even</p>

<p>All that good time will give us. This attempt</p>

<p>I am soldier to, and will abide it with</p>

<p>A prince’s courage. Away, I prithee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pisanio</span></p>

<p>Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,</p>

<p>Lest, being missed, I be suspected of</p>

<p>Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,</p>

<p>Here is a box. I had it from the Queen.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands her the box.]</i></center></p>

<p>What’s in ’t is precious. If you are sick at sea</p>

<p>Or stomach-qualmed at land, a dram of this</p>

<p>Will drive away distemper. To some shade,</p>

<p>And fit you to your manhood. May the gods</p>

<p>Direct you to the best.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Imogen</span>  Amen. I thank thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
