<p><center><i>[Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, Jaques, Orlando, Oliver,</p>

<p>and Celia as Aliena.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span></p>

<p>Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy</p>

<p>Can do all this that he hath promised?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span></p>

<p>I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not,</p>

<p>As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Rosalind as Ganymede, Silvius, and Phoebe.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>Patience once more whiles our compact is urged.</p>

<p><i>[To Duke.]</i> You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,</p>

<p>You will bestow her on Orlando here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span></p>

<p>That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede, to Orlando]</i></p>

<p>And you say you will have her when I bring her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span></p>

<p>That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede, to Phoebe]</i></p>

<p>You say you’ll marry me if I be willing?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span></p>

<p>That will I, should I die the hour after.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>But if you do refuse to marry me,</p>

<p>You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span>  So is the bargain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede, to Silvius]</i></p>

<p>You say that you’ll have Phoebe if she will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span></p>

<p>Though to have her and death were both one thing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>I have promised to make all this matter even.</p>

<p>Keep you your word, O duke, to give your</p>

<p>daughter,–</p>

<p>You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter.–</p>

<p>Keep you your word, Phoebe, that you’ll marry me,</p>

<p>Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd.–</p>

<p>Keep your word, Silvius, that you’ll marry her</p>

<p>If she refuse me. And from hence I go</p>

<p>To make these doubts all even.</p>

<p><center><i>[Rosalind and Celia exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span></p>

<p>I do remember in this shepherd boy</p>

<p>Some lively touches of my daughter’s favor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span></p>

<p>My lord, the first time that I ever saw him</p>

<p>Methought he was a brother to your daughter.</p>

<p>But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born</p>

<p>And hath been tutored in the rudiments</p>

<p>Of many desperate studies by his uncle,</p>

<p>Whom he reports to be a great magician</p>

<p>Obscured in the circle of this forest.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Touchstone and Audrey.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  There is sure another flood toward, and these</p>

<p>couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of</p>

<p>very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called</p>

<p>fools.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Salutation and greeting to you all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span> <i>[to Duke]</i>  Good my lord, bid him welcome.</p>

<p>This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so</p>

<p>often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he</p>

<p>swears.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  If any man doubt that, let him put me to</p>

<p>my purgation. I have trod a measure. I have flattered</p>

<p>a lady. I have been politic with my friend,</p>

<p>smooth with mine enemy. I have undone three</p>

<p>tailors. I have had four quarrels, and like to have</p>

<p>fought one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  And how was that ta’en up?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Faith, we met and found the quarrel was</p>

<p>upon the seventh cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  How “seventh cause”?–Good my lord, like</p>

<p>this fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span>  I like him very well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  God ’ild you, sir. I desire you of the like. I</p>

<p>press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country</p>

<p>copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as</p>

<p>marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir,</p>

<p>an ill-favored thing, sir, but mine own. A poor</p>

<p>humor of mine, sir, to take that that no man else</p>

<p>will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor</p>

<p>house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span>  By my faith, he is very swift and</p>

<p>sententious.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  According to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such</p>

<p>dulcet diseases.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  But for the seventh cause. How did you find the</p>

<p>quarrel on the seventh cause?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Upon a lie seven times removed.–Bear</p>

<p>your body more seeming, Audrey.–As thus, sir: I</p>

<p>did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He</p>

<p>sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he</p>

<p>was in the mind it was. This is called “the retort</p>

<p>courteous.” If I sent him word again it was not well</p>

<p>cut, he would send me word he cut it to please</p>

<p>himself. This is called “the quip modest.” If again it</p>

<p>was not well cut, he disabled my judgment. This is</p>

<p>called “the reply churlish.” If again it was not well</p>

<p>cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is called</p>

<p>“the reproof valiant.” If again it was not well cut, he</p>

<p>would say I lie. This is called “the countercheck</p>

<p>quarrelsome,” and so to “the lie circumstantial,”</p>

<p>and “the lie direct.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  And how oft did you say his beard was not well</p>

<p>cut?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial,</p>

<p>nor he durst not give me the lie direct, and</p>

<p>so we measured swords and parted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  Can you nominate in order now the degrees of</p>

<p>the lie?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as</p>

<p>you have books for good manners. I will name you</p>

<p>the degrees: the first, “the retort courteous”; the</p>

<p>second, “the quip modest”; the third, “the reply</p>

<p>churlish”; the fourth, “the reproof valiant”; the</p>

<p>fifth, “the countercheck quarrelsome”; the sixth,</p>

<p>“the lie with circumstance”; the seventh, “the lie</p>

<p>direct.” All these you may avoid but the lie direct,</p>

<p>and you may avoid that too with an “if.” I knew</p>

<p>when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but</p>

<p>when the parties were met themselves, one of them</p>

<p>thought but of an “if,” as: “If you said so, then I said</p>

<p>so.” And they shook hands and swore brothers.</p>

<p>Your “if” is the only peacemaker: much virtue in</p>

<p>“if.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span> <i>[to Duke]</i>  Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?</p>

<p>He’s as good at anything and yet a fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span>  He uses his folly like a stalking-horse,</p>

<p>and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hymen, Rosalind, and Celia. Still music.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hymen</span></p>

<p>     <i>Then is there mirth in heaven</i></p>

<p>     <i>When earthly things made even</i></p>

<p>        <i>Atone together.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Good duke, receive thy daughter.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Hymen from heaven brought her,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Yea, brought her hither,</i></p>

<p>     <i>That thou mightst join her hand with his,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Whose heart within his bosom is.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[to Duke]</i></p>

<p>To you I give myself, for I am yours.</p>

<p><i>[To Orlando.]</i> To you I give myself, for I am yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span></p>

<p>If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span></p>

<p>If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span></p>

<p>If sight and shape be true,</p>

<p>Why then, my love adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[to Duke]</i></p>

<p>I’ll have no father, if you be not he.</p>

<p><i>[To Orlando.]</i> I’ll have no husband, if you be not he,</p>

<p><i>[To Phoebe.]</i> Nor ne’er wed woman, if you be not</p>

<p>     <i>You and you are sure together</i></p>

<p>     <i>As the winter to foul weather.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Whiles a wedlock hymn we sing,</i></p>

<p>O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me,</p>

<p>Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span> <i>[to Silvius]</i></p>

<p>I will not eat my word. Now thou art mine,</p>

<p>Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Second Brother, Jaques de Boys.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Brother</span></p>

<p>Let me have audience for a word or two.</p>

<p>I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,</p>

<p>That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.</p>

<p>Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day</p>

<p>Men of great worth resorted to this forest,</p>

<p>Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot</p>

<p>In his own conduct, purposely to take</p>

<p>His brother here and put him to the sword;</p>

<p>And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,</p>

<p>Where, meeting with an old religious man,</p>

<p>After some question with him, was converted</p>

<p>Both from his enterprise and from the world,</p>

<p>His crown bequeathing to his banished brother,</p>

<p>And all their lands restored to them again</p>

<p>That were with him exiled. This to be true</p>

<p>I do engage my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span>  Welcome, young man.</p>

<p>Thou offer’st fairly to thy brothers’ wedding:</p>

<p>To one his lands withheld, and to the other</p>

<p>A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.–</p>

<p>First, in this forest let us do those ends</p>

<p>That here were well begun and well begot,</p>

<p>And, after, every of this happy number</p>

<p>That have endured shrewd days and nights with us</p>

<p>Shall share the good of our returned fortune</p>

<p>According to the measure of their states.</p>

<p>Meantime, forget this new-fall’n dignity,</p>

<p>And fall into our rustic revelry.–</p>

<p>Play, music.–And you brides and bridegrooms all,</p>

<p>With measure heaped in joy to th’ measures fall.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span> <i>[to Second Brother]</i></p>

<p>Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly,</p>

<p>The Duke hath put on a religious life</p>

<p>And thrown into neglect the pompous court.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Brother</span>  He hath.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span></p>

<p>To him will I. Out of these convertites</p>

<p>There is much matter to be heard and learned.</p>

<p><i>[To Duke.]</i> You to your former honor I bequeath;</p>

<p>Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.</p>

<p><i>[To Orlando.]</i> You to a love that your true faith doth</p>

<p>merit.</p>

<p><i>[To Oliver.]</i> You to your land, and love, and great</p>

<p>allies.</p>

<p><i>[To Silvius.]</i> You to a long and well-deserved bed.</p>

<p><i>[To Touchstone.]</i> And you to wrangling, for thy</p>

<p>loving voyage</p>

<p>Is but for two months victualled.–So to your</p>

<p>pleasures.</p>

<p>I am for other than for dancing measures.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span>  Stay, Jaques, stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span></p>

<p>To see no pastime, I. What you would have</p>

<p>I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span></p>

<p>Proceed, proceed. We’ll begin these rites,</p>

<p>As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.</p>
