<p><center><i>[Enter Rosalind and Celia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am</p>

<p>mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier?</p>

<p>Unless you could teach me to forget a banished</p>

<p>father, you must not learn me how to remember</p>

<p>any extraordinary pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full</p>

<p>weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished</p>

<p>father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father,</p>

<p>so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught</p>

<p>my love to take thy father for mine. So wouldst thou,</p>

<p>if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously</p>

<p>tempered as mine is to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Well, I will forget the condition of my estate</p>

<p>to rejoice in yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  You know my father hath no child but I, nor</p>

<p>none is like to have; and truly, when he dies, thou</p>

<p>shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from</p>

<p>thy father perforce, I will render thee again in</p>

<p>affection. By mine honor I will, and when I break</p>

<p>that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet</p>

<p>Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  From henceforth I will, coz, and devise</p>

<p>sports. Let me see–what think you of falling in</p>

<p>love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but</p>

<p>love no man in good earnest, nor no further in</p>

<p>sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou</p>

<p>mayst in honor come off again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  What shall be our sport, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune</p>

<p>from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be</p>

<p>bestowed equally.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  I would we could do so, for her benefits are</p>

<p>mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman</p>

<p>doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  ’Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce</p>

<p>makes honest, and those that she makes honest she</p>

<p>makes very ill-favoredly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to</p>

<p>Nature’s. Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in</p>

<p>the lineaments of nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  No? When Nature hath made a fair creature,</p>

<p>may she not by fortune fall into the fire?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Touchstone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune,</p>

<p>hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the</p>

<p>argument?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature,</p>

<p>when Fortune makes Nature’s natural the</p>

<p>cutter-off of Nature’s wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither,</p>

<p>but Nature’s, who perceiveth our natural wits too</p>

<p>dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent</p>

<p>this natural for our whetstone, for always the dullness</p>

<p>of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. <i>[To</p>

<p>Touchstone.]</i> How now, wit, whither wander you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Mistress, you must come away to your</p>

<p>father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Were you made the messenger?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  No, by mine honor, but I was bid to come</p>

<p>for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Where learned you that oath, fool?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Of a certain knight that swore by his</p>

<p>honor they were good pancakes, and swore by his</p>

<p>honor the mustard was naught. Now, I’ll stand to it,</p>

<p>the pancakes were naught and the mustard was</p>

<p>good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  How prove you that in the great heap of your</p>

<p>knowledge?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Stand you both forth now: stroke your</p>

<p>chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  By our beards (if we had them), thou art.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  By my knavery (if I had it), then I were.</p>

<p>But if you swear by that that is not, you are not</p>

<p>forsworn. No more was this knight swearing by his</p>

<p>honor, for he never had any, or if he had, he had</p>

<p>sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or</p>

<p>that mustard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Prithee, who is ’t that thou mean’st?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  One that old Frederick, your father, loves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  My father’s love is enough to honor him.</p>

<p>Enough. Speak no more of him; you’ll be whipped</p>

<p>for taxation one of these days.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  The more pity that fools may not speak</p>

<p>wisely what wise men do foolishly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  By my troth, thou sayest true. For, since the little</p>

<p>wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery</p>

<p>that wise men have makes a great show. Here</p>

<p>comes Monsieur Le Beau.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Le Beau.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  With his mouth full of news.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their</p>

<p>young.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Then shall we be news-crammed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  All the better. We shall be the more</p>

<p>marketable.–Bonjour, Monsieur Le Beau. What’s</p>

<p>the news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc>  Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Sport? Of what color?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc>  What color, madam? How shall I answer you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  As wit and fortune will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Or as the destinies decrees.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Well said. That was laid on with a trowel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Nay, if I keep not my rank–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Thou losest thy old smell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc>  You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of</p>

<p>good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc>  I will tell you the beginning, and if it please</p>

<p>your Ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is</p>

<p>yet to do, and here, where you are, they are coming</p>

<p>to perform it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc>  There comes an old man and his three sons–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  I could match this beginning with an old tale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc>  Three proper young men of excellent growth</p>

<p>and presence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  With bills on their necks: “Be it known unto</p>

<p>all men by these presents.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc>  The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles,</p>

<p>the Duke’s wrestler, which Charles in a moment</p>

<p>threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is</p>

<p>little hope of life in him. So he served the second,</p>

<p>and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man</p>

<p>their father making such pitiful dole over them that</p>

<p>all the beholders take his part with weeping.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Alas!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  But what is the sport, monsieur, that the</p>

<p>ladies have lost?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc>  Why, this that I speak of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is</p>

<p>the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was</p>

<p>sport for ladies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Or I, I promise thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  But is there any else longs to see this broken</p>

<p>music in his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon</p>

<p>rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc>  You must if you stay here, for here is the place</p>

<p>appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to</p>

<p>perform it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Yonder sure they are coming. Let us now stay</p>

<p>and see it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter Duke Frederick, Lords, Orlando,</p>

<p>Charles, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Frederick</sc>  Come on. Since the youth will not be</p>

<p>entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[to Le Beau]</i>  Is yonder the man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc>  Even he, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Alas, he is too young. Yet he looks successfully.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Frederick</sc>  How now, daughter and cousin? Are</p>

<p>you crept hither to see the wrestling?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Frederick</sc>  You will take little delight in it, I can</p>

<p>tell you, there is such odds in the man. In pity of the</p>

<p>challenger’s youth, I would fain dissuade him, but</p>

<p>he will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if</p>

<p>you can move him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Frederick</sc>  Do so. I’ll not be by.</p>

<p><center><i>[He steps aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc> <i>[to Orlando]</i>  Monsieur the challenger, the</p>

<p>Princess calls for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  I attend them with all respect and duty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Young man, have you challenged Charles the</p>

<p>wrestler?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  No, fair princess. He is the general challenger.</p>

<p>I come but in as others do, to try with him the</p>

<p>strength of my youth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for</p>

<p>your years. You have seen cruel proof of this man’s</p>

<p>strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew</p>

<p>yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure</p>

<p>would counsel you to a more equal enterprise.</p>

<p>We pray you for your own sake to embrace your</p>

<p>own safety and give over this attempt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Do, young sir. Your reputation shall not</p>

<p>therefore be misprized. We will make it our suit to</p>

<p>the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  I beseech you, punish me not with your hard</p>

<p>thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty to deny</p>

<p>so fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your</p>

<p>fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial,</p>

<p>wherein, if I be foiled, there is but one shamed that</p>

<p>was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is</p>

<p>willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for</p>

<p>I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for</p>

<p>in it I have nothing. Only in the world I fill up a</p>

<p>place which may be better supplied when I have</p>

<p>made it empty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  The little strength that I have, I would it</p>

<p>were with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  And mine, to eke out hers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceived in</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Your heart’s desires be with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc>  Come, where is this young gallant that is so</p>

<p>desirous to lie with his mother Earth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more</p>

<p>modest working.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Frederick</sc> <i>[coming forward]</i>  You shall try but</p>

<p>one fall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc>  No, I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat</p>

<p>him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded</p>

<p>him from a first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  You mean to mock me after, you should not</p>

<p>have mocked me before. But come your ways.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  I would I were invisible, to catch the strong</p>

<p>fellow by the leg.</p>

<p><center><i>[Orlando and Charles wrestle.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  O excellent young man!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who</p>

<p>should down.</p>

<p><center><i>[Orlando throws Charles. Shout.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Frederick</sc>  No more, no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Yes, I beseech your Grace. I am not yet well</p>

<p>breathed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Frederick</sc>  How dost thou, Charles?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc>  He cannot speak, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Frederick</sc>  Bear him away.</p>

<p><center><i>[Charles is carried off by Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<p>What is thy name, young man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir</p>

<p>Rowland de Boys.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Frederick</sc></p>

<p>I would thou hadst been son to some man else.</p>

<p>The world esteemed thy father honorable,</p>

<p>But I did find him still mine enemy.</p>

<p>Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this</p>

<p>deed</p>

<p>Hadst thou descended from another house.</p>

<p>But fare thee well. Thou art a gallant youth.</p>

<p>I would thou hadst told me of another father.</p>

<p><center><i>[Duke exits with Touchstone, Le Beau,</p>

<p>Lords, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc> <i>[to Rosalind]</i></p>

<p>Were I my father, coz, would I do this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc></p>

<p>I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son,</p>

<p>His youngest son, and would not change that calling</p>

<p>To be adopted heir to Frederick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[to Celia]</i></p>

<p>My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,</p>

<p>And all the world was of my father’s mind.</p>

<p>Had I before known this young man his son,</p>

<p>I should have given him tears unto entreaties</p>

<p>Ere he should thus have ventured.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Gentle cousin,</p>

<p>Let us go thank him and encourage him.</p>

<p>My father’s rough and envious disposition</p>

<p>Sticks me at heart.–Sir, you have well deserved.</p>

<p>If you do keep your promises in love</p>

<p>But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,</p>

<p>Your mistress shall be happy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[giving Orlando a chain from her neck]</i></p>

<p>Gentleman,</p>

<p>Wear this for me–one out of suits with Fortune,</p>

<p>That could give more but that her hand lacks</p>

<p>means.–</p>

<p>Shall we go, coz?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Ay.–Fare you well, fair gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Can I not say “I thank you”? My better parts</p>

<p>Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up</p>

<p>Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[to Celia]</i></p>

<p>He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes.</p>

<p>I’ll ask him what he would.–Did you call, sir?</p>

<p>Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown</p>

<p>More than your enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  Will you go, coz?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Have with you. <i>[To Orlando.]</i> Fare you well.</p>

<p><center><i>[Rosalind and Celia exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc></p>

<p>What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?</p>

<p>I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.</p>

<p>O poor Orlando! Thou art overthrown.</p>

<p>Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Le Beau.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc></p>

<p>Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you</p>

<p>To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved</p>

<p>High commendation, true applause, and love,</p>

<p>Yet such is now the Duke’s condition</p>

<p>That he misconsters all that you have done.</p>

<p>The Duke is humorous. What he is indeed</p>

<p>More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc></p>

<p>I thank you, sir, and pray you tell me this:</p>

<p>Which of the two was daughter of the duke</p>

<p>That here was at the wrestling?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Le</sc> <sc>Beau</sc></p>

<p>Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,</p>

<p>But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter.</p>

<p>The other is daughter to the banished duke,</p>

<p>And here detained by her usurping uncle</p>

<p>To keep his daughter company, whose loves</p>

<p>Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.</p>

<p>But I can tell you that of late this duke</p>

<p>Hath ta’en displeasure ’gainst his gentle niece,</p>

<p>Grounded upon no other argument</p>

<p>But that the people praise her for her virtues</p>

<p>And pity her for her good father’s sake;</p>

<p>And, on my life, his malice ’gainst the lady</p>

<p>Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.</p>

<p>Hereafter, in a better world than this,</p>

<p>I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc></p>

<p>I rest much bounden to you. Fare you well.</p>

<p><center><i>[Le Beau exits.]</i></center></p>
