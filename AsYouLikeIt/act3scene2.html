<p><center><i>[Enter Orlando, with a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span></p>

<p>Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love.</p>

<p>   <i>And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey</i></p>

<p>With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,</p>

<p>   <i>Thy huntress’ name that my full life doth sway.</i></p>

<p>O Rosalind, these trees shall be my books,</p>

<p>   <i>And in their barks my thoughts I’ll character,</i></p>

<p>That every eye which in this forest looks</p>

<p>   <i>Shall see thy virtue witnessed everywhere.</i></p>

<p>Run, run, Orlando, carve on every tree</p>

<p>The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Corin and Touchstone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master</p>

<p>Touchstone?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a</p>

<p>good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it</p>

<p>is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very</p>

<p>well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile</p>

<p>life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me</p>

<p>well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is</p>

<p>tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my</p>

<p>humor well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it</p>

<p>goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy</p>

<p>in thee, shepherd?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  No more but that I know the more one sickens,</p>

<p>the worse at ease he is, and that he that wants</p>

<p>money, means, and content is without three good</p>

<p>friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire</p>

<p>to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that</p>

<p>a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he</p>

<p>that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may</p>

<p>complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull</p>

<p>kindred.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast</p>

<p>ever in court, shepherd?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  No, truly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Then thou art damned.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  Nay, I hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted</p>

<p>egg, all on one side.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  For not being at court? Your reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Why, if thou never wast at court, thou</p>

<p>never saw’st good manners; if thou never saw’st</p>

<p>good manners, then thy manners must be wicked,</p>

<p>and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou</p>

<p>art in a parlous state, shepherd.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good</p>

<p>manners at the court are as ridiculous in the</p>

<p>country as the behavior of the country is most</p>

<p>mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at</p>

<p>the court but you kiss your hands. That courtesy</p>

<p>would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Instance, briefly. Come, instance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their</p>

<p>fells, you know, are greasy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat?</p>

<p>And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as</p>

<p>the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better</p>

<p>instance, I say. Come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  Besides, our hands are hard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow</p>

<p>again. A more sounder instance. Come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  And they are often tarred over with the surgery</p>

<p>of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The</p>

<p>courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Most shallow man. Thou worms’ meat in</p>

<p>respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed. Learn of the</p>

<p>wise and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar,</p>

<p>the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance,</p>

<p>shepherd.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  You have too courtly a wit for me. I’ll rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee,</p>

<p>shallow man. God make incision in thee; thou art</p>

<p>raw.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  Sir, I am a true laborer. I earn that I eat, get that</p>

<p>I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man’s happiness,</p>

<p>glad of other men’s good, content with my harm,</p>

<p>and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze</p>

<p>and my lambs suck.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  That is another simple sin in you, to bring</p>

<p>the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get</p>

<p>your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to</p>

<p>a bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth</p>

<p>to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of</p>

<p>all reasonable match. If thou be’st not damned for</p>

<p>this, the devil himself will have no shepherds. I</p>

<p>cannot see else how thou shouldst ’scape.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Rosalind, as Ganymede.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new</p>

<p>mistress’s brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede, reading a paper]</i></p>

<p>     <i>From the east to western Ind</i></p>

<p>     <i>No jewel is like Rosalind.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Her worth being mounted on the wind,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Through all the world bears Rosalind.</i></p>

<p>     <i>All the pictures fairest lined</i></p>

<p>     <i>Are but black to Rosalind.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Let no face be kept in mind</i></p>

<p>     <i>But the fair of Rosalind.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  I’ll rhyme you so eight years together,</p>

<p>dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted.</p>

<p>It is the right butter-women’s rank to market.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Out, fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  For a taste:</p>

<p>     <i>If a hart do lack a hind,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Let him seek out Rosalind.</i></p>

<p>     <i>If the cat will after kind,</i></p>

<p>     <i>So be sure will Rosalind.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Wintered garments must be lined;</i></p>

<p>     <i>So must slender Rosalind.</i></p>

<p>     <i>They that reap must sheaf and bind;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Then to cart with Rosalind.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Sweetest nut hath sourest rind;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Such a nut is Rosalind.</i></p>

<p>     <i>He that sweetest rose will find</i></p>

<p>     <i>Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind.</i></p>

<p>This is the very false gallop of verses. Why do you</p>

<p>infect yourself with them?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Peace, you dull fool. I found</p>

<p>them on a tree.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  I’ll graft it with you, and</p>

<p>then I shall graft it with a medlar. Then it will be</p>

<p>the earliest fruit i’ th’ country, for you’ll be rotten</p>

<p>ere you be half ripe, and that’s the right virtue of</p>

<p>the medlar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  You have said, but whether wisely or no,</p>

<p>let the forest judge.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Celia, as Aliena, with a writing.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Peace. Here comes my sister</p>

<p>reading. Stand aside.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena, reads]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Why should this a desert be?</i></p>

<p>        <i>For it is unpeopled? No.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Tongues I’ll hang on every tree</i></p>

<p>        <i>That shall civil sayings show.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Some how brief the life of man</i></p>

<p>        <i>Runs his erring pilgrimage,</i></p>

<p>     <i>That the stretching of a span</i></p>

<p>        <i>Buckles in his sum of age;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Some of violated vows</i></p>

<p>        <i>’Twixt the souls of friend and friend.</i></p>

<p>     <i>But upon the fairest boughs,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Or at every sentence’ end,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Will I “Rosalinda” write,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Teaching all that read to know</i></p>

<p>     <i>The quintessence of every sprite</i></p>

<p>        <i>Heaven would in little show.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Therefore heaven nature charged</i></p>

<p>        <i>That one body should be filled</i></p>

<p>     <i>With all graces wide-enlarged.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Nature presently distilled</i></p>

<p>     <i>Helen’s cheek, but not her heart,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Cleopatra’s majesty,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Atalanta’s better part,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Sad Lucretia’s modesty.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Thus Rosalind of many parts</i></p>

<p>        <i>By heavenly synod was devised</i></p>

<p>     <i>Of many faces, eyes, and hearts</i></p>

<p>        <i>To have the touches dearest prized.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Heaven would that she these gifts should have</i></p>

<p>     <i>And I to live and die her slave.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  O most gentle Jupiter, what</p>

<p>tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners</p>

<p>withal, and never cried “Have patience,</p>

<p>good people!”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i>  How now?–Back, friends. Shepherd,</p>

<p>go off a little.–Go with him, sirrah.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Come, shepherd, let us make an honorable</p>

<p>retreat, though not with bag and baggage, yet</p>

<p>with scrip and scrippage.</p>

<p><center><i>[Touchstone and Corin exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Didst thou hear these verses?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  O yes, I heard them all, and more too, for</p>

<p>some of them had in them more feet than the verses</p>

<p>would bear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  That’s no matter. The feet might bear the verses.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Ay, but the feet were lame and could not</p>

<p>bear themselves without the verse, and therefore</p>

<p>stood lamely in the verse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  But didst thou hear without wondering how thy</p>

<p>name should be hanged and carved upon these</p>

<p>trees?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  I was seven of the nine days out of the</p>

<p>wonder before you came, for look here what I</p>

<p>found on a palm tree. <i>[She shows the paper she</p>

<p>read.]</i> I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras’</p>

<p>time that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly</p>

<p>remember.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Trow you who hath done this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Is it a man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.</p>

<p>Change you color?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  I prithee, who?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to</p>

<p>meet, but mountains may be removed with earthquakes</p>

<p>and so encounter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Nay, but who is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Is it possible?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary</p>

<p>vehemence, tell me who it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful</p>

<p>wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that</p>

<p>out of all whooping!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Good my complexion, dost thou think</p>

<p>though I am caparisoned like a man, I have a</p>

<p>doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of</p>

<p>delay more is a South Sea of discovery. I prithee,</p>

<p>tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would</p>

<p>thou couldst stammer, that thou might’st pour this</p>

<p>concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out</p>

<p>of a narrow-mouthed bottle–either too much at</p>

<p>once, or none at all. I prithee take the cork out of</p>

<p>thy mouth, that I may drink thy tidings.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  So you may put a man in your belly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Is he of God’s making? What manner of</p>

<p>man? Is his head worth a hat, or his chin worth a</p>

<p>beard?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Nay, he hath but a little beard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Why, God will send more, if the man will be</p>

<p>thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if</p>

<p>thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s</p>

<p>heels and your heart both in an instant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Nay, but the devil take mocking. Speak sad</p>

<p>brow and true maid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  I’ faith, coz, ’tis he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Orlando?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Orlando.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet</p>

<p>and hose? What did he when thou saw’st him? What</p>

<p>said he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What</p>

<p>makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where remains</p>

<p>he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou</p>

<p>see him again? Answer me in one word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  You must borrow me Gargantua’s mouth first.</p>

<p>’Tis a word too great for any mouth of this age’s size.</p>

<p>To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to</p>

<p>answer in a catechism.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  But doth he know that I am in this forest and</p>

<p>in man’s apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the</p>

<p>day he wrestled?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the</p>

<p>propositions of a lover. But take a taste of my</p>

<p>finding him, and relish it with good observance. I</p>

<p>found him under a tree like a dropped acorn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  It may well be called Jove’s tree when it</p>

<p>drops forth such fruit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Give me audience, good madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  There lay he, stretched along like a wounded</p>

<p>knight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well</p>

<p>becomes the ground.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Cry “holla” to thy tongue, I prithee. It curvets</p>

<p>unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  O, ominous! He comes to kill my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  I would sing my song without a burden. Thou</p>

<p>bring’st me out of tune.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Do you not know I am a woman? When I</p>

<p>think, I must speak. Sweet, say on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  You bring me out.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Orlando and Jaques.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Soft, comes he not here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  ’Tis he. Slink by, and note him.</p>

<p><center><i>[Rosalind and Celia step aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  God be wi’ you. Let’s meet as little as we can.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  Rosalind is your love’s name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Yes, just.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  I do not like her name.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  There was no thought of pleasing you when</p>

<p>she was christened.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  What stature is she of?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Just as high as my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  You are full of pretty answers. Have you not</p>

<p>been acquainted with goldsmiths’ wives and</p>

<p>conned them out of rings?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Not so. But I answer you right painted cloth,</p>

<p>from whence you have studied your questions.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  You have a nimble wit. I think ’twas made of</p>

<p>Atalanta’s heels. Will you sit down with me? And we</p>

<p>two will rail against our mistress the world and all</p>

<p>our misery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I will chide no breather in the world but</p>

<p>myself, against whom I know most faults.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  The worst fault you have is to be in love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  ’Tis a fault I will not change for your best</p>

<p>virtue. I am weary of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I</p>

<p>found you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  He is drowned in the brook. Look but in, and</p>

<p>you shall see him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  There I shall see mine own figure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  I’ll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I am glad of your departure. Adieu, good</p>

<p>Monsieur Melancholy.     <i><i>[Jaques exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[aside to Celia]</i>  I will speak to him like a</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Very well. What would you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  You should ask me what time o’ day. There’s</p>

<p>no clock in the forest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  And why not the swift foot of time? Had not</p>

<p>that been as proper?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  By no means, sir. Time</p>

<p>travels in divers paces with divers persons. I’ll tell</p>

<p>who time gallops withal, and who he stands still</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I prithee, who doth he trot withal?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Marry, he trots hard with a</p>

<p>young maid between the contract of her marriage</p>

<p>and the day it is solemnized. If the interim be but a</p>

<p>se’nnight, time’s pace is so hard that it seems the</p>

<p>length of seven year.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Who ambles time withal?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  With a priest that lacks Latin</p>

<p>and a rich man that hath not the gout, for the one</p>

<p>sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other</p>

<p>lives merrily because he feels no pain–the one</p>

<p>lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning,</p>

<p>the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious</p>

<p>penury. These time ambles withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Who doth he gallop withal?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  With a thief to the gallows,</p>

<p>for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks</p>

<p>himself too soon there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Who stays it still withal?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  With lawyers in the vacation,</p>

<p>for they sleep between term and term, and</p>

<p>then they perceive not how time moves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Where dwell you, pretty youth?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  With this shepherdess, my</p>

<p>sister, here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe</p>

<p>upon a petticoat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Are you native of this place?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  As the cony that you see</p>

<p>dwell where she is kindled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Your accent is something finer than you</p>

<p>could purchase in so removed a dwelling.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  I have been told so of many.</p>

<p>But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught</p>

<p>me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man,</p>

<p>one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in</p>

<p>love. I have heard him read many lectures against it,</p>

<p>and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched</p>

<p>with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally</p>

<p>taxed their whole sex withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Can you remember any of the principal evils</p>

<p>that he laid to the charge of women?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  There were none principal.</p>

<p>They were all like one another as halfpence are,</p>

<p>every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow</p>

<p>fault came to match it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I prithee recount some of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  No, I will not cast away my</p>

<p>physic but on those that are sick. There is a man</p>

<p>haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with</p>

<p>carving “Rosalind” on their barks, hangs odes upon</p>

<p>hawthorns and elegies on brambles, all, forsooth,</p>

<p>deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet</p>

<p>that fancy-monger, I would give him some good</p>

<p>counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love</p>

<p>upon him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell</p>

<p>me your remedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  There is none of my uncle’s</p>

<p>marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man</p>

<p>in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are</p>

<p>not prisoner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  What were his marks?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  A lean cheek, which you</p>

<p>have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have</p>

<p>not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a</p>

<p>beard neglected, which you have not–but I pardon</p>

<p>you for that, for simply your having in beard is a</p>

<p>younger brother’s revenue. Then your hose should</p>

<p>be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve</p>

<p>unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything</p>

<p>about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But</p>

<p>you are no such man. You are rather point-device in</p>

<p>your accouterments, as loving yourself than seeming</p>

<p>the lover of any other.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe</p>

<p>I love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Me believe it? You may as</p>

<p>soon make her that you love believe it, which I</p>

<p>warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does.</p>

<p>That is one of the points in the which women still</p>

<p>give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth,</p>

<p>are you he that hangs the verses on the trees</p>

<p>wherein Rosalind is so admired?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of</p>

<p>Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  But are you so much in love</p>

<p>as your rhymes speak?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Neither rhyme nor reason can express how</p>

<p>much.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Love is merely a madness,</p>

<p>and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a</p>

<p>whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are</p>

<p>not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so</p>

<p>ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I</p>

<p>profess curing it by counsel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Did you ever cure any so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Yes, one, and in this manner.</p>

<p>He was to imagine me his love, his mistress,</p>

<p>and I set him every day to woo me; at which time</p>

<p>would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be</p>

<p>effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud,</p>

<p>fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears,</p>

<p>full of smiles; for every passion something, and for</p>

<p>no passion truly anything, as boys and women are,</p>

<p>for the most part, cattle of this color; would now</p>

<p>like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then</p>

<p>forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him,</p>

<p>that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love</p>

<p>to a living humor of madness, which was to forswear</p>

<p>the full stream of the world and to live in a</p>

<p>nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and</p>

<p>this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as</p>

<p>clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not</p>

<p>be one spot of love in ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I would not be cured, youth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  I would cure you if you</p>

<p>would but call me Rosalind and come every day to</p>

<p>my cote and woo me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me</p>

<p>where it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Go with me to it, and I’ll</p>

<p>show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where</p>

<p>in the forest you live. Will you go?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  With all my heart, good youth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Nay, you must call me</p>

<p>Rosalind.–Come, sister, will you go?</p>
