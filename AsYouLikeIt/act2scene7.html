<p><center><i>[Enter Duke Senior and Lords, like outlaws.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc></p>

<p>I think he be transformed into a beast,</p>

<p>For I can nowhere find him like a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>My lord, he is but even now gone hence.</p>

<p>Here was he merry, hearing of a song.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc></p>

<p>If he, compact of jars, grow musical,</p>

<p>We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.</p>

<p>Go seek him. Tell him I would speak with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Jaques.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>He saves my labor by his own approach.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc> <i>[to Jaques]</i></p>

<p>Why, how now, monsieur? What a life is this</p>

<p>That your poor friends must woo your company?</p>

<p>What, you look merrily.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc></p>

<p>A fool, a fool, I met a fool i’ th’ forest,</p>

<p>A motley fool. A miserable world!</p>

<p>As I do live by food, I met a fool,</p>

<p>Who laid him down and basked him in the sun</p>

<p>And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,</p>

<p>In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.</p>

<p>“Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he,</p>

<p>“Call me not ’fool’ till heaven hath sent me</p>

<p>fortune.”</p>

<p>And then he drew a dial from his poke</p>

<p>And, looking on it with lack-luster eye,</p>

<p>Says very wisely “It is ten o’clock.</p>

<p>Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.</p>

<p>’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,</p>

<p>And after one hour more ’twill be eleven.</p>

<p>And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,</p>

<p>And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,</p>

<p>And thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hear</p>

<p>The motley fool thus moral on the time,</p>

<p>My lungs began to crow like chanticleer</p>

<p>That fools should be so deep-contemplative,</p>

<p>And I did laugh sans intermission</p>

<p>An hour by his dial. O noble fool!</p>

<p>A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc>  What fool is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc></p>

<p>O worthy fool!–One that hath been a courtier,</p>

<p>And says “If ladies be but young and fair,</p>

<p>They have the gift to know it.” And in his brain,</p>

<p>Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit</p>

<p>After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed</p>

<p>With observation, the which he vents</p>

<p>In mangled forms. O, that I were a fool!</p>

<p>I am ambitious for a motley coat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc></p>

<p>Thou shalt have one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc>  It is my only suit,</p>

<p>Provided that you weed your better judgments</p>

<p>Of all opinion that grows rank in them</p>

<p>That I am wise. I must have liberty</p>

<p>Withal, as large a charter as the wind,</p>

<p>To blow on whom I please, for so fools have.</p>

<p>And they that are most galled with my folly,</p>

<p>They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?</p>

<p>The “why” is plain as way to parish church:</p>

<p>He that a fool doth very wisely hit</p>

<p>Doth very foolishly, although he smart,</p>

<p>Not to seem senseless of the bob. If not,</p>

<p>The wise man’s folly is anatomized</p>

<p>Even by the squand’ring glances of the fool.</p>

<p>Invest me in my motley. Give me leave</p>

<p>To speak my mind, and I will through and through</p>

<p>Cleanse the foul body of th’ infected world,</p>

<p>If they will patiently receive my medicine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc></p>

<p>Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc></p>

<p>What, for a counter, would I do but good?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc></p>

<p>Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin;</p>

<p>For thou thyself hast been a libertine,</p>

<p>As sensual as the brutish sting itself,</p>

<p>And all th’ embossed sores and headed evils</p>

<p>That thou with license of free foot hast caught</p>

<p>Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc>  Why, who cries out on pride</p>

<p>That can therein tax any private party?</p>

<p>Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea</p>

<p>Till that the weary very means do ebb?</p>

<p>What woman in the city do I name</p>

<p>When that I say the city-woman bears</p>

<p>The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?</p>

<p>Who can come in and say that I mean her,</p>

<p>When such a one as she such is her neighbor?</p>

<p>Or what is he of basest function</p>

<p>That says his bravery is not on my cost,</p>

<p>Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits</p>

<p>His folly to the mettle of my speech?</p>

<p>There then. How then, what then? Let me see</p>

<p>wherein</p>

<p>My tongue hath wronged him. If it do him right,</p>

<p>Then he hath wronged himself. If he be free,</p>

<p>Why then my taxing like a wild goose flies</p>

<p>Unclaimed of any man.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Orlando, brandishing a sword.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Forbear, and eat no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc>  Why, I have eat none yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc></p>

<p>Nor shalt not till necessity be served.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc>  Of what kind should this cock come of?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc> <i>[to Orlando]</i></p>

<p>Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress,</p>

<p>Or else a rude despiser of good manners,</p>

<p>That in civility thou seem’st so empty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc></p>

<p>You touched my vein at first. The thorny point</p>

<p>Of bare distress hath ta’en from me the show</p>

<p>Of smooth civility, yet am I inland bred</p>

<p>And know some nurture. But forbear, I say.</p>

<p>He dies that touches any of this fruit</p>

<p>Till I and my affairs are answered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc>  An you will not be answered with reason, I</p>

<p>must die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc> <i>[to Orlando]</i></p>

<p>What would you have? Your gentleness shall force</p>

<p>More than your force move us to gentleness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc></p>

<p>I almost die for food, and let me have it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc></p>

<p>Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc></p>

<p>Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you.</p>

<p>I thought that all things had been savage here,</p>

<p>And therefore put I on the countenance</p>

<p>Of stern commandment. But whate’er you are</p>

<p>That in this desert inaccessible,</p>

<p>Under the shade of melancholy boughs,</p>

<p>Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time,</p>

<p>If ever you have looked on better days,</p>

<p>If ever been where bells have knolled to church,</p>

<p>If ever sat at any good man’s feast,</p>

<p>If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear</p>

<p>And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied,</p>

<p>Let gentleness my strong enforcement be,</p>

<p>In the which hope I blush and hide my sword.</p>

<p><center><i>[He sheathes his sword.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc></p>

<p>True is it that we have seen better days,</p>

<p>And have with holy bell been knolled to church,</p>

<p>And sat at good men’s feasts and wiped our eyes</p>

<p>Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered.</p>

<p>And therefore sit you down in gentleness,</p>

<p>And take upon command what help we have</p>

<p>That to your wanting may be ministered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc></p>

<p>Then but forbear your food a little while</p>

<p>Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn</p>

<p>And give it food. There is an old poor man</p>

<p>Who after me hath many a weary step</p>

<p>Limped in pure love. Till he be first sufficed,</p>

<p>Oppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger,</p>

<p>I will not touch a bit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc>  Go find him out,</p>

<p>And we will nothing waste till you return.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc></p>

<p>I thank you; and be blessed for your good comfort.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc></p>

<p>Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.</p>

<p>This wide and universal theater</p>

<p>Presents more woeful pageants than the scene</p>

<p>Wherein we play in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc>  All the world’s a stage,</p>

<p>And all the men and women merely players.</p>

<p>They have their exits and their entrances,</p>

<p>And one man in his time plays many parts,</p>

<p>His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</p>

<p>Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.</p>

<p>Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel</p>

<p>And shining morning face, creeping like snail</p>

<p>Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</p>

<p>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</p>

<p>Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,</p>

<p>Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,</p>

<p>Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,</p>

<p>Seeking the bubble reputation</p>

<p>Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,</p>

<p>In fair round belly with good capon lined,</p>

<p>With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</p>

<p>Full of wise saws and modern instances;</p>

<p>And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</p>

<p>Into the lean and slippered pantaloon</p>

<p>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</p>

<p>His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</p>

<p>For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,</p>

<p>Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</p>

<p>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</p>

<p>That ends this strange eventful history,</p>

<p>Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</p>

<p>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Orlando, carrying Adam.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc></p>

<p>Welcome. Set down your venerable burden,</p>

<p>And let him feed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  I thank you most for him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adam</sc>  So had you need.–</p>

<p>I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc></p>

<p>Welcome. Fall to. I will not trouble you</p>

<p>As yet to question you about your fortunes.–</p>

<p>Give us some music, and, good cousin, sing.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The Duke and Orlando continue their conversation,</p>

<p>apart.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>Song.</p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Amiens</sc> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>        <i>Blow, blow, thou winter wind.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Thou art not so unkind</i></p>

<p>           <i>As man’s ingratitude.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Thy tooth is not so keen,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Because thou art not seen,</i></p>

<p>           <i>Although thy breath be rude.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.</i></p>

<p>           <i>Then heigh-ho, the holly.</i></p>

<p>           <i>This life is most jolly.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>        <i>Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,</i></p>

<p>        <i>That dost not bite so nigh</i></p>

<p>           <i>As benefits forgot.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Though thou the waters warp,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Thy sting is not so sharp</i></p>

<p>           <i>As friend remembered not.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.</i></p>

<p>           <i>Then heigh-ho, the holly.</i></p>

<p>           <i>This life is most jolly.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <sc>Senior</sc> <i>[to Orlando]</i></p>

<p>If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son,</p>

<p>As you have whispered faithfully you were,</p>

<p>And as mine eye doth his effigies witness</p>

<p>Most truly limned and living in your face,</p>

<p>Be truly welcome hither. I am the duke</p>

<p>That loved your father. The residue of your fortune</p>

<p>Go to my cave and tell me.–Good old man,</p>

<p>Thou art right welcome as thy master is.</p>

<p><center><i>[To Lords.]</i></center> Support him by the arm. <center><i>[To Orlando.]</i></center></p>
