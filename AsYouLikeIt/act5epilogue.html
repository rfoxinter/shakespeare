<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  It is not the fashion to see the lady the</p>

<p>epilogue, but it is no more unhandsome than to see</p>

<p>the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine</p>

<p>needs no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no</p>

<p>epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes,</p>

<p>and good plays prove the better by the help of good</p>

<p>epilogues. What a case am I in then that am neither</p>

<p>a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in</p>

<p>the behalf of a good play! I am not furnished like a</p>

<p>beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My</p>

<p>way is to conjure you, and I’ll begin with the</p>

<p>women. I charge you, O women, for the love you</p>

<p>bear to men, to like as much of this play as please</p>

<p>you. And I charge you, O men, for the love you bear</p>

<p>to women–as I perceive by your simpering, none</p>

<p>of you hates them–that between you and the</p>

<p>women the play may please. If I were a woman, I</p>

<p>would kiss as many of you as had beards that</p>

<p>pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths</p>

<p>that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have</p>

<p>good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths will for</p>

<p>my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</p>
