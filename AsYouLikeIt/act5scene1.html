<p><center><i>[Enter Touchstone and Audrey.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  We shall find a time, Audrey. Patience,</p>

<p>gentle Audrey.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Audrey</span>  Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the</p>

<p>old gentleman’s saying.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most</p>

<p>vile Martext. But Audrey, there is a youth here in</p>

<p>the forest lays claim to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Audrey</span>  Ay, I know who ’tis. He hath no interest in me</p>

<p>in the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter William.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes the man you mean.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  It is meat and drink to me to see a clown.</p>

<p>By my troth, we that have good wits have much to</p>

<p>answer for. We shall be flouting. We cannot hold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>William</span>  Good ev’n, Audrey.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Audrey</span>  God gi’ good ev’n, William.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>William</span> <i>[to Touchstone]</i>  And good ev’n to you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Good ev’n, gentle friend. Cover thy head,</p>

<p>cover thy head. Nay, prithee, be covered. How old</p>

<p>are you, friend?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>William</span>  Five-and-twenty, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  A ripe age. Is thy name William?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>William</span>  William, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  A fair name. Wast born i’ th’ forest here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>William</span>  Ay, sir, I thank God.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  “Thank God.” A good answer. Art rich?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>William</span>  ’Faith sir, so-so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  “So-so” is good, very good, very excellent</p>

<p>good. And yet it is not: it is but so-so. Art thou wise?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>William</span>  Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Why, thou sayst well. I do now remember</p>

<p>a saying: “The fool doth think he is wise, but the</p>

<p>wise man knows himself to be a fool.” The heathen</p>

<p>philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,</p>

<p>would open his lips when he put it into his mouth,</p>

<p>meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and</p>

<p>lips to open. You do love this maid?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>William</span>  I do, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Give me your hand. Art thou learned?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>William</span>  No, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Then learn this of me: to have is to have.</p>

<p>For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured</p>

<p>out of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth</p>

<p>empty the other. For all your writers do consent</p>

<p>that ipse is “he.” Now, you are not ipse, for I am he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>William</span>  Which he, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  He, sir, that must marry this woman.</p>

<p>Therefore, you clown, abandon–which is in the</p>

<p>vulgar “leave”–the society–which in the boorish</p>

<p>is “company”–of this female–which in the common</p>

<p>is “woman”; which together is, abandon the</p>

<p>society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or,</p>

<p>to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill</p>

<p>thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death,</p>

<p>thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with</p>

<p>thee, or in bastinado, or in steel. I will bandy with</p>

<p>thee in faction. I will o’errun thee with policy. I</p>

<p>will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways. Therefore</p>

<p>tremble and depart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Audrey</span>  Do, good William.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>William</span> <i>[to Touchstone]</i>  God rest you merry, sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Corin.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span>  Our master and mistress seeks you. Come away,</p>

<p>away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Touchstone</span>  Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey.–I attend, I</p>

<p>attend.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
