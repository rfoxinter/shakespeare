<p><center><i>[Enter Orlando, with his arm in a sling, and Oliver.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Is ’t possible that on so little acquaintance</p>

<p>you should like her? That, but seeing, you should</p>

<p>love her? And loving, woo? And wooing, she should</p>

<p>grant? And will you persever to enjoy her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the</p>

<p>poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden</p>

<p>wooing, nor her sudden consenting, but say with</p>

<p>me “I love Aliena”; say with her that she loves me;</p>

<p>consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It</p>

<p>shall be to your good, for my father’s house and all</p>

<p>the revenue that was old Sir Rowland’s will I estate</p>

<p>upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Rosalind, as Ganymede.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  You have my consent. Let your wedding be</p>

<p>tomorrow. Thither will I invite the Duke and all ’s</p>

<p>contented followers. Go you and prepare Aliena,</p>

<p>for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede, to Oliver]</i>  God save you,</p>

<p>brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  And you, fair sister.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  O my dear Orlando, how it</p>

<p>grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  It is my arm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  I thought thy heart had been</p>

<p>wounded with the claws of a lion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Did your brother tell you</p>

<p>how I counterfeited to swoon when he showed me</p>

<p>your handkercher?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Ay, and greater wonders than that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  O, I know where you are.</p>

<p>Nay, ’tis true. There was never anything so sudden</p>

<p>but the fight of two rams, and Caesar’s thrasonical</p>

<p>brag of “I came, saw, and overcame.” For your</p>

<p>brother and my sister no sooner met but they</p>

<p>looked, no sooner looked but they loved, no sooner</p>

<p>loved but they sighed, no sooner sighed but they</p>

<p>asked one another the reason, no sooner knew the</p>

<p>reason but they sought the remedy; and in these</p>

<p>degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage,</p>

<p>which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent</p>

<p>before marriage. They are in the very wrath</p>

<p>of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part</p>

<p>them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  They shall be married tomorrow, and I will</p>

<p>bid the Duke to the nuptial. But O, how bitter a</p>

<p>thing it is to look into happiness through another</p>

<p>man’s eyes. By so much the more shall I tomorrow</p>

<p>be at the height of heart-heaviness by how much I</p>

<p>shall think my brother happy in having what he</p>

<p>wishes for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Why, then, tomorrow I cannot</p>

<p>serve your turn for Rosalind?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  I can live no longer by thinking.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  I will weary you then no</p>

<p>longer with idle talking. Know of me then–for</p>

<p>now I speak to some purpose–that I know you are</p>

<p>a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that</p>

<p>you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge,</p>

<p>insomuch I say I know you are. Neither do I labor</p>

<p>for a greater esteem than may in some little measure</p>

<p>draw a belief from you to do yourself good, and</p>

<p>not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I</p>

<p>can do strange things. I have, since I was three year</p>

<p>old, conversed with a magician, most profound in</p>

<p>his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind</p>

<p>so near the heart as your gesture cries it out,</p>

<p>when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry</p>

<p>her. I know into what straits of fortune she is</p>

<p>driven, and it is not impossible to me, if it appear</p>

<p>not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes</p>

<p>tomorrow, human as she is, and without any</p>

<p>danger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Speak’st thou in sober meanings?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  By my life I do, which I</p>

<p>tender dearly, though I say I am a magician. Therefore</p>

<p>put you in your best array, bid your friends; for</p>

<p>if you will be married tomorrow, you shall, and to</p>

<p>Rosalind, if you will.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Silvius and Phoebe.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of</p>

<p>hers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Phoebe</sc> <i>[to Rosalind]</i></p>

<p>Youth, you have done me much ungentleness</p>

<p>To show the letter that I writ to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>I care not if I have. It is my study</p>

<p>To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.</p>

<p>You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.</p>

<p>Look upon him, love him; he worships you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Phoebe</sc> <i>[to Silvius]</i></p>

<p>Good shepherd, tell this youth what ’tis to love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Silvius</sc></p>

<p>It is to be all made of sighs and tears,</p>

<p>And so am I for Phoebe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Phoebe</sc>  And I for Ganymede.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  And I for Rosalind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  And I for no woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Silvius</sc></p>

<p>It is to be all made of faith and service,</p>

<p>And so am I for Phoebe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Phoebe</sc>  And I for Ganymede.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  And I for Rosalind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  And I for no woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Silvius</sc></p>

<p>It is to be all made of fantasy,</p>

<p>All made of passion and all made of wishes,</p>

<p>All adoration, duty, and observance,</p>

<p>All humbleness, all patience and impatience,</p>

<p>All purity, all trial, all observance,</p>

<p>And so am I for Phoebe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Phoebe</sc>  And so am I for Ganymede.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  And so am I for Rosalind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  And so am I for no</p>

<p>woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Phoebe</sc></p>

<p>If this be so, why blame you me to love you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Silvius</sc></p>

<p>If this be so, why blame you me to love you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc></p>

<p>If this be so, why blame you me to love you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Why do you speak too,</p>

<p>“Why blame you me to love you?”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Pray you, no more of this.</p>

<p>’Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the</p>

<p>moon. <i>[(To Silvius.)]</i> I will help you if I can. <i>[(To</p>

<p>Phoebe.)]</i> I would love you if I could.–Tomorrow</p>

<p>meet me all together. <i>[(To Phoebe.)]</i> I will marry</p>

<p>you if ever I marry woman, and I’ll be married</p>

<p>tomorrow. <i>[(To Orlando.)]</i> I will satisfy you if ever I</p>

<p>satisfy man, and you shall be married tomorrow.</p>

<p><i>[(To Silvius.)]</i> I will content you, if what pleases you</p>

<p>contents you, and you shall be married tomorrow.</p>

<p><i>[(To Orlando.)]</i> As you love Rosalind, meet. <i>[(To</p>

<p>Silvius.)]</i> As you love Phoebe, meet.–And as I love</p>

<p>no woman, I’ll meet. So fare you well. I have left</p>

<p>you commands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Silvius</sc>  I’ll not fail, if I live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Phoebe</sc>  Nor I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Nor I.</p>
