<p><center><i>[Enter Rosalind, dressed as Ganymede, and Celia,</p>

<p>dressed as Aliena.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Never talk to me. I will weep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider</p>

<p>that tears do not become a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  But have I not cause to weep?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  As good cause as one would desire. Therefore</p>

<p>weep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  His very hair is of the dissembling color.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Something browner than Judas’s. Marry, his</p>

<p>kisses are Judas’s own children.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  I’ faith, his hair is of a good color.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  An excellent color. Your chestnut was ever the</p>

<p>only color.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the</p>

<p>touch of holy bread.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A</p>

<p>nun of winter’s sisterhood kisses not more religiously.</p>

<p>The very ice of chastity is in them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  But why did he swear he would come this</p>

<p>morning, and comes not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Do you think so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Yes, I think he is not a pickpurse nor a horse-stealer,</p>

<p>but for his verity in love, I do think him as</p>

<p>concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Not true in love?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  You have heard him swear downright he</p>

<p>was.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  “Was” is not “is.” Besides, the oath of a lover is</p>

<p>no stronger than the word of a tapster. They are</p>

<p>both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends</p>

<p>here in the forest on the Duke your father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  I met the Duke yesterday and had much</p>

<p>question with him. He asked me of what parentage</p>

<p>I was. I told him, of as good as he. So he laughed</p>

<p>and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when</p>

<p>there is such a man as Orlando?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  O, that’s a brave man. He writes brave verses,</p>

<p>speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks</p>

<p>them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of</p>

<p>his lover, as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on</p>

<p>one side breaks his staff like a noble goose; but all’s</p>

<p>brave that youth mounts and folly guides.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Corin.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span></p>

<p>Mistress and master, you have oft inquired</p>

<p>After the shepherd that complained of love,</p>

<p>Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,</p>

<p>Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess</p>

<p>That was his mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i>  Well, and what of him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Corin</span></p>

<p>If you will see a pageant truly played</p>

<p>Between the pale complexion of true love</p>

<p>And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,</p>

<p>Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you</p>

<p>If you will mark it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[aside to Celia]</i>  O come, let us remove.</p>

<p>The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.</p>

<p><i>[As Ganymede, to Corin.]</i> </p>

<p>Bring us to this sight, andyou shall say</p>

<p>I’ll prove a busy actor in their play.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
