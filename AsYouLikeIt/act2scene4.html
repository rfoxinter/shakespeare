<p><center><i>[Enter Rosalind for Ganymede, Celia for Aliena, and</p>

<p>Clown, alias Touchstone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc></p>

<p>O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  I care not for my spirits, if my legs were</p>

<p>not weary.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  I could find in my heart to disgrace my</p>

<p>man’s apparel and to cry like a woman, but I must</p>

<p>comfort the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose</p>

<p>ought to show itself courageous to petticoat. Therefore</p>

<p>courage, good Aliena.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  I pray you bear with me. I cannot go no further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  For my part, I had rather bear with you</p>

<p>than bear you. Yet I should bear no cross if I did</p>

<p>bear you, for I think you have no money in your</p>

<p>purse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Well, this is the Forest of Arden.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I.</p>

<p>When I was at home I was in a better place, but</p>

<p>travelers must be content.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Ay, be so, good Touchstone.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Corin and Silvius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look you who comes here, a young man and an old</p>

<p>in solemn talk.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Rosalind, Celia, and Touchstone step aside and</p>

<p>eavesdrop.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Corin</sc> <i>[to Silvius]</i></p>

<p>That is the way to make her scorn you still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Silvius</sc></p>

<p>O Corin, that thou knew’st how I do love her!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Corin</sc></p>

<p>I partly guess, for I have loved ere now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Silvius</sc></p>

<p>No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,</p>

<p>Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover</p>

<p>As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow.</p>

<p>But if thy love were ever like to mine–</p>

<p>As sure I think did never man love so–</p>

<p>How many actions most ridiculous</p>

<p>Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Corin</sc></p>

<p>Into a thousand that I have forgotten.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Silvius</sc></p>

<p>O, thou didst then never love so heartily.</p>

<p>If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly</p>

<p>That ever love did make thee run into,</p>

<p>Thou hast not loved.</p>

<p>Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,</p>

<p>Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress’ praise,</p>

<p>Thou hast not loved.</p>

<p>Or if thou hast not broke from company</p>

<p>Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,</p>

<p>Thou hast not loved.</p>

<p>O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc></p>

<p>Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound,</p>

<p>I have by hard adventure found mine own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  And I mine. I remember when I was in</p>

<p>love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him</p>

<p>take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I</p>

<p>remember the kissing of her batler, and the cow’s</p>

<p>dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked;</p>

<p>and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of</p>

<p>her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her</p>

<p>them again, said with weeping tears “Wear these for</p>

<p>my sake.” We that are true lovers run into strange</p>

<p>capers. But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature</p>

<p>in love mortal in folly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Nay, I shall ne’er be ware of mine own</p>

<p>wit till I break my shins against it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc></p>

<p>Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion</p>

<p>Is much upon my fashion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  And mine, but it grows something stale</p>

<p>with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc>  I pray you, one of you question yond man, if he</p>

<p>for gold will give us any food. I faint almost to death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc> <i>[to Corin]</i>  Holla, you clown!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc>  Peace, fool. He’s not thy kinsman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Corin</sc>  Who calls?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Your betters, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Corin</sc>  Else are they very wretched.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[to Touchstone]</i></p>

<p>Peace, I say. <i>[As Ganymede, to Corin.]</i></p>

<p> Good even toyou, friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Corin</sc></p>

<p>And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold</p>

<p>Can in this desert place buy entertainment,</p>

<p>Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.</p>

<p>Here’s a young maid with travel much oppressed,</p>

<p>And faints for succor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Corin</sc>  Fair sir, I pity her</p>

<p>And wish for her sake more than for mine own</p>

<p>My fortunes were more able to relieve her.</p>

<p>But I am shepherd to another man</p>

<p>And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.</p>

<p>My master is of churlish disposition</p>

<p>And little recks to find the way to heaven</p>

<p>By doing deeds of hospitality.</p>

<p>Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed</p>

<p>Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,</p>

<p>By reason of his absence, there is nothing</p>

<p>That you will feed on. But what is, come see,</p>

<p>And in my voice most welcome shall you be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Corin</sc></p>

<p>That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,</p>

<p>That little cares for buying anything.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosalind</sc> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,</p>

<p>Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,</p>

<p>And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Celia</sc> <i>[as Aliena]</i></p>

<p>And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,</p>

<p>And willingly could waste my time in it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Corin</sc></p>

<p>Assuredly the thing is to be sold.</p>

<p>Go with me. If you like upon report</p>

<p>The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,</p>

<p>I will your very faithful feeder be</p>

<p>And buy it with your gold right suddenly.</p>
