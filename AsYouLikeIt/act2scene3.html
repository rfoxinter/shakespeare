<p><center><i>[Enter Orlando and Adam, meeting.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adam</span></p>

<p>What, my young master, O my gentle master,</p>

<p>O my sweet master, O you memory</p>

<p>Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?</p>

<p>Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?</p>

<p>And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?</p>

<p>Why would you be so fond to overcome</p>

<p>The bonny prizer of the humorous duke?</p>

<p>Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.</p>

<p>Know you not, master, to some kind of men</p>

<p>Their graces serve them but as enemies?</p>

<p>No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,</p>

<p>Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.</p>

<p>O, what a world is this when what is comely</p>

<p>Envenoms him that bears it!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Why, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adam</span>  O unhappy youth,</p>

<p>Come not within these doors. Within this roof</p>

<p>The enemy of all your graces lives.</p>

<p>Your brother–no, no brother–yet the son–</p>

<p>Yet not the son, I will not call him son–</p>

<p>Of him I was about to call his father,</p>

<p>Hath heard your praises, and this night he means</p>

<p>To burn the lodging where you use to lie,</p>

<p>And you within it. If he fail of that,</p>

<p>He will have other means to cut you off.</p>

<p>I overheard him and his practices.</p>

<p>This is no place, this house is but a butchery.</p>

<p>Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span></p>

<p>Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adam</span></p>

<p>No matter whither, so you come not here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span></p>

<p>What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,</p>

<p>Or with a base and boist’rous sword enforce</p>

<p>A thievish living on the common road?</p>

<p>This I must do, or know not what to do;</p>

<p>Yet this I will not do, do how I can.</p>

<p>I rather will subject me to the malice</p>

<p>Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adam</span></p>

<p>But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,</p>

<p>The thrifty hire I saved under your father,</p>

<p>Which I did store to be my foster nurse</p>

<p>When service should in my old limbs lie lame,</p>

<p>And unregarded age in corners thrown.</p>

<p>Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,</p>

<p>Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,</p>

<p>Be comfort to my age. Here is the gold.</p>

<p>All this I give you. Let me be your servant.</p>

<p>Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,</p>

<p>For in my youth I never did apply</p>

<p>Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,</p>

<p>Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo</p>

<p>The means of weakness and debility.</p>

<p>Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,</p>

<p>Frosty but kindly. Let me go with you.</p>

<p>I’ll do the service of a younger man</p>

<p>In all your business and necessities.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span></p>

<p>O good old man, how well in thee appears</p>

<p>The constant service of the antique world,</p>

<p>When service sweat for duty, not for meed.</p>

<p>Thou art not for the fashion of these times,</p>

<p>Where none will sweat but for promotion,</p>

<p>And having that do choke their service up</p>

<p>Even with the having. It is not so with thee.</p>

<p>But, poor old man, thou prun’st a rotten tree</p>

<p>That cannot so much as a blossom yield</p>

<p>In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.</p>

<p>But come thy ways. We’ll go along together,</p>

<p>And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,</p>

<p>We’ll light upon some settled low content.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adam</span></p>

<p>Master, go on, and I will follow thee</p>

<p>To the last gasp with truth and loyalty.</p>

<p>From seventeen years till now almost fourscore</p>

<p>Here lived I, but now live here no more.</p>

<p>At seventeen years, many their fortunes seek,</p>

<p>But at fourscore, it is too late a week.</p>

<p>Yet fortune cannot recompense me better</p>

<p>Than to die well, and not my master’s debtor.</p>
