<p><center><i>[Enter Rosalind dressed as Ganymede and Celia</p>

<p>dressed as Aliena.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  How say you now? Is it not past two o’clock?</p>

<p>And here much Orlando.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain</p>

<p>he hath ta’en his bow and arrows and is gone forth</p>

<p>to sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Silvius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look who comes here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span> <i>[to Rosalind]</i></p>

<p>My errand is to you, fair youth.</p>

<p>My gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives Rosalind a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>I know not the contents, but as I guess</p>

<p>By the stern brow and waspish action</p>

<p>Which she did use as she was writing of it,</p>

<p>It bears an angry tenor. Pardon me.</p>

<p>I am but as a guiltless messenger.</p>

<p><center><i>[Rosalind reads the letter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>Patience herself would startle at this letter</p>

<p>And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.</p>

<p>She says I am not fair, that I lack manners.</p>

<p>She calls me proud, and that she could not love me</p>

<p>Were man as rare as phoenix. ’Od’s my will,</p>

<p>Her love is not the hare that I do hunt.</p>

<p>Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,</p>

<p>This is a letter of your own device.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span></p>

<p>No, I protest. I know not the contents.</p>

<p>Phoebe did write it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Come, come, you are a</p>

<p>fool,</p>

<p>And turned into the extremity of love.</p>

<p>I saw her hand. She has a leathern hand,</p>

<p>A freestone-colored hand. I verily did think</p>

<p>That her old gloves were on, but ’twas her hands.</p>

<p>She has a huswife’s hand–but that’s no matter.</p>

<p>I say she never did invent this letter.</p>

<p>This is a man’s invention, and his hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span>  Sure it is hers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>Why, ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style,</p>

<p>A style for challengers. Why, she defies me</p>

<p>Like Turk to Christian. Women’s gentle brain</p>

<p>Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,</p>

<p>Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect</p>

<p>Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span></p>

<p>So please you, for I never heard it yet,</p>

<p>Yet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>She Phoebes me. Mark how the tyrant writes.</p>

<p><center><i>[Read.]</i></center></p>

<p>     <i>Art thou god to shepherd turned,</i></p>

<p>     <i>That a maiden’s heart hath burned?</i></p>

<p>Can a woman rail thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span>  Call you this railing?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p><center><i>[Read.]</i></center></p>

<p>     <i>Why, thy godhead laid apart,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?</i></p>

<p>Did you ever hear such railing?</p>

<p>     <i>Whiles the eye of man did woo me,</i></p>

<p>     <i>That could do no vengeance to me.</i></p>

<p>Meaning me a beast.</p>

<p>     <i>If the scorn of your bright eyne</i></p>

<p>     <i>Have power to raise such love in mine,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Alack, in me what strange effect</i></p>

<p>     <i>Would they work in mild aspect?</i></p>

<p>     <i>Whiles you chid me, I did love.</i></p>

<p>     <i>How then might your prayers move?</i></p>

<p>     <i>He that brings this love to thee</i></p>

<p>     <i>Little knows this love in me,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And by him seal up thy mind</i></p>

<p>     <i>Whether that thy youth and kind</i></p>

<p>     <i>Will the faithful offer take</i></p>

<p>     <i>Of me, and all that I can make,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Or else by him my love deny,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And then I’ll study how to die.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span>  Call you this chiding?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i>  Alas, poor shepherd.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Do you pity him? No, he</p>

<p>deserves no pity.–Wilt thou love such a woman?</p>

<p>What, to make thee an instrument and play false</p>

<p>strains upon thee? Not to be endured. Well, go your</p>

<p>way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame</p>

<p>snake, and say this to her: that if she love me, I</p>

<p>charge her to love thee; if she will not, I will never</p>

<p>have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true</p>

<p>lover, hence, and not a word, for here comes more</p>

<p>company.     <i><i>[Silvius exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Oliver.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, fair ones. Pray you, if you know,</p>

<p>Where in the purlieus of this forest stands</p>

<p>A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i></p>

<p>West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom;</p>

<p>The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream</p>

<p>Left on your right hand brings you to the place.</p>

<p>But at this hour the house doth keep itself.</p>

<p>There’s none within.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span></p>

<p>If that an eye may profit by a tongue,</p>

<p>Then should I know you by description–</p>

<p>Such garments, and such years. “The boy is fair,</p>

<p>Of female favor, and bestows himself</p>

<p>Like a ripe sister; the woman low</p>

<p>And browner than her brother.” Are not you</p>

<p>The owner of the house I did inquire for?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i></p>

<p>It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span></p>

<p>Orlando doth commend him to you both,</p>

<p>And to that youth he calls his Rosalind</p>

<p>He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?</p>

<p><center><i>[He shows a stained handkerchief.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>I am. What must we understand by this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span></p>

<p>Some of my shame, if you will know of me</p>

<p>What man I am, and how, and why, and where</p>

<p>This handkercher was stained.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i>  I pray you tell it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span></p>

<p>When last the young Orlando parted from you,</p>

<p>He left a promise to return again</p>

<p>Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,</p>

<p>Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,</p>

<p>Lo, what befell. He threw his eye aside–</p>

<p>And mark what object did present itself:</p>

<p>Under an old oak, whose boughs were mossed with</p>

<p>age</p>

<p>And high top bald with dry antiquity,</p>

<p>A wretched, ragged man, o’ergrown with hair,</p>

<p>Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck</p>

<p>A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,</p>

<p>Who with her head, nimble in threats, approached</p>

<p>The opening of his mouth. But suddenly,</p>

<p>Seeing Orlando, it unlinked itself</p>

<p>And, with indented glides, did slip away</p>

<p>Into a bush, under which bush’s shade</p>

<p>A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,</p>

<p>Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch</p>

<p>When that the sleeping man should stir–for ’tis</p>

<p>The royal disposition of that beast</p>

<p>To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.</p>

<p>This seen, Orlando did approach the man</p>

<p>And found it was his brother, his elder brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i></p>

<p>O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,</p>

<p>And he did render him the most unnatural</p>

<p>That lived amongst men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span>  And well he might so do,</p>

<p>For well I know he was unnatural.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>But to Orlando: did he leave him there,</p>

<p>Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span></p>

<p>Twice did he turn his back and purposed so,</p>

<p>But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,</p>

<p>And nature, stronger than his just occasion,</p>

<p>Made him give battle to the lioness,</p>

<p>Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling,</p>

<p>From miserable slumber I awaked.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i>  Are you his brother?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Was ’t you he rescued?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i></p>

<p>Was ’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span></p>

<p>’Twas I, but ’tis not I. I do not shame</p>

<p>To tell you what I was, since my conversion</p>

<p>So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>But for the bloody napkin?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span>  By and by.</p>

<p>When from the first to last betwixt us two</p>

<p>Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed–</p>

<p>As how I came into that desert place–</p>

<p>In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,</p>

<p>Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,</p>

<p>Committing me unto my brother’s love;</p>

<p>Who led me instantly unto his cave,</p>

<p>There stripped himself, and here upon his arm</p>

<p>The lioness had torn some flesh away,</p>

<p>Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,</p>

<p>And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.</p>

<p>Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound,</p>

<p>And after some small space, being strong at heart,</p>

<p>He sent me hither, stranger as I am,</p>

<p>To tell this story, that you might excuse</p>

<p>His broken promise, and to give this napkin</p>

<p>Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth</p>

<p>That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.</p>

<p><center><i>[Rosalind faints.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i></p>

<p>Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span></p>

<p>Many will swoon when they do look on blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i></p>

<p>There is more in it.–Cousin Ganymede.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span>  Look, he recovers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  I would I were at home.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i>  We’ll lead you thither.–I pray you,</p>

<p>will you take him by the arm?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span> <i>[helping Rosalind to rise]</i>  Be of good cheer,</p>

<p>youth. You a man? You lack a man’s heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  I do so, I confess it. Ah,</p>

<p>sirrah, a body would think this was well-counterfeited.</p>

<p>I pray you tell your brother how well I</p>

<p>counterfeited. Heigh-ho.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span>  This was not counterfeit. There is too great</p>

<p>testimony in your complexion that it was a passion</p>

<p>of earnest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Counterfeit, I assure you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span>  Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to</p>

<p>be a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  So I do; but, i’ faith, I should</p>

<p>have been a woman by right.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i>  Come, you look paler and paler. Pray</p>

<p>you draw homewards.–Good sir, go with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oliver</span></p>

<p>That will I, for I must bear answer back</p>

<p>How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  I shall devise something.</p>

<p>But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him.</p>

<p>Will you go?</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
