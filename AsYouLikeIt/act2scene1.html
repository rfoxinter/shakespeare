<p><center><i>[Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, and two or three Lords, like</p>

<p>foresters.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span></p>

<p>Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,</p>

<p>Hath not old custom made this life more sweet</p>

<p>Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods</p>

<p>More free from peril than the envious court?</p>

<p>Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,</p>

<p>The seasons’ difference, as the icy fang</p>

<p>And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind,</p>

<p>Which when it bites and blows upon my body</p>

<p>Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say</p>

<p>“This is no flattery. These are counselors</p>

<p>That feelingly persuade me what I am.”</p>

<p>Sweet are the uses of adversity,</p>

<p>Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</p>

<p>Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.</p>

<p>And this our life, exempt from public haunt,</p>

<p>Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</p>

<p>Sermons in stones, and good in everything.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Amiens</span></p>

<p>I would not change it. Happy is your Grace,</p>

<p>That can translate the stubbornness of fortune</p>

<p>Into so quiet and so sweet a style.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span></p>

<p>Come, shall we go and kill us venison?</p>

<p>And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,</p>

<p>Being native burghers of this desert city,</p>

<p>Should in their own confines with forked heads</p>

<p>Have their round haunches gored.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  Indeed, my lord,</p>

<p>The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,</p>

<p>And in that kind swears you do more usurp</p>

<p>Than doth your brother that hath banished you.</p>

<p>Today my Lord of Amiens and myself</p>

<p>Did steal behind him as he lay along</p>

<p>Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out</p>

<p>Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;</p>

<p>To the which place a poor sequestered stag</p>

<p>That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt</p>

<p>Did come to languish. And indeed, my lord,</p>

<p>The wretched animal heaved forth such groans</p>

<p>That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat</p>

<p>Almost to bursting, and the big round tears</p>

<p>Coursed one another down his innocent nose</p>

<p>In piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool,</p>

<p>Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,</p>

<p>Stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook,</p>

<p>Augmenting it with tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span>  But what said Jaques?</p>

<p>Did he not moralize this spectacle?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>O yes, into a thousand similes.</p>

<p>First, for his weeping into the needless stream:</p>

<p>“Poor deer,” quoth he, “thou mak’st a testament</p>

<p>As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more</p>

<p>To that which had too much.” Then, being there</p>

<p>alone,</p>

<p>Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:</p>

<p>“’Tis right,” quoth he. “Thus misery doth part</p>

<p>The flux of company.” Anon a careless herd,</p>

<p>Full of the pasture, jumps along by him</p>

<p>And never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth Jaques,</p>

<p>“Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens.</p>

<p>’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look</p>

<p>Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?”</p>

<p>Thus most invectively he pierceth through</p>

<p>The body of country, city, court,</p>

<p>Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we</p>

<p>Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,</p>

<p>To fright the animals and to kill them up</p>

<p>In their assigned and native dwelling place.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span></p>

<p>And did you leave him in this contemplation?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>We did, my lord, weeping and commenting</p>

<p>Upon the sobbing deer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Senior</span>  Show me the place.</p>

<p>I love to cope him in these sullen fits,</p>

<p>For then he’s full of matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  I’ll bring you to him straight.</p>
