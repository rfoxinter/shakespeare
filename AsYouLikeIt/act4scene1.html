<p><center><i>[Enter Rosalind as Ganymede, and Celia as Aliena,</p>

<p>and Jaques.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better</p>

<p>acquainted with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  They say you are a melancholy</p>

<p>fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  I am so. I do love it better than laughing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Those that are in extremity</p>

<p>of either are abominable fellows and betray</p>

<p>themselves to every modern censure worse than</p>

<p>drunkards.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Why then, ’tis good to be a</p>

<p>post.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which</p>

<p>is emulation; nor the musician’s, which is fantastical;</p>

<p>nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the</p>

<p>soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s,</p>

<p>which is politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor</p>

<p>the lover’s, which is all these; but it is a melancholy</p>

<p>of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted</p>

<p>from many objects, and indeed the sundry</p>

<p>contemplation of my travels, in which my often</p>

<p>rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  A traveller. By my faith, you</p>

<p>have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold</p>

<p>your own lands to see other men’s. Then to have</p>

<p>seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes</p>

<p>and poor hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  Yes, I have gained my experience.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  And your experience makes</p>

<p>you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry</p>

<p>than experience to make me sad–and to travel for</p>

<p>it too.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Orlando.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span></p>

<p>Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jaques</span>  Nay then, God be wi’ you, an you talk in blank</p>

<p>verse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Farewell, Monsieur Traveller.</p>

<p>Look you lisp and wear strange suits, disable all</p>

<p>the benefits of your own country, be out of love with</p>

<p>your nativity, and almost chide God for making you</p>

<p>that countenance you are, or I will scarce think you</p>

<p>have swam in a gondola.</p>

<p><center><i>[Jaques exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all</p>

<p>this while? You a lover? An you serve me such</p>

<p>another trick, never come in my sight more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of</p>

<p>my promise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Break an hour’s promise in</p>

<p>love? He that will divide a minute into a thousand</p>

<p>parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a</p>

<p>minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him</p>

<p>that Cupid hath clapped him o’ th’ shoulder, but I’ll</p>

<p>warrant him heart-whole.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Nay, an you be so tardy,</p>

<p>come no more in my sight. I had as lief be wooed of</p>

<p>a snail.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Of a snail?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Ay, of a snail, for though he</p>

<p>comes slowly, he carries his house on his head–a</p>

<p>better jointure, I think, than you make a woman.</p>

<p>Besides, he brings his destiny with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  What’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Why, horns, which such as</p>

<p>you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But</p>

<p>he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the</p>

<p>slander of his wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Virtue is no hornmaker, and my Rosalind is</p>

<p>virtuous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  And I am your Rosalind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i>  It pleases him to call you so, but he</p>

<p>hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede, to Orlando]</i>  Come, woo me,</p>

<p>woo me, for now I am in a holiday humor, and like</p>

<p>enough to consent. What would you say to me now</p>

<p>an I were your very, very Rosalind?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I would kiss before I spoke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Nay, you were better speak</p>

<p>first, and when you were gravelled for lack of</p>

<p>matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good</p>

<p>orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for</p>

<p>lovers lacking–God warn us–matter, the cleanliest</p>

<p>shift is to kiss.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  How if the kiss be denied?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Then she puts you to entreaty,</p>

<p>and there begins new matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Who could be out, being before his beloved</p>

<p>mistress?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Marry, that should you if I</p>

<p>were your mistress, or I should think my honesty</p>

<p>ranker than my wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  What, of my suit?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Not out of your apparel, and</p>

<p>yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I take some joy to say you are because I</p>

<p>would be talking of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Well, in her person I say I</p>

<p>will not have you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Then, in mine own person I die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  No, faith, die by attorney.</p>

<p>The poor world is almost six thousand years old,</p>

<p>and in all this time there was not any man died in</p>

<p>his own person, videlicet, in a love cause. Troilus</p>

<p>had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club, yet</p>

<p>he did what he could to die before, and he is one of</p>

<p>the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived</p>

<p>many a fair year though Hero had turned nun, if it</p>

<p>had not been for a hot midsummer night, for, good</p>

<p>youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont</p>

<p>and, being taken with the cramp, was</p>

<p>drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age</p>

<p>found it was Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies.</p>

<p>Men have died from time to time and worms have</p>

<p>eaten them, but not for love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I would not have my right Rosalind of this</p>

<p>mind, for I protest her frown might kill me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  By this hand, it will not kill a</p>

<p>fly. But come; now I will be your Rosalind in a more</p>

<p>coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I</p>

<p>will grant it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Then love me, Rosalind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and</p>

<p>Saturdays and all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  And wilt thou have me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Ay, and twenty such.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  What sayest thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Are you not good?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I hope so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Why then, can one desire</p>

<p>too much of a good thing?–Come, sister, you shall</p>

<p>be the priest and marry us.–Give me your hand,</p>

<p>Orlando.–What do you say, sister?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span> <i>[to Celia]</i>  Pray thee marry us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i>  I cannot say the words.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  You must begin “Will you,</p>

<p>Orlando–”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span> <i>[as Aliena]</i>  Go to.–Will you, Orlando, have to</p>

<p>wife this Rosalind?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Ay, but when?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Why now, as fast as she can marry us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Then you must say “I take</p>

<p>thee, Rosalind, for wife.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  I might ask you for your</p>

<p>commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my</p>

<p>husband. There’s a girl goes before the priest, and</p>

<p>certainly a woman’s thought runs before her</p>

<p>actions.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  So do all thoughts. They are winged.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Now tell me how long you</p>

<p>would have her after you have possessed her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Forever and a day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Say “a day” without the</p>

<p>“ever.” No, no, Orlando, men are April when they</p>

<p>woo, December when they wed. Maids are May</p>

<p>when they are maids, but the sky changes when</p>

<p>they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a</p>

<p>Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous</p>

<p>than a parrot against rain, more newfangled than</p>

<p>an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I</p>

<p>will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain,</p>

<p>and I will do that when you are disposed to be</p>

<p>merry. I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou</p>

<p>art inclined to sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  But will my Rosalind do so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  By my life, she will do as I</p>

<p>do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  O, but she is wise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Or else she could not have</p>

<p>the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make</p>

<p>the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the</p>

<p>casement. Shut that, and ’twill out at the keyhole.</p>

<p>Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the</p>

<p>chimney.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  A man that had a wife with such a wit, he</p>

<p>might say “Wit, whither wilt?”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Nay, you might keep that</p>

<p>check for it till you met your wife’s wit going to</p>

<p>your neighbor’s bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  And what wit could wit have to excuse that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Marry, to say she came to</p>

<p>seek you there. You shall never take her without her</p>

<p>answer unless you take her without her tongue. O,</p>

<p>that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s</p>

<p>occasion, let her never nurse her child</p>

<p>herself, for she will breed it like a fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Alas, dear love, I cannot lack</p>

<p>thee two hours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  I must attend the Duke at dinner. By two</p>

<p>o’clock I will be with thee again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Ay, go your ways, go your</p>

<p>ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends told</p>

<p>me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering</p>

<p>tongue of yours won me. ’Tis but one cast away, and</p>

<p>so, come, death. Two o’clock is your hour?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  Ay, sweet Rosalind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  By my troth, and in good</p>

<p>earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty</p>

<p>oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of</p>

<p>your promise or come one minute behind your</p>

<p>hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise,</p>

<p>and the most hollow lover, and the most</p>

<p>unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be</p>

<p>chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful.</p>

<p>Therefore beware my censure, and keep your</p>

<p>promise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Orlando</span>  With no less religion than if thou wert indeed</p>

<p>my Rosalind. So, adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i>  Well, time is the old justice</p>

<p>that examines all such offenders, and let time try.</p>

<p>Adieu.</p>

<p><center><i>[Orlando exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate.</p>

<p>We must have your doublet and hose plucked</p>

<p>over your head and show the world what the bird</p>

<p>hath done to her own nest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou</p>

<p>didst know how many fathom deep I am in love. But</p>

<p>it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an</p>

<p>unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Or rather bottomless, that as fast as you pour</p>

<p>affection in, it runs out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  No, that same wicked bastard of Venus, that</p>

<p>was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born</p>

<p>of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses</p>

<p>everyone’s eyes because his own are out, let him be</p>

<p>judge how deep I am in love. I’ll tell thee, Aliena, I</p>

<p>cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I’ll go find a</p>

<p>shadow and sigh till he come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  And I’ll sleep.</p>
