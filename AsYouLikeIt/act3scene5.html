<p><center><i>[Enter Silvius and Phoebe.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span></p>

<p>Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me. Do not, Phoebe.</p>

<p>Say that you love me not, but say not so</p>

<p>In bitterness. The common executioner,</p>

<p>Whose heart th’ accustomed sight of death makes</p>

<p>hard,</p>

<p>Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck</p>

<p>But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be</p>

<p>Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter, unobserved, Rosalind as Ganymede, Celia as</p>

<p>Aliena, and Corin.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span></p>

<p>I would not be thy executioner.</p>

<p>I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.</p>

<p>Thou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye.</p>

<p>’Tis pretty, sure, and very probable</p>

<p>That eyes, that are the frail’st and softest things,</p>

<p>Who shut their coward gates on atomies,</p>

<p>Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers.</p>

<p>Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,</p>

<p>And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.</p>

<p>Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;</p>

<p>Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,</p>

<p>Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.</p>

<p>Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.</p>

<p>Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains</p>

<p>Some scar of it. Lean upon a rush,</p>

<p>The cicatrice and capable impressure</p>

<p>Thy palm some moment keeps. But now mine eyes,</p>

<p>Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;</p>

<p>Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes</p>

<p>That can do hurt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span>  O dear Phoebe,</p>

<p>If ever–as that ever may be near–</p>

<p>You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,</p>

<p>Then shall you know the wounds invisible</p>

<p>That love’s keen arrows make.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span>  But till that time</p>

<p>Come not thou near me. And when that time</p>

<p>comes,</p>

<p>Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not,</p>

<p>As till that time I shall not pity thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede, coming forward]</i></p>

<p>And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,</p>

<p>That you insult, exult, and all at once,</p>

<p>Over the wretched? What though you have no</p>

<p>beauty–</p>

<p>As, by my faith, I see no more in you</p>

<p>Than without candle may go dark to bed–</p>

<p>Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?</p>

<p>Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?</p>

<p>I see no more in you than in the ordinary</p>

<p>Of nature’s sale-work.–’Od’s my little life,</p>

<p>I think she means to tangle my eyes, too.–</p>

<p>No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it.</p>

<p>’Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,</p>

<p>Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream</p>

<p>That can entame my spirits to your worship.–</p>

<p>You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,</p>

<p>Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?</p>

<p>You are a thousand times a properer man</p>

<p>Than she a woman. ’Tis such fools as you</p>

<p>That makes the world full of ill-favored children.</p>

<p>’Tis not her glass but you that flatters her,</p>

<p>And out of you she sees herself more proper</p>

<p>Than any of her lineaments can show her.–</p>

<p>But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees</p>

<p>And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love,</p>

<p>For I must tell you friendly in your ear,</p>

<p>Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.</p>

<p>Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer.</p>

<p>Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.–</p>

<p>So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span></p>

<p>Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together.</p>

<p>I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span><i>[,as Ganymede]</i>  He’s fall’n in love with your</p>

<p>foulness. <i>[(To Silvius.)]</i> And she’ll fall in love with</p>

<p>my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with</p>

<p>frowning looks, I’ll sauce her with bitter words. <i>[(To</p>

<p>Phoebe.)]</i> Why look you so upon me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span>  For no ill will I bear you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span> <i>[as Ganymede]</i></p>

<p>I pray you, do not fall in love with me,</p>

<p>For I am falser than vows made in wine.</p>

<p>Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,</p>

<p>’Tis at the tuft of olives, here hard by.–</p>

<p>Will you go, sister?–Shepherd, ply her hard.–</p>

<p>Come, sister.–Shepherdess, look on him better,</p>

<p>And be not proud. Though all the world could see,</p>

<p>None could be so abused in sight as he.–</p>

<p>Come, to our flock.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits, with Celia and Corin.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:</p>

<p>“Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span></p>

<p>Sweet Phoebe–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span>  Ha, what sayst thou, Silvius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span>  Sweet Phoebe, pity me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span></p>

<p>Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span></p>

<p>Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.</p>

<p>If you do sorrow at my grief in love,</p>

<p>By giving love your sorrow and my grief</p>

<p>Were both extermined.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span></p>

<p>Thou hast my love. Is not that neighborly?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span></p>

<p>I would have you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span>  Why, that were covetousness.</p>

<p>Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;</p>

<p>And yet it is not that I bear thee love;</p>

<p>But since that thou canst talk of love so well,</p>

<p>Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,</p>

<p>I will endure, and I’ll employ thee too.</p>

<p>But do not look for further recompense</p>

<p>Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span></p>

<p>So holy and so perfect is my love,</p>

<p>And I in such a poverty of grace,</p>

<p>That I shall think it a most plenteous crop</p>

<p>To glean the broken ears after the man</p>

<p>That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then</p>

<p>A scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span></p>

<p>Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span></p>

<p>Not very well, but I have met him oft,</p>

<p>And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds</p>

<p>That the old carlot once was master of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span></p>

<p>Think not I love him, though I ask for him.</p>

<p>’Tis but a peevish boy–yet he talks well–</p>

<p>But what care I for words? Yet words do well</p>

<p>When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.</p>

<p>It is a pretty youth–not very pretty–</p>

<p>But sure he’s proud–and yet his pride becomes</p>

<p>him.</p>

<p>He’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him</p>

<p>Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue</p>

<p>Did make offense, his eye did heal it up.</p>

<p>He is not very tall–yet for his years he’s tall.</p>

<p>His leg is but so-so–and yet ’tis well.</p>

<p>There was a pretty redness in his lip,</p>

<p>A little riper and more lusty red</p>

<p>Than that mixed in his cheek: ’twas just the</p>

<p>difference</p>

<p>Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.</p>

<p>There be some women, Silvius, had they marked</p>

<p>him</p>

<p>In parcels as I did, would have gone near</p>

<p>To fall in love with him; but for my part</p>

<p>I love him not nor hate him not; and yet</p>

<p>I have more cause to hate him than to love him.</p>

<p>For what had he to do to chide at me?</p>

<p>He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,</p>

<p>And now I am remembered, scorned at me.</p>

<p>I marvel why I answered not again.</p>

<p>But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance.</p>

<p>I’ll write to him a very taunting letter,</p>

<p>And thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, Silvius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Silvius</span></p>

<p>Phoebe, with all my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phoebe</span>  I’ll write it straight.</p>

<p>The matter’s in my head and in my heart.</p>

<p>I will be bitter with him and passing short.</p>

<p>Go with me, Silvius.</p>
