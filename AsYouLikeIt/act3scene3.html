<p><center><i>[Enter Touchstone and Audrey, followed by Jaques.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Come apace, good Audrey. I will fetch up</p>

<p>your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? Am I the</p>

<p>man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Audrey</sc>  Your features, Lord warrant us! What</p>

<p>features?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  I am here with thee and thy goats, as the</p>

<p>most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the</p>

<p>Goths.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than</p>

<p>Jove in a thatched house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  When a man’s verses cannot be understood,</p>

<p>nor a man’s good wit seconded with the</p>

<p>forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more</p>

<p>dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I</p>

<p>would the gods had made thee poetical.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Audrey</sc>  I do not know what “poetical” is. Is it honest</p>

<p>in deed and word? Is it a true thing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most</p>

<p>feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what</p>

<p>they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do</p>

<p>feign.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Audrey</sc>  Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me</p>

<p>poetical?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou</p>

<p>art honest. Now if thou wert a poet, I might have</p>

<p>some hope thou didst feign.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Audrey</sc>  Would you not have me honest?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favored;</p>

<p>for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a</p>

<p>sauce to sugar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  A material fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Audrey</sc>  Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the</p>

<p>gods make me honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a</p>

<p>foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean</p>

<p>dish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Audrey</sc>  I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am</p>

<p>foul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;</p>

<p>sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may</p>

<p>be, I will marry thee; and to that end I have been</p>

<p>with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village,</p>

<p>who hath promised to meet me in this place of the</p>

<p>forest and to couple us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  I would fain see this meeting.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Audrey</sc>  Well, the gods give us joy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful</p>

<p>heart, stagger in this attempt, for here we have no</p>

<p>temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts.</p>

<p>But what though? Courage. As horns are odious,</p>

<p>they are necessary. It is said “Many a man knows no</p>

<p>end of his goods.” Right: many a man has good</p>

<p>horns and knows no end of them. Well, that is the</p>

<p>dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting.</p>

<p>Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no. The</p>

<p>noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the</p>

<p>single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town</p>

<p>is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of</p>

<p>a married man more honorable than the bare brow</p>

<p>of a bachelor. And by how much defense is better</p>

<p>than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious</p>

<p>than to want.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Oliver Martext.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes Sir Oliver.–Sir Oliver Martext, you are</p>

<p>well met. Will you dispatch us here under this tree,</p>

<p>or shall we go with you to your chapel?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc> <sc>Martext</sc>  Is there none here to give the</p>

<p>woman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  I will not take her on gift of any man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc> <sc>Martext</sc>  Truly, she must be given, or the</p>

<p>marriage is not lawful.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc> <i>[coming forward]</i>  Proceed, proceed. I’ll give</p>

<p>her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Good even, good Monsieur What-you-call-’t.</p>

<p>How do you, sir? You are very well met. God</p>

<p>’ild you for your last company. I am very glad to see</p>

<p>you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay, pray be</p>

<p>covered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc>  Will you be married, motley?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his</p>

<p>curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his</p>

<p>desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be</p>

<p>nibbling.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc>  And will you, being a man of your breeding, be</p>

<p>married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to</p>

<p>church, and have a good priest that can tell you</p>

<p>what marriage is. This fellow will but join you</p>

<p>together as they join wainscot. Then one of you will</p>

<p>prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp,</p>

<p>warp.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  I am not in the mind but I were better to</p>

<p>be married of him than of another, for he is not like</p>

<p>to marry me well, and not being well married, it</p>

<p>will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my</p>

<p>wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaques</sc>  Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Touchstone</sc>  Come, sweet Audrey. We must be married,</p>

<p>or we must live in bawdry.–Farewell, good</p>

<p>Master Oliver, not</p>

<p>           <i>O sweet Oliver,</i></p>

<p>           <i>O brave Oliver,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Leave me not behind thee,</i></p>

<p>But</p>

<p>           <i>Wind away,</i></p>

<p>           <i>Begone, I say,</i></p>

<p>        <i>I will not to wedding with thee.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[Audrey, Touchstone, and Jaques exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc> <sc>Martext</sc>  ’Tis no matter. Ne’er a fantastical</p>

<p>knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
