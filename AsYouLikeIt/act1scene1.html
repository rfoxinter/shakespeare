<p><center><i>[Enter Orlando and Adam.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  As I remember, Adam, it was upon this</p>

<p>fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand</p>

<p>crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother on</p>

<p>his blessing to breed me well. And there begins my</p>

<p>sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</p>

<p>report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he</p>

<p>keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more</p>

<p>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you</p>

<p>that “keeping,” for a gentleman of my birth, that</p>

<p>differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are</p>

<p>bred better, for, besides that they are fair with their</p>

<p>feeding, they are taught their manage and, to that</p>

<p>end, riders dearly hired. But I, his brother, gain</p>

<p>nothing under him but growth, for the which his</p>

<p>animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him</p>

<p>as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives</p>

<p>me, the something that nature gave me his countenance</p>

<p>seems to take from me. He lets me feed with</p>

<p>his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as</p>

<p>much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my</p>

<p>education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the</p>

<p>spirit of my father, which I think is within me,</p>

<p>begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no</p>

<p>longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy</p>

<p>how to avoid it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Oliver.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adam</sc>  Yonder comes my master, your brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he</p>

<p>will shake me up.     <i><i>[Adam steps aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Now, sir, what make you here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Nothing. I am not taught to make anything.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  What mar you then, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that</p>

<p>which God made, a poor unworthy brother of</p>

<p>yours, with idleness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught</p>

<p>awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with</p>

<p>them? What prodigal portion have I spent that I</p>

<p>should come to such penury?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Know you where you are, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  O, sir, very well: here in your orchard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Know you before whom, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I</p>

<p>know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle</p>

<p>condition of blood you should so know me. The</p>

<p>courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you</p>

<p>are the first-born, but the same tradition takes not</p>

<p>away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt</p>

<p>us. I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I</p>

<p>confess your coming before me is nearer to his</p>

<p>reverence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc> <i>[threatening Orlando]</i>  What, boy!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc> <i>[holding off Oliver by the throat]</i>  Come,</p>

<p>come, elder brother, you are too young in this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  I am no villain. I am the youngest son of Sir</p>

<p>Rowland de Boys. He was my father, and he is</p>

<p>thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains.</p>

<p>Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this</p>

<p>hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out</p>

<p>thy tongue for saying so. Thou hast railed on thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adam</sc> <i>[coming forward]</i>  Sweet masters, be patient. For</p>

<p>your father’s remembrance, be at accord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc> <i>[to Orlando]</i>  Let me go, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My</p>

<p>father charged you in his will to give me good</p>

<p>education. You have trained me like a peasant,</p>

<p>obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike</p>

<p>qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in</p>

<p>me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow</p>

<p>me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or</p>

<p>give me the poor allottery my father left me by</p>

<p>testament. With that I will go buy my fortunes.</p>

<p><center><i>[Orlando releases Oliver.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  And what wilt thou do–beg when that is</p>

<p>spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will not long be</p>

<p>troubled with you. You shall have some part of your</p>

<p>will. I pray you leave me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Orlando</sc>  I will no further offend you than becomes</p>

<p>me for my good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc> <i>[to Adam]</i>  Get you with him, you old dog.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adam</sc>  Is “old dog” my reward? Most true, I have lost</p>

<p>my teeth in your service. God be with my old</p>

<p>master. He would not have spoke such a word.</p>

<p><center><i>[Orlando and Adam exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I</p>

<p>will physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand</p>

<p>crowns neither.–Holla, Dennis!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dennis.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dennis</sc>  Calls your Worship?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Was not Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, here to</p>

<p>speak with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dennis</sc>  So please you, he is here at the door and</p>

<p>importunes access to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Call him in. <i>[Dennis exits.]</i> ’Twill be a good</p>

<p>way, and tomorrow the wrestling is.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Charles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc>  Good morrow to your Worship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Good Monsieur Charles, what’s the new news</p>

<p>at the new court?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc>  There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old</p>

<p>news. That is, the old duke is banished by his</p>

<p>younger brother the new duke, and three or four</p>

<p>loving lords have put themselves into voluntary</p>

<p>exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich</p>

<p>the new duke. Therefore he gives them good leave</p>

<p>to wander.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter,</p>

<p>be banished with her father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc>  O, no, for the Duke’s daughter her cousin so</p>

<p>loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together,</p>

<p>that she would have followed her exile or have</p>

<p>died to stay behind her. She is at the court and no</p>

<p>less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter,</p>

<p>and never two ladies loved as they do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Where will the old duke live?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc>  They say he is already in the Forest of Arden,</p>

<p>and a many merry men with him; and there they</p>

<p>live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say</p>

<p>many young gentlemen flock to him every day and</p>

<p>fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden</p>

<p>world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new</p>

<p>duke?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc>  Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you</p>

<p>with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand</p>

<p>that your younger brother Orlando hath a</p>

<p>disposition to come in disguised against me to try a</p>

<p>fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he</p>

<p>that escapes me without some broken limb shall</p>

<p>acquit him well. Your brother is but young and</p>

<p>tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil</p>

<p>him, as I must for my own honor if he come in.</p>

<p>Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to</p>

<p>acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him</p>

<p>from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well</p>

<p>as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own</p>

<p>search and altogether against my will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which</p>

<p>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had</p>

<p>myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein, and</p>

<p>have by underhand means labored to dissuade him</p>

<p>from it; but he is resolute. I’ll tell thee, Charles, it is</p>

<p>the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of</p>

<p>ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good</p>

<p>parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me</p>

<p>his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I</p>

<p>had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger.</p>

<p>And thou wert best look to ’t, for if thou dost him</p>

<p>any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace</p>

<p>himself on thee, he will practice against thee by</p>

<p>poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device,</p>

<p>and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by</p>

<p>some indirect means or other. For I assure thee–</p>

<p>and almost with tears I speak it–there is not one so</p>

<p>young and so villainous this day living. I speak but</p>

<p>brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to</p>

<p>thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must</p>

<p>look pale and wonder.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc>  I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he</p>

<p>come tomorrow, I’ll give him his payment. If ever</p>

<p>he go alone again, I’ll never wrestle for prize more.</p>

<p>And so God keep your Worship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oliver</sc>  Farewell, good Charles.     <i><i>[Charles exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an</p>

<p>end of him, for my soul–yet I know not why–</p>

<p>hates nothing more than he. Yet he’s gentle, never</p>

<p>schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all</p>

<p>sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in</p>

<p>the heart of the world, and especially of my own</p>

<p>people, who best know him, that I am altogether</p>

<p>misprized. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler</p>

<p>shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the</p>

<p>boy thither, which now I’ll go about.</p>
