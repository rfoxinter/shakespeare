<p><center><i>[Enter Celia and Rosalind.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Why, cousin! Why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy,</p>

<p>not a word?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Not one to throw at a dog.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  No, thy words are too precious to be cast away</p>

<p>upon curs. Throw some of them at me. Come, lame</p>

<p>me with reasons.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Then there were two cousins laid up, when</p>

<p>the one should be lamed with reasons, and the</p>

<p>other mad without any.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  But is all this for your father?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  No, some of it is for my child’s father. O,</p>

<p>how full of briers is this working-day world!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in</p>

<p>holiday foolery. If we walk not in the trodden paths,</p>

<p>our very petticoats will catch them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  I could shake them off my coat. These burs</p>

<p>are in my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Hem them away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  I would try, if I could cry “hem” and have</p>

<p>him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  O, they take the part of a better wrestler</p>

<p>than myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  O, a good wish upon you. You will try in time, in</p>

<p>despite of a fall. But turning these jests out of</p>

<p>service, let us talk in good earnest. Is it possible on</p>

<p>such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking</p>

<p>with old Sir Rowland’s youngest son?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  The Duke my father loved his father dearly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his</p>

<p>son dearly? By this kind of chase I should hate him,</p>

<p>for my father hated his father dearly. Yet I hate not</p>

<p>Orlando.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Let me love him for that, and do you love</p>

<p>him because I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Duke Frederick with Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look, here comes the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  With his eyes full of anger.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Frederick</span> <i>[to Rosalind]</i></p>

<p>Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,</p>

<p>And get you from our court.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Me, uncle?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Frederick</span>  You, cousin.</p>

<p>Within these ten days if that thou beest found</p>

<p>So near our public court as twenty miles,</p>

<p>Thou diest for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  I do beseech your Grace,</p>

<p>Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.</p>

<p>If with myself I hold intelligence</p>

<p>Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,</p>

<p>If that I do not dream or be not frantic–</p>

<p>As I do trust I am not–then, dear uncle,</p>

<p>Never so much as in a thought unborn</p>

<p>Did I offend your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Frederick</span>  Thus do all traitors.</p>

<p>If their purgation did consist in words,</p>

<p>They are as innocent as grace itself.</p>

<p>Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span></p>

<p>Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.</p>

<p>Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Frederick</span></p>

<p>Thou art thy father’s daughter. There’s enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span></p>

<p>So was I when your Highness took his dukedom.</p>

<p>So was I when your Highness banished him.</p>

<p>Treason is not inherited, my lord,</p>

<p>Or if we did derive it from our friends,</p>

<p>What’s that to me? My father was no traitor.</p>

<p>Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much</p>

<p>To think my poverty is treacherous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Dear sovereign, hear me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Frederick</span></p>

<p>Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake;</p>

<p>Else had she with her father ranged along.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span></p>

<p>I did not then entreat to have her stay.</p>

<p>It was your pleasure and your own remorse.</p>

<p>I was too young that time to value her,</p>

<p>But now I know her. If she be a traitor,</p>

<p>Why, so am I. We still have slept together,</p>

<p>Rose at an instant, learned, played, eat together,</p>

<p>And, wheresoe’er we went, like Juno’s swans</p>

<p>Still we went coupled and inseparable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Frederick</span></p>

<p>She is too subtle for thee, and her smoothness,</p>

<p>Her very silence, and her patience</p>

<p>Speak to the people, and they pity her.</p>

<p>Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name,</p>

<p>And thou wilt show more bright and seem more</p>

<p>virtuous</p>

<p>When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.</p>

<p>Firm and irrevocable is my doom</p>

<p>Which I have passed upon her. She is banished.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span></p>

<p>Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.</p>

<p>I cannot live out of her company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <span class='sc'>Frederick</span></p>

<p>You are a fool.–You, niece, provide yourself.</p>

<p>If you outstay the time, upon mine honor</p>

<p>And in the greatness of my word, you die.</p>

<p><center><i>[Duke and Lords exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span></p>

<p>O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?</p>

<p>Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.</p>

<p>I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  I have more cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span>  Thou hast not, cousin.</p>

<p>Prithee, be cheerful. Know’st thou not the Duke</p>

<p>Hath banished me, his daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  That he hath not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span></p>

<p>No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love</p>

<p>Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.</p>

<p>Shall we be sundered? Shall we part, sweet girl?</p>

<p>No, let my father seek another heir.</p>

<p>Therefore devise with me how we may fly,</p>

<p>Whither to go, and what to bear with us,</p>

<p>And do not seek to take your change upon you,</p>

<p>To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out.</p>

<p>For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,</p>

<p>Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Why, whither shall we go?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span></p>

<p>To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span></p>

<p>Alas, what danger will it be to us,</p>

<p>Maids as we are, to travel forth so far?</p>

<p>Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span></p>

<p>I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire,</p>

<p>And with a kind of umber smirch my face.</p>

<p>The like do you. So shall we pass along</p>

<p>And never stir assailants.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span>  Were it not better,</p>

<p>Because that I am more than common tall,</p>

<p>That I did suit me all points like a man?</p>

<p>A gallant curtal-ax upon my thigh,</p>

<p>A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart</p>

<p>Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will,</p>

<p>We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside–</p>

<p>As many other mannish cowards have</p>

<p>That do outface it with their semblances.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span></p>

<p>What shall I call thee when thou art a man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span></p>

<p>I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page,</p>

<p>And therefore look you call me Ganymede.</p>

<p>But what will you be called?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span></p>

<p>Something that hath a reference to my state:</p>

<p>No longer Celia, but Aliena.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosalind</span></p>

<p>But, cousin, what if we assayed to steal</p>

<p>The clownish fool out of your father’s court?</p>

<p>Would he not be a comfort to our travel?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Celia</span></p>

<p>He’ll go along o’er the wide world with me.</p>

<p>Leave me alone to woo him. Let’s away</p>

<p>And get our jewels and our wealth together,</p>

<p>Devise the fittest time and safest way</p>

<p>To hide us from pursuit that will be made</p>

<p>After my flight. Now go we in content</p>

<p>To liberty, and not to banishment.</p>
