<p><center><i>[Enter the King with Green and Bagot, at one door,</p>

<p>and the Lord Aumerle at another.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc>  We did observe.–Cousin Aumerle,</p>

<p>How far brought you high Hereford on his way?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc></p>

<p>I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,</p>

<p>But to the next highway, and there I left him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>And say, what store of parting tears were shed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc></p>

<p>Faith, none for me, except the northeast wind,</p>

<p>Which then blew bitterly against our faces,</p>

<p>Awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance</p>

<p>Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>What said our cousin when you parted with him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc>  “Farewell.”</p>

<p>And, for my heart disdained that my tongue</p>

<p>Should so profane the word, that taught me craft</p>

<p>To counterfeit oppression of such grief</p>

<p>That words seemed buried in my sorrow’s grave.</p>

<p>Marry, would the word “farewell” have lengthened</p>

<p>hours</p>

<p>And added years to his short banishment,</p>

<p>He should have had a volume of farewells.</p>

<p>But since it would not, he had none of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>He is our cousin, cousin, but ’tis doubt,</p>

<p>When time shall call him home from banishment,</p>

<p>Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.</p>

<p>Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green,</p>

<p>Observed his courtship to the common people,</p>

<p>How he did seem to dive into their hearts</p>

<p>With humble and familiar courtesy,</p>

<p>What reverence he did throw away on slaves,</p>

<p>Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles</p>

<p>And patient underbearing of his fortune,</p>

<p>As ’twere to banish their affects with him.</p>

<p>Off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench;</p>

<p>A brace of draymen bid God speed him well</p>

<p>And had the tribute of his supple knee,</p>

<p>With “Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends,”</p>

<p>As were our England in reversion his</p>

<p>And he our subjects’ next degree in hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Green</sc></p>

<p>Well, he is gone, and with him go these thoughts.</p>

<p>Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,</p>

<p>Expedient manage must be made, my liege,</p>

<p>Ere further leisure yield them further means</p>

<p>For their advantage and your Highness’ loss.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>We will ourself in person to this war.</p>

<p>And, for our coffers, with too great a court</p>

<p>And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,</p>

<p>We are enforced to farm our royal realm,</p>

<p>The revenue whereof shall furnish us</p>

<p>For our affairs in hand. If that come short,</p>

<p>Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters,</p>

<p>Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,</p>

<p>They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold</p>

<p>And send them after to supply our wants,</p>

<p>For we will make for Ireland presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bushy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Bushy, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bushy</sc></p>

<p>Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,</p>

<p>Suddenly taken, and hath sent posthaste</p>

<p>To entreat your Majesty to visit him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc>  Where lies he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bushy</sc>  At Ely House.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Now put it, God, in the physician’s mind</p>

<p>To help him to his grave immediately!</p>

<p>The lining of his coffers shall make coats</p>

<p>To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.</p>

<p>Come, gentlemen, let’s all go visit him.</p>

<p>Pray God we may make haste and come too late.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Amen!</p>
