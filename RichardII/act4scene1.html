<p><center><i>[Enter Bolingbroke with the Lords Aumerle,</p>

<p>Northumberland, Harry Percy, Fitzwater, Surrey, the</p>

<p>Bishop of Carlisle, the Abbot of Westminster, and</p>

<p>another Lord, Herald, Officers to parliament.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc>  Call forth Bagot.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Officers with Bagot.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind</p>

<p>What thou dost know of noble Gloucester’s death,</p>

<p>Who wrought it with the King, and who performed</p>

<p>The bloody office of his timeless end.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bagot</sc></p>

<p>Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.</p>

<p><center><i>[Aumerle steps forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bagot</sc></p>

<p>My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue</p>

<p>Scorns to unsay what once it hath delivered.</p>

<p>In that dead time when Gloucester’s death was</p>

<p>plotted,</p>

<p>I heard you say “Is not my arm of length,</p>

<p>That reacheth from the restful English court</p>

<p>As far as Calais, to mine uncle’s head?”</p>

<p>Amongst much other talk that very time</p>

<p>I heard you say that you had rather refuse</p>

<p>The offer of an hundred thousand crowns</p>

<p>Than Bolingbroke’s return to England,</p>

<p>Adding withal how blest this land would be</p>

<p>In this your cousin’s death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc>  Princes and noble lords,</p>

<p>What answer shall I make to this base man?</p>

<p>Shall I so much dishonor my fair stars</p>

<p>On equal terms to give him chastisement?</p>

<p>Either I must or have mine honor soiled</p>

<p>With the attainder of his slanderous lips.</p>

<p><center><i>[He throws down a gage.]</i></center></p>

<p>There is my gage, the manual seal of death</p>

<p>That marks thee out for hell. I say thou liest,</p>

<p>And will maintain what thou hast said is false</p>

<p>In thy heart-blood, though being all too base</p>

<p>To stain the temper of my knightly sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Bagot, forbear. Thou shalt not take it up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc></p>

<p>Excepting one, I would he were the best</p>

<p>In all this presence that hath moved me so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fitzwater</sc> <i>[throwing down a gage]</i></p>

<p>If that thy valor stand on sympathy,</p>

<p>There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine.</p>

<p>By that fair sun which shows me where thou</p>

<p>stand’st,</p>

<p>I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spak’st it,</p>

<p>That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester’s death.</p>

<p>If thou deniest it twenty times, thou liest,</p>

<p>And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,</p>

<p>Where it was forged, with my rapier’s point.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc> <i>[taking up the gage]</i></p>

<p>Thou dar’st not, coward, live to see that day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fitzwater</sc></p>

<p>Now, by my soul, I would it were this hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc></p>

<p>Fitzwater, thou art damned to hell for this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Percy</sc></p>

<p>Aumerle, thou liest! His honor is as true</p>

<p>In this appeal as thou art all unjust;</p>

<p>And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,</p>

<p><center><i>[He throws down a gage.]</i></center></p>

<p>To prove it on thee to the extremest point</p>

<p>Of mortal breathing. Seize it if thou dar’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc> <i>[taking up the gage]</i></p>

<p>An if I do not, may my hands rot off</p>

<p>And never brandish more revengeful steel</p>

<p>Over the glittering helmet of my foe!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Another</sc> <sc>Lord</sc> <i>[throwing down a gage]</i></p>

<p>I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle,</p>

<p>And spur thee on with full as many lies</p>

<p>As may be holloed in thy treacherous ear</p>

<p>From sun to sun. There is my honor’s pawn.</p>

<p>Engage it to the trial if thou darest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc> <i>[taking up the gage]</i></p>

<p>Who sets me else? By heaven, I’ll throw at all!</p>

<p>I have a thousand spirits in one breast</p>

<p>To answer twenty thousand such as you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc></p>

<p>My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well</p>

<p>The very time Aumerle and you did talk.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fitzwater</sc></p>

<p>’Tis very true. You were in presence then,</p>

<p>And you can witness with me this is true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc></p>

<p>As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fitzwater</sc></p>

<p>Surrey, thou liest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Surrey</sc>  Dishonorable boy,</p>

<p>That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword</p>

<p>That it shall render vengeance and revenge</p>

<p>Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie</p>

<p>In earth as quiet as thy father’s skull.</p>

<p><center><i>[He throws down a gage.]</i></center></p>

<p>In proof whereof, there is my honor’s pawn.</p>

<p>Engage it to the trial if thou dar’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fitzwater</sc> <i>[taking up the gage]</i></p>

<p>How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!</p>

<p>If I dare eat or drink or breathe or live,</p>

<p>I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness</p>

<p>And spit upon him whilst I say he lies,</p>

<p>And lies, and lies. There is my bond of faith</p>

<p>To tie thee to my strong correction.     <i><i>[He throws down a gage.]</i></i></p>

<p>As I intend to thrive in this new world,</p>

<p>Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal.–</p>

<p>Besides, I heard the banished Norfolk say</p>

<p>That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men</p>

<p>To execute the noble duke at Calais.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc></p>

<p>Some honest Christian trust me with a gage.</p>

<p><center><i>[A Lord hands him a gage.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Aumerle throws it down.]</i></center></p>

<p>That Norfolk lies, here do I throw down this,</p>

<p>If he may be repealed to try his honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>These differences shall all rest under gage</p>

<p>Till Norfolk be repealed. Repealed he shall be,</p>

<p>And though mine enemy, restored again</p>

<p>To all his lands and seigniories. When he is</p>

<p>returned,</p>

<p>Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Carlisle</sc></p>

<p>That honorable day shall never be seen.</p>

<p>Many a time hath banished Norfolk fought</p>

<p>For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,</p>

<p>Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross</p>

<p>Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens;</p>

<p>And, toiled with works of war, retired himself</p>

<p>To Italy, and there at Venice gave</p>

<p>His body to that pleasant country’s earth</p>

<p>And his pure soul unto his captain, Christ,</p>

<p>Under whose colors he had fought so long.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc>  Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Carlisle</sc>  As surely as I live, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom</p>

<p>Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,</p>

<p>Your differences shall all rest under gage</p>

<p>Till we assign you to your days of trial.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter York.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee</p>

<p>From plume-plucked Richard, who with willing</p>

<p>soul</p>

<p>Adopts thee heir, and his high scepter yields</p>

<p>To the possession of thy royal hand.</p>

<p>Ascend his throne, descending now from him,</p>

<p>And long live Henry, fourth of that name!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>In God’s name, I’ll ascend the regal throne.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Carlisle</sc>  Marry, God forbid!</p>

<p>Worst in this royal presence may I speak,</p>

<p>Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.</p>

<p>Would God that any in this noble presence</p>

<p>Were enough noble to be upright judge</p>

<p>Of noble Richard! Then true noblesse would</p>

<p>Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.</p>

<p>What subject can give sentence on his king?</p>

<p>And who sits here that is not Richard’s subject?</p>

<p>Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,</p>

<p>Although apparent guilt be seen in them;</p>

<p>And shall the figure of God’s majesty,</p>

<p>His captain, steward, deputy elect,</p>

<p>Anointed, crowned, planted many years,</p>

<p>Be judged by subject and inferior breath,</p>

<p>And he himself not present? O, forfend it God</p>

<p>That in a Christian climate souls refined</p>

<p>Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!</p>

<p>I speak to subjects and a subject speaks,</p>

<p>Stirred up by God thus boldly for his king.</p>

<p>My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,</p>

<p>Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford’s king,</p>

<p>And if you crown him, let me prophesy</p>

<p>The blood of English shall manure the ground</p>

<p>And future ages groan for this foul act,</p>

<p>Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,</p>

<p>And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars</p>

<p>Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound.</p>

<p>Disorder, horror, fear, and mutiny</p>

<p>Shall here inhabit, and this land be called</p>

<p>The field of Golgotha and dead men’s skulls.</p>

<p>O, if you raise this house against this house,</p>

<p>It will the woefullest division prove</p>

<p>That ever fell upon this cursed earth!</p>

<p>Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,</p>

<p>Lest child, child’s children, cry against you woe!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Well have you argued, sir, and, for your pains,</p>

<p>Of capital treason we arrest you here.–</p>

<p>My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge</p>

<p>To keep him safely till his day of trial.</p>

<p>May it please you, lords, to grant the commons’</p>

<p>suit?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Fetch hither Richard, that in common view</p>

<p>He may surrender. So we shall proceed</p>

<p>Without suspicion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc>  I will be his conduct.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Lords, you that here are under our arrest,</p>

<p>Procure your sureties for your days of answer.</p>

<p>Little are we beholding to your love</p>

<p>And little looked for at your helping hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Richard and York.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Alack, why am I sent for to a king</p>

<p>Before I have shook off the regal thoughts</p>

<p>Wherewith I reigned? I hardly yet have learned</p>

<p>To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my knee.</p>

<p>Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me</p>

<p>To this submission. Yet I well remember</p>

<p>The favors of these men. Were they not mine?</p>

<p>Did they not sometime cry “All hail” to me?</p>

<p>So Judas did to Christ, but He in twelve</p>

<p>Found truth in all but one; I, in twelve thousand,</p>

<p>none.</p>

<p>God save the King! Will no man say “amen”?</p>

<p>Am I both priest and clerk? Well, then, amen.</p>

<p>God save the King, although I be not he,</p>

<p>And yet amen, if heaven do think him me.</p>

<p>To do what service am I sent for hither?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>To do that office of thine own goodwill</p>

<p>Which tired majesty did make thee offer:</p>

<p>The resignation of thy state and crown</p>

<p>To Henry Bolingbroke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Give me the crown.–Here, cousin, seize the crown.</p>

<p>Here, cousin.</p>

<p>On this side my hand, on that side thine.</p>

<p>Now is this golden crown like a deep well</p>

<p>That owes two buckets, filling one another,</p>

<p>The emptier ever dancing in the air,</p>

<p>The other down, unseen, and full of water.</p>

<p>That bucket down and full of tears am I,</p>

<p>Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>I thought you had been willing to resign.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>My crown I am, but still my griefs are mine.</p>

<p>You may my glories and my state depose</p>

<p>But not my griefs; still am I king of those.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Part of your cares you give me with your crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.</p>

<p>My care is loss of care, by old care done;</p>

<p>Your care is gain of care, by new care won.</p>

<p>The cares I give I have, though given away.</p>

<p>They ’tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Are you contented to resign the crown?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be.</p>

<p>Therefore no “no,” for I resign to thee.</p>

<p>Now, mark me how I will undo myself.</p>

<p>I give this heavy weight from off my head</p>

<p>And this unwieldy scepter from my hand,</p>

<p>The pride of kingly sway from out my heart.</p>

<p>With mine own tears I wash away my balm,</p>

<p>With mine own hands I give away my crown,</p>

<p>With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,</p>

<p>With mine own breath release all duteous oaths.</p>

<p>All pomp and majesty I do forswear.</p>

<p>My manors, rents, revenues I forgo;</p>

<p>My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny.</p>

<p>God pardon all oaths that are broke to me.</p>

<p>God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee.</p>

<p>Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,</p>

<p>And thou with all pleased that hast all achieved.</p>

<p>Long mayst thou live in Richard’s seat to sit,</p>

<p>And soon lie Richard in an earthy pit.</p>

<p>God save King Henry, unkinged Richard says,</p>

<p>And send him many years of sunshine days.</p>

<p>What more remains?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc> <i>[offering Richard a paper]</i></p>

<p>No more, but that you read</p>

<p>These accusations and these grievous crimes</p>

<p>Committed by your person and your followers</p>

<p>Against the state and profit of this land;</p>

<p>That, by confessing them, the souls of men</p>

<p>May deem that you are worthily deposed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Must I do so? And must I ravel out</p>

<p>My weaved-up follies? Gentle Northumberland,</p>

<p>If thy offenses were upon record,</p>

<p>Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop</p>

<p>To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,</p>

<p>There shouldst thou find one heinous article</p>

<p>Containing the deposing of a king</p>

<p>And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,</p>

<p>Marked with a blot, damned in the book of</p>

<p>heaven.–</p>

<p>Nay, all of you that stand and look upon me</p>

<p>Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,</p>

<p>Though some of you, with Pilate, wash your hands,</p>

<p>Showing an outward pity, yet you Pilates</p>

<p>Have here delivered me to my sour cross,</p>

<p>And water cannot wash away your sin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>My lord, dispatch. Read o’er these articles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Mine eyes are full of tears; I cannot see.</p>

<p>And yet salt water blinds them not so much</p>

<p>But they can see a sort of traitors here.</p>

<p>Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,</p>

<p>I find myself a traitor with the rest,</p>

<p>For I have given here my soul’s consent</p>

<p>T’ undeck the pompous body of a king,</p>

<p>Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,</p>

<p>Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc>  My lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,</p>

<p>Nor no man’s lord. I have no name, no title,</p>

<p>No, not that name was given me at the font,</p>

<p>But ’tis usurped. Alack the heavy day,</p>

<p>That I have worn so many winters out</p>

<p>And know not now what name to call myself.</p>

<p>O, that I were a mockery king of snow</p>

<p>Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,</p>

<p>To melt myself away in water drops.–</p>

<p>Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,</p>

<p>An if my word be sterling yet in England,</p>

<p>Let it command a mirror hither straight,</p>

<p>That it may show me what a face I have</p>

<p>Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Go, some of you, and fetch a looking-glass.</p>

<p><center><i>[An Attendant exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Read o’er this paper while the glass doth come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>The commons will not then be satisfied.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>They shall be satisfied. I’ll read enough</p>

<p>When I do see the very book indeed</p>

<p>Where all my sins are writ, and that’s myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter one with a glass.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Give me that glass, and therein will I read.</p>

<p><center><i>[He takes the mirror.]</i></center></p>

<p>No deeper wrinkles yet? Hath sorrow struck</p>

<p>So many blows upon this face of mine</p>

<p>And made no deeper wounds? O flatt’ring glass,</p>

<p>Like to my followers in prosperity,</p>

<p>Thou dost beguile me. Was this face the face</p>

<p>That every day under his household roof</p>

<p>Did keep ten thousand men? Was this the face</p>

<p>That like the sun did make beholders wink?</p>

<p>Is this the face which faced so many follies,</p>

<p>That was at last outfaced by Bolingbroke?</p>

<p>A brittle glory shineth in this face.</p>

<p>As brittle as the glory is the face,</p>

<p><center><i>[He breaks the mirror.]</i></center></p>

<p>For there it is, cracked in an hundred shivers.–</p>

<p>Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport:</p>

<p>How soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>The shadow of your sorrow hath destroyed</p>

<p>The shadow of your face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc>  Say that again.</p>

<p>The shadow of my sorrow? Ha, let’s see.</p>

<p>’Tis very true. My grief lies all within;</p>

<p>And these external manners of laments</p>

<p>Are merely shadows to the unseen grief</p>

<p>That swells with silence in the tortured soul.</p>

<p>There lies the substance. And I thank thee, king,</p>

<p>For thy great bounty, that not only giv’st</p>

<p>Me cause to wail but teachest me the way</p>

<p>How to lament the cause. I’ll beg one boon</p>

<p>And then be gone and trouble you no more.</p>

<p>Shall I obtain it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc>  Name it, fair cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>“Fair cousin”? I am greater than a king,</p>

<p>For when I was a king, my flatterers</p>

<p>Were then but subjects. Being now a subject,</p>

<p>I have a king here to my flatterer.</p>

<p>Being so great, I have no need to beg.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc>  Yet ask.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc>  And shall I have?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc>  You shall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc>  Then give me leave to go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc>  Whither?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Whither you will, so I were from your sights.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Go, some of you, convey him to the Tower.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>O, good! “Convey”? Conveyers are you all,</p>

<p>That rise thus nimbly by a true king’s fall.</p>
