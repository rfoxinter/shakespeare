<p><center><i>[Drums. Flourish and colors. Enter the King, Aumerle,</p>

<p>Carlisle, and Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Barkloughly Castle call they this at hand?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air</p>

<p>After your late tossing on the breaking seas?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Needs must I like it well. I weep for joy</p>

<p>To stand upon my kingdom once again.     <i><i>[He kneels.]</i></i></p>

<p>Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,</p>

<p>Though rebels wound thee with their horses’ hoofs.</p>

<p>As a long-parted mother with her child</p>

<p>Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,</p>

<p>So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,</p>

<p>And do thee favors with my royal hands.</p>

<p>Feed not thy sovereign’s foe, my gentle earth,</p>

<p>Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense,</p>

<p>But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,</p>

<p>And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,</p>

<p>Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet</p>

<p>Which with usurping steps do trample thee.</p>

<p>Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies,</p>

<p>And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,</p>

<p>Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder,</p>

<p>Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch</p>

<p>Throw death upon thy sovereign’s enemies.</p>

<p>Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords.</p>

<p>This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones</p>

<p>Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king</p>

<p>Shall falter under foul rebellion’s arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Carlisle</span></p>

<p>Fear not, my lord. That power that made you king</p>

<p>Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.</p>

<p>The means that heavens yield must be embraced</p>

<p>And not neglected. Else heaven would,</p>

<p>And we will not–heaven’s offer we refuse,</p>

<p>The proffered means of succor and redress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>He means, my lord, that we are too remiss,</p>

<p>Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,</p>

<p>Grows strong and great in substance and in power.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Discomfortable cousin, know’st thou not</p>

<p>That when the searching eye of heaven is hid</p>

<p>Behind the globe that lights the lower world,</p>

<p>Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen</p>

<p>In murders and in outrage boldly here?</p>

<p>But when from under this terrestrial ball</p>

<p>He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines</p>

<p>And darts his light through every guilty hole,</p>

<p>Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,</p>

<p>The cloak of night being plucked from off their</p>

<p>backs,</p>

<p>Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves.</p>

<p>So when this thief, this traitor Bolingbroke,</p>

<p>Who all this while hath reveled in the night</p>

<p>Whilst we were wand’ring with the Antipodes,</p>

<p>Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,</p>

<p>His treasons will sit blushing in his face,</p>

<p>Not able to endure the sight of day,</p>

<p>But self-affrighted, tremble at his sin.</p>

<p>Not all the water in the rough rude sea</p>

<p>Can wash the balm off from an anointed king.</p>

<p>The breath of worldly men cannot depose</p>

<p>The deputy elected by the Lord.</p>

<p>For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed</p>

<p>To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,</p>

<p>God for His Richard hath in heavenly pay</p>

<p>A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,</p>

<p>Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Salisbury.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Welcome, my lord. How far off lies your power?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,</p>

<p>Than this weak arm. Discomfort guides my tongue</p>

<p>And bids me speak of nothing but despair.</p>

<p>One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,</p>

<p>Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth.</p>

<p>O, call back yesterday, bid time return,</p>

<p>And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men.</p>

<p>Today, today, unhappy day too late,</p>

<p>Overthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state;</p>

<p>For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,</p>

<p>Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed, and fled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>Comfort, my liege. Why looks your Grace so pale?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>But now the blood of twenty thousand men</p>

<p>   <i>Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;</i></p>

<p>And till so much blood thither come again</p>

<p>   <i>Have I not reason to look pale and dead?</i></p>

<p>All souls that will be safe, fly from my side,</p>

<p>For time hath set a blot upon my pride.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>Comfort, my liege. Remember who you are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>I had forgot myself. Am I not king?</p>

<p>Awake, thou coward majesty, thou sleepest!</p>

<p>Is not the King’s name twenty thousand names?</p>

<p>Arm, arm, my name! A puny subject strikes</p>

<p>At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,</p>

<p>You favorites of a king. Are we not high?</p>

<p>High be our thoughts. I know my Uncle York</p>

<p>Hath power enough to serve our turn.–But who</p>

<p>comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Scroop.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Scroop</span></p>

<p>More health and happiness betide my liege</p>

<p>Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Mine ear is open and my heart prepared.</p>

<p>The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.</p>

<p>Say, is my kingdom lost? Why, ’twas my care,</p>

<p>And what loss is it to be rid of care?</p>

<p>Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?</p>

<p>Greater he shall not be. If he serve God,</p>

<p>We’ll serve Him too and be his fellow so.</p>

<p>Revolt our subjects? That we cannot mend.</p>

<p>They break their faith to God as well as us.</p>

<p>Cry woe, destruction, ruin, and decay.</p>

<p>The worst is death, and death will have his day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Scroop</span></p>

<p>Glad am I that your Highness is so armed</p>

<p>To bear the tidings of calamity.</p>

<p>Like an unseasonable stormy day</p>

<p>Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores</p>

<p>As if the world were all dissolved to tears,</p>

<p>So high above his limits swells the rage</p>

<p>Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land</p>

<p>With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.</p>

<p>Whitebeards have armed their thin and hairless</p>

<p>scalps</p>

<p>Against thy Majesty; boys with women’s voices</p>

<p>Strive to speak big and clap their female joints</p>

<p>In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;</p>

<p>Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows</p>

<p>Of double-fatal yew against thy state.</p>

<p>Yea, distaff women manage rusty bills</p>

<p>Against thy seat. Both young and old rebel,</p>

<p>And all goes worse than I have power to tell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Too well, too well thou tell’st a tale so ill.</p>

<p>Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?</p>

<p>What is become of Bushy? Where is Green,</p>

<p>That they have let the dangerous enemy</p>

<p>Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?</p>

<p>If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it!</p>

<p>I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Scroop</span></p>

<p>Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>O villains, vipers, damned without redemption!</p>

<p>Dogs easily won to fawn on any man!</p>

<p>Snakes in my heart blood warmed, that sting my</p>

<p>heart!</p>

<p>Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!</p>

<p>Would they make peace? Terrible hell</p>

<p>Make war upon their spotted souls for this!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Scroop</span></p>

<p>Sweet love, I see, changing his property,</p>

<p>Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.</p>

<p>Again uncurse their souls. Their peace is made</p>

<p>With heads and not with hands. Those whom you</p>

<p>curse</p>

<p>Have felt the worst of death’s destroying wound</p>

<p>And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Scroop</span></p>

<p>Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>Where is the Duke my father with his power?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>No matter where. Of comfort no man speak.</p>

<p>Let’s talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs,</p>

<p>Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes</p>

<p>Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.</p>

<p>Let’s choose executors and talk of wills.</p>

<p>And yet not so, for what can we bequeath</p>

<p>Save our deposed bodies to the ground?</p>

<p>Our lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke’s,</p>

<p>And nothing can we call our own but death</p>

<p>And that small model of the barren earth</p>

<p>Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.</p>

<p>For God’s sake, let us sit upon the ground</p>

<p>And tell sad stories of the death of kings–</p>

<p>How some have been deposed, some slain in war,</p>

<p>Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed,</p>

<p>Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping killed,</p>

<p>All murdered. For within the hollow crown</p>

<p>That rounds the mortal temples of a king</p>

<p>Keeps Death his court, and there the antic sits,</p>

<p>Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,</p>

<p>Allowing him a breath, a little scene,</p>

<p>To monarchize, be feared, and kill with looks,</p>

<p>Infusing him with self and vain conceit,</p>

<p>As if this flesh which walls about our life</p>

<p>Were brass impregnable; and humored thus,</p>

<p>Comes at the last and with a little pin</p>

<p>Bores through his castle wall, and farewell, king!</p>

<p>Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood</p>

<p>With solemn reverence. Throw away respect,</p>

<p>Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,</p>

<p>For you have but mistook me all this while.</p>

<p>I live with bread like you, feel want,</p>

<p>Taste grief, need friends. Subjected thus,</p>

<p>How can you say to me I am a king?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Carlisle</span></p>

<p>My lord, wise men ne’er sit and wail their woes,</p>

<p>But presently prevent the ways to wail.</p>

<p>To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,</p>

<p>Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,</p>

<p>And so your follies fight against yourself.</p>

<p>Fear, and be slain–no worse can come to fight;</p>

<p>And fight and die is death destroying death,</p>

<p>Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>My father hath a power. Inquire of him,</p>

<p>And learn to make a body of a limb.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Thou chid’st me well.–Proud Bolingbroke, I come</p>

<p>To change blows with thee for our day of doom.–</p>

<p>This ague fit of fear is overblown.</p>

<p>An easy task it is to win our own.–</p>

<p>Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?</p>

<p>Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Scroop</span></p>

<p>Men judge by the complexion of the sky</p>

<p>   <i>The state and inclination of the day;</i></p>

<p>So may you by my dull and heavy eye.</p>

<p>   <i>My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.</i></p>

<p>I play the torturer by small and small</p>

<p>To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken.</p>

<p>Your uncle York is joined with Bolingbroke,</p>

<p>And all your northern castles yielded up,</p>

<p>And all your southern gentlemen in arms</p>

<p>Upon his party.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Thou hast said enough.</p>

<p><i>[To Aumerle.]</i> Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst</p>

<p>lead me forth</p>

<p>Of that sweet way I was in to despair.</p>

<p>What say you now? What comfort have we now?</p>

<p>By heaven, I’ll hate him everlastingly</p>

<p>That bids me be of comfort anymore.</p>

<p>Go to Flint Castle. There I’ll pine away;</p>

<p>A king, woe’s slave, shall kingly woe obey.</p>

<p>That power I have, discharge, and let them go</p>

<p>To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,</p>

<p>For I have none. Let no man speak again</p>

<p>To alter this, for counsel is but vain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>My liege, one word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span>  He does me double wrong</p>

<p>That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.</p>

<p>Discharge my followers. Let them hence away,</p>

<p>From Richard’s night to Bolingbroke’s fair day.</p>
