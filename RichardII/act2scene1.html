<p><center><i>[Enter John of Gaunt sick, with the Duke of York, and</p>

<p>Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>Will the King come, that I may breathe my last</p>

<p>In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath,</p>

<p>For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>O, but they say the tongues of dying men</p>

<p>Enforce attention like deep harmony.</p>

<p>Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in</p>

<p>vain,</p>

<p>For they breathe truth that breathe their words in</p>

<p>pain.</p>

<p>He that no more must say is listened more</p>

<p>   <i>Than they whom youth and ease have taught to</i></p>

<p>   <i>gloze.</i></p>

<p>More are men’s ends marked than their lives before.</p>

<p>   <i>The setting sun and music at the close,</i></p>

<p>As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,</p>

<p>Writ in remembrance more than things long past.</p>

<p>Though Richard my life’s counsel would not hear,</p>

<p>My death’s sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>No, it is stopped with other flattering sounds,</p>

<p>As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond;</p>

<p>Lascivious meters, to whose venom sound</p>

<p>The open ear of youth doth always listen;</p>

<p>Report of fashions in proud Italy,</p>

<p>Whose manners still our tardy-apish nation</p>

<p>Limps after in base imitation.</p>

<p>Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity–</p>

<p>So it be new, there’s no respect how vile–</p>

<p>That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?</p>

<p>Then all too late comes counsel to be heard</p>

<p>Where will doth mutiny with wit’s regard.</p>

<p>Direct not him whose way himself will choose.</p>

<p>’Tis breath thou lack’st, and that breath wilt thou</p>

<p>lose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>Methinks I am a prophet new inspired</p>

<p>And thus expiring do foretell of him:</p>

<p>His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,</p>

<p>For violent fires soon burn out themselves;</p>

<p>Small showers last long, but sudden storms are</p>

<p>short;</p>

<p>He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;</p>

<p>With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder;</p>

<p>Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,</p>

<p>Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.</p>

<p>This royal throne of kings, this sceptered isle,</p>

<p>This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,</p>

<p>This other Eden, demi-paradise,</p>

<p>This fortress built by Nature for herself</p>

<p>Against infection and the hand of war,</p>

<p>This happy breed of men, this little world,</p>

<p>This precious stone set in the silver sea,</p>

<p>Which serves it in the office of a wall</p>

<p>Or as a moat defensive to a house,</p>

<p>Against the envy of less happier lands,</p>

<p>This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this</p>

<p>England,</p>

<p>This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,</p>

<p>Feared by their breed and famous by their birth,</p>

<p>Renowned for their deeds as far from home</p>

<p>For Christian service and true chivalry</p>

<p>As is the sepulcher in stubborn Jewry</p>

<p>Of the world’s ransom, blessed Mary’s son,</p>

<p>This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,</p>

<p>Dear for her reputation through the world,</p>

<p>Is now leased out–I die pronouncing it–</p>

<p>Like to a tenement or pelting farm.</p>

<p>England, bound in with the triumphant sea,</p>

<p>Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege</p>

<p>Of wat’ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,</p>

<p>With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds.</p>

<p>That England that was wont to conquer others</p>

<p>Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.</p>

<p>Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,</p>

<p>How happy then were my ensuing death!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King and Queen, Aumerle, Bushy, Green, Bagot,</p>

<p>Ross, Willoughby, etc.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>The King is come. Deal mildly with his youth,</p>

<p>For young hot colts being reined do rage the more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <i>[to Gaunt]</i></p>

<p>How fares our noble uncle Lancaster?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc> <i>[to Gaunt]</i></p>

<p>What comfort, man? How is ’t with aged Gaunt?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>O, how that name befits my composition!</p>

<p>Old Gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old.</p>

<p>Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast,</p>

<p>And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?</p>

<p>For sleeping England long time have I watched;</p>

<p>Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt.</p>

<p>The pleasure that some fathers feed upon</p>

<p>Is my strict fast–I mean my children’s looks–</p>

<p>And, therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt.</p>

<p>Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,</p>

<p>Whose hollow womb inherits naught but bones.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Can sick men play so nicely with their names?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>No, misery makes sport to mock itself.</p>

<p>Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,</p>

<p>I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Should dying men flatter with those that live?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>No, no, men living flatter those that die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flatterest me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>O, no, thou diest, though I the sicker be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>Now He that made me knows I see thee ill,</p>

<p>Ill in myself to see, and in thee, seeing ill.</p>

<p>Thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land,</p>

<p>Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;</p>

<p>And thou, too careless-patient as thou art,</p>

<p>Commit’st thy anointed body to the cure</p>

<p>Of those physicians that first wounded thee.</p>

<p>A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,</p>

<p>Whose compass is no bigger than thy head,</p>

<p>And yet encaged in so small a verge,</p>

<p>The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.</p>

<p>O, had thy grandsire with a prophet’s eye</p>

<p>Seen how his son’s son should destroy his sons,</p>

<p>From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,</p>

<p>Deposing thee before thou wert possessed,</p>

<p>Which art possessed now to depose thyself.</p>

<p>Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,</p>

<p>It were a shame to let this land by lease;</p>

<p>But, for thy world enjoying but this land,</p>

<p>Is it not more than shame to shame it so?</p>

<p>Landlord of England art thou now, not king.</p>

<p>Thy state of law is bondslave to the law,</p>

<p>And thou–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc>  A lunatic lean-witted fool,</p>

<p>Presuming on an ague’s privilege,</p>

<p>Darest with thy frozen admonition</p>

<p>Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood</p>

<p>With fury from his native residence.</p>

<p>Now, by my seat’s right royal majesty,</p>

<p>Wert thou not brother to great Edward’s son,</p>

<p>This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head</p>

<p>Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>O, spare me not, my brother Edward’s son,</p>

<p>For that I was his father Edward’s son!</p>

<p>That blood already, like the pelican,</p>

<p>Hast thou tapped out and drunkenly caroused.</p>

<p>My brother Gloucester–plain, well-meaning soul,</p>

<p>Whom fair befall in heaven ’mongst happy souls–</p>

<p>May be a precedent and witness good</p>

<p>That thou respect’st not spilling Edward’s blood.</p>

<p>Join with the present sickness that I have,</p>

<p>And thy unkindness be like crooked age</p>

<p>To crop at once a too-long withered flower.</p>

<p>Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!</p>

<p>These words hereafter thy tormentors be!–</p>

<p>Convey me to my bed, then to my grave.</p>

<p>Love they to live that love and honor have.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits, carried off by Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>And let them die that age and sullens have,</p>

<p>For both hast thou, and both become the grave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>I do beseech your Majesty, impute his words</p>

<p>To wayward sickliness and age in him.</p>

<p>He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear</p>

<p>As Harry, Duke of Hereford, were he here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Right, you say true: as Hereford’s love, so his;</p>

<p>As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Northumberland.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>What says he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc>  Nay, nothing; all is said.</p>

<p>His tongue is now a stringless instrument;</p>

<p>Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!</p>

<p>Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;</p>

<p>His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.</p>

<p>So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:</p>

<p>We must supplant those rough rugheaded kern,</p>

<p>Which live like venom where no venom else</p>

<p>But only they have privilege to live.</p>

<p>And, for these great affairs do ask some charge,</p>

<p>Towards our assistance we do seize to us</p>

<p>The plate, coin, revenues, and movables</p>

<p>Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possessed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long</p>

<p>Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?</p>

<p>Not Gloucester’s death, nor Hereford’s banishment,</p>

<p>Nor Gaunt’s rebukes, nor England’s private wrongs,</p>

<p>Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke</p>

<p>About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,</p>

<p>Have ever made me sour my patient cheek</p>

<p>Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign’s face.</p>

<p>I am the last of noble Edward’s sons,</p>

<p>Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first.</p>

<p>In war was never lion raged more fierce,</p>

<p>In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,</p>

<p>Than was that young and princely gentleman.</p>

<p>His face thou hast, for even so looked he,</p>

<p>Accomplished with the number of thy hours;</p>

<p>But when he frowned, it was against the French</p>

<p>And not against his friends. His noble hand</p>

<p>Did win what he did spend, and spent not that</p>

<p>Which his triumphant father’s hand had won.</p>

<p>His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,</p>

<p>But bloody with the enemies of his kin.</p>

<p>O, Richard! York is too far gone with grief,</p>

<p>Or else he never would compare between.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Why, uncle, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc>  O, my liege,</p>

<p>Pardon me if you please. If not, I, pleased</p>

<p>Not to be pardoned, am content withal.</p>

<p>Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands</p>

<p>The royalties and rights of banished Hereford?</p>

<p>Is not Gaunt dead? And doth not Hereford live?</p>

<p>Was not Gaunt just? And is not Harry true?</p>

<p>Did not the one deserve to have an heir?</p>

<p>Is not his heir a well-deserving son?</p>

<p>Take Hereford’s rights away, and take from time</p>

<p>His charters and his customary rights;</p>

<p>Let not tomorrow then ensue today;</p>

<p>Be not thyself; for how art thou a king</p>

<p>But by fair sequence and succession?</p>

<p>Now afore God–God forbid I say true!–</p>

<p>If you do wrongfully seize Hereford’s rights,</p>

<p>Call in the letters patents that he hath</p>

<p>By his attorneys general to sue</p>

<p>His livery, and deny his offered homage,</p>

<p>You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,</p>

<p>You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts,</p>

<p>And prick my tender patience to those thoughts</p>

<p>Which honor and allegiance cannot think.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Think what you will, we seize into our hands</p>

<p>His plate, his goods, his money, and his lands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>I’ll not be by the while. My liege, farewell.</p>

<p>What will ensue hereof there’s none can tell;</p>

<p>But by bad courses may be understood</p>

<p>That their events can never fall out good.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight.</p>

<p>Bid him repair to us to Ely House</p>

<p>To see this business. Tomorrow next</p>

<p>We will for Ireland, and ’tis time, I trow.</p>

<p>And we create, in absence of ourself,</p>

<p>Our uncle York Lord Governor of England,</p>

<p>For he is just and always loved us well.–</p>

<p>Come on, our queen. Tomorrow must we part.</p>

<p>Be merry, for our time of stay is short.</p>

<p><center><i>[King and Queen exit with others;</p>

<p>Northumberland, Willoughby, and Ross remain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc></p>

<p>And living too, for now his son is duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Willoughby</sc></p>

<p>Barely in title, not in revenues.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Richly in both, if justice had her right.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc></p>

<p>My heart is great, but it must break with silence</p>

<p>Ere ’t be disburdened with a liberal tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Nay, speak thy mind, and let him ne’er speak more</p>

<p>That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Willoughby</sc> <i>[to Ross]</i></p>

<p>Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of</p>

<p>Hereford?</p>

<p>If it be so, out with it boldly, man.</p>

<p>Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc></p>

<p>No good at all that I can do for him,</p>

<p>Unless you call it good to pity him,</p>

<p>Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Now, afore God, ’tis shame such wrongs are borne</p>

<p>In him, a royal prince, and many more</p>

<p>Of noble blood in this declining land.</p>

<p>The King is not himself, but basely led</p>

<p>By flatterers; and what they will inform</p>

<p>Merely in hate ’gainst any of us all,</p>

<p>That will the King severely prosecute</p>

<p>’Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc></p>

<p>The commons hath he pilled with grievous taxes,</p>

<p>And quite lost their hearts. The nobles hath he fined</p>

<p>For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Willoughby</sc></p>

<p>And daily new exactions are devised,</p>

<p>As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what.</p>

<p>But what i’ God’s name doth become of this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Wars hath not wasted it, for warred he hath not,</p>

<p>But basely yielded upon compromise</p>

<p>That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows.</p>

<p>More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc></p>

<p>The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Willoughby</sc></p>

<p>The King grown bankrupt like a broken man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc></p>

<p>He hath not money for these Irish wars,</p>

<p>His burdenous taxations notwithstanding,</p>

<p>But by the robbing of the banished duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>His noble kinsman. Most degenerate king!</p>

<p>But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,</p>

<p>Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm;</p>

<p>We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,</p>

<p>And yet we strike not, but securely perish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc></p>

<p>We see the very wrack that we must suffer,</p>

<p>And unavoided is the danger now</p>

<p>For suffering so the causes of our wrack.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Not so. Even through the hollow eyes of death</p>

<p>I spy life peering; but I dare not say</p>

<p>How near the tidings of our comfort is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Willoughby</sc></p>

<p>Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc></p>

<p>Be confident to speak, Northumberland.</p>

<p>We three are but thyself, and speaking so</p>

<p>Thy words are but as thoughts. Therefore be bold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc,</p>

<p>A bay in Brittany, received intelligence</p>

<p>That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord</p>

<p>Cobham,</p>

<p>That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,</p>

<p>His brother, archbishop late of Canterbury,</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,</p>

<p>Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton, and Francis</p>

<p>Coint–</p>

<p>All these well furnished by the Duke of Brittany</p>

<p>With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,</p>

<p>Are making hither with all due expedience</p>

<p>And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.</p>

<p>Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay</p>

<p>The first departing of the King for Ireland.</p>

<p>If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,</p>

<p>Imp out our drooping country’s broken wing,</p>

<p>Redeem from broking pawn the blemished crown,</p>

<p>Wipe off the dust that hides our scepter’s gilt,</p>

<p>And make high majesty look like itself,</p>

<p>Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh.</p>

<p>But if you faint, as fearing to do so,</p>

<p>Stay and be secret, and myself will go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ross</sc></p>

<p>To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Willoughby</sc></p>

<p>Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.</p>
