<p><center><i>[Enter with Drum and Colors Bolingbroke, York,</p>

<p>Northumberland, with Soldiers and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>So that by this intelligence we learn</p>

<p>The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury</p>

<p>Is gone to meet the King, who lately landed</p>

<p>With some few private friends upon this coast.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>The news is very fair and good, my lord:</p>

<p>Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>It would beseem the Lord Northumberland</p>

<p>To say “King Richard.” Alack the heavy day</p>

<p>When such a sacred king should hide his head!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief</p>

<p>Left I his title out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>The time hath been, would you have been so brief</p>

<p>with him,</p>

<p>He would have been so brief to shorten you,</p>

<p>For taking so the head, your whole head’s length.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Take not, good cousin, further than you should,</p>

<p>Lest you mistake. The heavens are over our heads.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself</p>

<p>Against their will. But who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Percy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Welcome, Harry. What, will not this castle yield?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Percy</sc></p>

<p>The castle royally is manned, my lord,</p>

<p>Against thy entrance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Royally? Why, it contains no king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Percy</sc>  Yes, my good lord,</p>

<p>It doth contain a king. King Richard lies</p>

<p>Within the limits of yon lime and stone,</p>

<p>And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,</p>

<p>Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman</p>

<p>Of holy reverence–who, I cannot learn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc> <i>[to Northumberland]</i>  Noble lord,</p>

<p>Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle,</p>

<p>Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley</p>

<p>Into his ruined ears, and thus deliver:</p>

<p>Henry Bolingbroke</p>

<p>On both his knees doth kiss King Richard’s hand</p>

<p>And sends allegiance and true faith of heart</p>

<p>To his most royal person, hither come</p>

<p>Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,</p>

<p>Provided that my banishment repealed</p>

<p>And lands restored again be freely granted.</p>

<p>If not, I’ll use the advantage of my power</p>

<p>And lay the summer’s dust with showers of blood</p>

<p>Rained from the wounds of slaughtered</p>

<p>Englishmen–</p>

<p>The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke</p>

<p>It is such crimson tempest should bedrench</p>

<p>The fresh green lap of fair King Richard’s land,</p>

<p>My stooping duty tenderly shall show.</p>

<p>Go signify as much while here we march</p>

<p>Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.</p>

<p><center><i>[Northumberland and Trumpets</p>

<p>approach the battlements.]</i></center></p>

<p>Let’s march without the noise of threat’ning drum,</p>

<p>That from this castle’s tottered battlements</p>

<p>Our fair appointments may be well perused.</p>

<p>Methinks King Richard and myself should meet</p>

<p>With no less terror than the elements</p>

<p>Of fire and water when their thund’ring shock</p>

<p>At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.</p>

<p>Be he the fire, I’ll be the yielding water;</p>

<p>The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain</p>

<p>My waters–on the earth and not on him.</p>

<p>March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bolingbroke’s Soldiers march, the trumpets sound.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Richard appeareth on the walls with Aumerle.]</i></center></p>

<p>See, see, King Richard doth himself appear</p>

<p>As doth the blushing discontented sun</p>

<p>From out the fiery portal of the east</p>

<p>When he perceives the envious clouds are bent</p>

<p>To dim his glory and to stain the track</p>

<p>Of his bright passage to the occident.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Yet looks he like a king. Behold, his eye,</p>

<p>As bright as is the eagle’s, lightens forth</p>

<p>Controlling majesty. Alack, alack for woe</p>

<p>That any harm should stain so fair a show!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc> <i>[to Northumberland, below]</i></p>

<p>We are amazed, and thus long have we stood</p>

<p>To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,</p>

<p>Because we thought ourself thy lawful king.</p>

<p>An if we be, how dare thy joints forget</p>

<p>To pay their awful duty to our presence?</p>

<p>If we be not, show us the hand of God</p>

<p>That hath dismissed us from our stewardship,</p>

<p>For well we know no hand of blood and bone</p>

<p>Can gripe the sacred handle of our scepter,</p>

<p>Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.</p>

<p>And though you think that all, as you have done,</p>

<p>Have torn their souls by turning them from us,</p>

<p>And we are barren and bereft of friends,</p>

<p>Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,</p>

<p>Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf</p>

<p>Armies of pestilence, and they shall strike</p>

<p>Your children yet unborn and unbegot,</p>

<p>That lift your vassal hands against my head</p>

<p>And threat the glory of my precious crown.</p>

<p>Tell Bolingbroke–for yon methinks he stands–</p>

<p>That every stride he makes upon my land</p>

<p>Is dangerous treason. He is come to open</p>

<p>The purple testament of bleeding war;</p>

<p>But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,</p>

<p>Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers’ sons</p>

<p>Shall ill become the flower of England’s face,</p>

<p>Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace</p>

<p>To scarlet indignation, and bedew</p>

<p>Her pastures’ grass with faithful English blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>The King of heaven forbid our lord the King</p>

<p>Should so with civil and uncivil arms</p>

<p>Be rushed upon! Thy thrice-noble cousin,</p>

<p>Harry Bolingbroke, doth humbly kiss thy hand,</p>

<p>And by the honorable tomb he swears</p>

<p>That stands upon your royal grandsire’s bones,</p>

<p>And by the royalties of both your bloods,</p>

<p>Currents that spring from one most gracious head,</p>

<p>And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,</p>

<p>And by the worth and honor of himself,</p>

<p>Comprising all that may be sworn or said,</p>

<p>His coming hither hath no further scope</p>

<p>Than for his lineal royalties, and to beg</p>

<p>Enfranchisement immediate on his knees;</p>

<p>Which on thy royal party granted once,</p>

<p>His glittering arms he will commend to rust,</p>

<p>His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart</p>

<p>To faithful service of your Majesty.</p>

<p>This swears he, as he is a prince and just,</p>

<p>And as I am a gentleman I credit him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Northumberland, say thus the King returns:</p>

<p>His noble cousin is right welcome hither,</p>

<p>And all the number of his fair demands</p>

<p>Shall be accomplished without contradiction.</p>

<p>With all the gracious utterance thou hast,</p>

<p>Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.</p>

<p><center><i>[Northumberland returns to Bolingbroke.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Aumerle.]</i> We do debase ourselves, cousin, do</p>

<p>we not,</p>

<p>To look so poorly and to speak so fair?</p>

<p>Shall we call back Northumberland and send</p>

<p>Defiance to the traitor and so die?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc></p>

<p>No, good my lord, let’s fight with gentle words,</p>

<p>Till time lend friends, and friends their helpful</p>

<p>swords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>O God, O God, that e’er this tongue of mine</p>

<p>That laid the sentence of dread banishment</p>

<p>On yon proud man should take it off again</p>

<p>With words of sooth! O, that I were as great</p>

<p>As is my grief, or lesser than my name!</p>

<p>Or that I could forget what I have been,</p>

<p>Or not remember what I must be now.</p>

<p>Swell’st thou, proud heart? I’ll give thee scope to</p>

<p>beat,</p>

<p>Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc></p>

<p>Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>What must the King do now? Must he submit?</p>

<p>The King shall do it. Must he be deposed?</p>

<p>The King shall be contented. Must he lose</p>

<p>The name of king? I’ God’s name, let it go.</p>

<p>I’ll give my jewels for a set of beads,</p>

<p>My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,</p>

<p>My gay apparel for an almsman’s gown,</p>

<p>My figured goblets for a dish of wood,</p>

<p>My scepter for a palmer’s walking-staff,</p>

<p>My subjects for a pair of carved saints,</p>

<p>And my large kingdom for a little grave,</p>

<p>A little, little grave, an obscure grave;</p>

<p>Or I’ll be buried in the King’s highway,</p>

<p>Some way of common trade, where subjects’ feet</p>

<p>May hourly trample on their sovereign’s head;</p>

<p>For on my heart they tread now whilst I live</p>

<p>And, buried once, why not upon my head?</p>

<p>Aumerle, thou weep’st, my tender-hearted cousin.</p>

<p>We’ll make foul weather with despised tears;</p>

<p>Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn</p>

<p>And make a dearth in this revolting land.</p>

<p>Or shall we play the wantons with our woes</p>

<p>And make some pretty match with shedding tears?</p>

<p>As thus, to drop them still upon one place</p>

<p>Till they have fretted us a pair of graves</p>

<p>Within the earth; and therein laid–there lies</p>

<p>Two kinsmen digged their graves with weeping eyes.</p>

<p>Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see</p>

<p>I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Northumberland approaches the battlements.]</i></center></p>

<p>Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,</p>

<p>What says King Bolingbroke? Will his Majesty</p>

<p>Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?</p>

<p>You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>My lord, in the base court he doth attend</p>

<p>To speak with you, may it please you to come down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Down, down I come, like glist’ring Phaeton,</p>

<p>Wanting the manage of unruly jades.</p>

<p>In the base court–base court, where kings grow</p>

<p>base,</p>

<p>To come at traitors’ calls and do them grace.</p>

<p>In the base court come down–down court, down</p>

<p>king,</p>

<p>For nightowls shriek where mounting larks should</p>

<p>sing.</p>

<p><center><i>[Richard exits above</p>

<p>and Northumberland returns to Bolingbroke.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc>  What says his Majesty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc>  Sorrow and grief of heart</p>

<p>Makes him speak fondly like a frantic man,</p>

<p>Yet he is come.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Richard enters below.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc>  Stand all apart,</p>

<p>And show fair duty to his Majesty.     <i><i>[He kneels down.]</i></i></p>

<p>My gracious lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee</p>

<p>To make the base earth proud with kissing it.</p>

<p>Me rather had my heart might feel your love</p>

<p>Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.</p>

<p>Up, cousin, up. Your heart is up, I know,</p>

<p>Thus high at least <i>[indicating his crown,]</i> although</p>

<p>your knee be low.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc> <i>[standing]</i></p>

<p>My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,</p>

<p>As my true service shall deserve your love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Well you deserve. They well deserve to have</p>

<p>That know the strong’st and surest way to get.–</p>

<p>Uncle, give me your hands. Nay, dry your eyes.</p>

<p>Tears show their love but want their remedies.–</p>

<p>Cousin, I am too young to be your father,</p>

<p>Though you are old enough to be my heir.</p>

<p>What you will have I’ll give, and willing too,</p>

<p>For do we must what force will have us do.</p>

<p>Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Yea, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc>  Then I must not say no.</p>
