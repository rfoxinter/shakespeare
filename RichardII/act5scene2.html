<p><center><i>[Enter Duke of York and the Duchess.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,</p>

<p>When weeping made you break the story off</p>

<p>Of our two cousins coming into London.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Where did I leave?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span>  At that sad stop, my lord,</p>

<p>Where rude misgoverned hands from windows’ tops</p>

<p>Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard’s head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bolingbroke,</p>

<p>Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed,</p>

<p>Which his aspiring rider seemed to know,</p>

<p>With slow but stately pace kept on his course,</p>

<p>Whilst all tongues cried “God save thee,</p>

<p>Bolingbroke!”</p>

<p>You would have thought the very windows spake,</p>

<p>So many greedy looks of young and old</p>

<p>Through casements darted their desiring eyes</p>

<p>Upon his visage, and that all the walls</p>

<p>With painted imagery had said at once</p>

<p>“Jesu preserve thee! Welcome, Bolingbroke!”</p>

<p>Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,</p>

<p>Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed’s neck,</p>

<p>Bespake them thus: “I thank you, countrymen.”</p>

<p>And thus still doing, thus he passed along.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>Alack, poor Richard! Where rode he the whilst?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>As in a theater the eyes of men,</p>

<p>After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,</p>

<p>Are idly bent on him that enters next,</p>

<p>Thinking his prattle to be tedious,</p>

<p>Even so, or with much more contempt, men’s eyes</p>

<p>Did scowl on gentle Richard. No man cried “God</p>

<p>save him!”</p>

<p>No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home,</p>

<p>But dust was thrown upon his sacred head,</p>

<p>Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,</p>

<p>His face still combating with tears and smiles,</p>

<p>The badges of his grief and patience,</p>

<p>That had not God for some strong purpose steeled</p>

<p>The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,</p>

<p>And barbarism itself have pitied him.</p>

<p>But heaven hath a hand in these events,</p>

<p>To whose high will we bound our calm contents.</p>

<p>To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,</p>

<p>Whose state and honor I for aye allow.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Aumerle.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>Here comes my son Aumerle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  Aumerle that was;</p>

<p>But that is lost for being Richard’s friend,</p>

<p>And, madam, you must call him Rutland now.</p>

<p>I am in parliament pledge for his truth</p>

<p>And lasting fealty to the new-made king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>Welcome, my son. Who are the violets now</p>

<p>That strew the green lap of the new-come spring?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not.</p>

<p>God knows I had as lief be none as one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,</p>

<p>Lest you be cropped before you come to prime.</p>

<p>What news from Oxford? Do these jousts and</p>

<p>triumphs hold?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span>  For aught I know, my lord, they do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  You will be there, I know.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span>  If God prevent not, I purpose so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>What seal is that that hangs without thy bosom?</p>

<p>Yea, lookst thou pale? Let me see the writing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>My lord, ’tis nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  No matter, then, who see it.</p>

<p>I will be satisfied. Let me see the writing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>I do beseech your Grace to pardon me.</p>

<p>It is a matter of small consequence,</p>

<p>Which for some reasons I would not have seen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.</p>

<p>I fear, I fear–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span>  What should you fear?</p>

<p>’Tis nothing but some bond that he is entered into</p>

<p>For gay apparel ’gainst the triumph day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Bound to himself? What doth he with a bond</p>

<p>That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.–</p>

<p>Boy, let me see the writing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>I do beseech you, pardon me. I may not show it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>I will be satisfied. Let me see it, I say.</p>

<p><center><i>[He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Treason! Foul treason! Villain, traitor, slave!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span>  What is the matter, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span> <i>[calling offstage]</i></p>

<p>Ho, who is within there? Saddle my horse!–</p>

<p>God for his mercy, what treachery is here!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span>  Why, what is it, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span> <i>[calling offstage]</i></p>

<p>Give me my boots, I say! Saddle my horse!–</p>

<p>Now by mine honor, by my life, by my troth,</p>

<p>I will appeach the villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span>  What is the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  Peace, foolish woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>I will not peace!–What is the matter, Aumerle?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aumerle</span></p>

<p>Good mother, be content. It is no more</p>

<p>Than my poor life must answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span>  Thy life answer?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span> <i>[calling offstage]</i></p>

<p>Bring me my boots!–I will unto the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[His man enters with his boots.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>Strike him, Aumerle! Poor boy, thou art amazed.–</p>

<p>Hence, villain, never more come in my sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  Give me my boots, I say.</p>

<p><center><i>[His man helps him on with his boots, then exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span>  Why, York, what wilt thou do?</p>

<p>Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?</p>

<p>Have we more sons? Or are we like to have?</p>

<p>Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?</p>

<p>And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age</p>

<p>And rob me of a happy mother’s name?</p>

<p>Is he not like thee? Is he not thine own?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  Thou fond mad woman,</p>

<p>Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?</p>

<p>A dozen of them here have ta’en the sacrament</p>

<p>And interchangeably set down their hands</p>

<p>To kill the King at Oxford.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>He shall be none. We’ll keep him here.</p>

<p>Then what is that to him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Away, fond woman! Were he twenty times my son,</p>

<p>I would appeach him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>Hadst thou groaned for him as I have done,</p>

<p>Thou wouldst be more pitiful.</p>

<p>But now I know thy mind: thou dost suspect</p>

<p>That I have been disloyal to thy bed</p>

<p>And that he is a bastard, not thy son.</p>

<p>Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind!</p>

<p>He is as like thee as a man may be,</p>

<p>Not like to me or any of my kin,</p>

<p>And yet I love him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  Make way, unruly woman!</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>After, Aumerle! Mount thee upon his horse,</p>

<p>Spur post, and get before him to the King,</p>

<p>And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.</p>

<p>I’ll not be long behind. Though I be old,</p>

<p>I doubt not but to ride as fast as York.</p>

<p>And never will I rise up from the ground</p>

<p>Till Bolingbroke have pardoned thee. Away, begone!</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
