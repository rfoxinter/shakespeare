<p><center><i>[Enter the King with his Nobles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?</p>

<p>’Tis full three months since I did see him last.</p>

<p>If any plague hang over us, ’tis he.</p>

<p>I would to God, my lords, he might be found.</p>

<p>Inquire at London, ’mongst the taverns there,</p>

<p>For there, they say, he daily doth frequent</p>

<p>With unrestrained loose companions,</p>

<p>Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes</p>

<p>And beat our watch and rob our passengers,</p>

<p>While he, young wanton and effeminate boy,</p>

<p>Takes on the point of honor to support</p>

<p>So dissolute a crew.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Percy</sc></p>

<p>My lord, some two days since I saw the Prince,</p>

<p>And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  And what said the gallant?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Percy</sc></p>

<p>His answer was, he would unto the stews,</p>

<p>And from the common’st creature pluck a glove</p>

<p>And wear it as a favor, and with that</p>

<p>He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>As dissolute as desperate. Yet through both</p>

<p>I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years</p>

<p>May happily bring forth. But who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Aumerle amazed.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc>  Where is the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>What means our cousin, that he stares and looks so</p>

<p>wildly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc></p>

<p>God save your Grace. I do beseech your Majesty</p>

<p>To have some conference with your Grace alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc> <i>[to his Nobles]</i></p>

<p>Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Nobles exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>What is the matter with our cousin now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Forever may my knees grow to the earth,</p>

<p>My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth,</p>

<p>Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Intended or committed was this fault?</p>

<p>If on the first, how heinous e’er it be,</p>

<p>To win thy after-love I pardon thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc> <i>[standing]</i></p>

<p>Then give me leave that I may turn the key</p>

<p>That no man enter till my tale be done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Have thy desire.     <i><i>[Aumerle locks the door.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[The Duke of York knocks at the door and crieth.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>My liege, beware! Look to thyself!</p>

<p>Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc> <i>[to Aumerle]</i>  Villain, I’ll make thee safe.</p>

<p><center><i>[He draws his sword.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc></p>

<p>Stay thy revengeful hand. Thou hast no cause to fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Open the door, secure, foolhardy king!</p>

<p>Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?</p>

<p>Open the door, or I will break it open.</p>

<p><center><i>[King Henry unlocks the door.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter York.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  What is the matter, uncle? Speak.</p>

<p>Recover breath. Tell us how near is danger</p>

<p>That we may arm us to encounter it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc> <i>[giving King Henry a paper]</i></p>

<p>Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know</p>

<p>The treason that my haste forbids me show.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc> <i>[to King Henry]</i></p>

<p>Remember, as thou read’st, thy promise passed.</p>

<p>I do repent me. Read not my name there.</p>

<p>My heart is not confederate with my hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.–</p>

<p>I tore it from the traitor’s bosom, king.</p>

<p>Fear, and not love, begets his penitence.</p>

<p>Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove</p>

<p>A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>O heinous, strong, and bold conspiracy!</p>

<p>O loyal father of a treacherous son,</p>

<p>Thou sheer, immaculate, and silver fountain</p>

<p>From whence this stream, through muddy passages,</p>

<p>Hath held his current and defiled himself,</p>

<p>Thy overflow of good converts to bad,</p>

<p>And thy abundant goodness shall excuse</p>

<p>This deadly blot in thy digressing son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>So shall my virtue be his vice’s bawd,</p>

<p>And he shall spend mine honor with his shame,</p>

<p>As thriftless sons their scraping fathers’ gold.</p>

<p>Mine honor lives when his dishonor dies,</p>

<p>Or my shamed life in his dishonor lies.</p>

<p>Thou kill’st me in his life: giving him breath,</p>

<p>The traitor lives, the true man’s put to death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>What ho, my liege! For God’s sake, let me in!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>A woman and thy aunt, great king. ’Tis I.</p>

<p>Speak with me, pity me. Open the door!</p>

<p>A beggar begs that never begged before.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Our scene is altered from a serious thing</p>

<p>And now changed to “The Beggar and the King.”–</p>

<p>My dangerous cousin, let your mother in.</p>

<p>I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.</p>

<p><center><i>[Aumerle opens the door.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Duchess of York enters and kneels.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>If thou do pardon whosoever pray,</p>

<p>More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.</p>

<p>This festered joint cut off, the rest rest sound.</p>

<p>This let alone will all the rest confound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>O king, believe not this hard-hearted man.</p>

<p>Love loving not itself, none other can.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?</p>

<p>Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Sweet York, be patient.–Hear me, gentle liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Rise up, good aunt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc>  Not yet, I thee beseech.</p>

<p>Forever will I walk upon my knees</p>

<p>And never see day that the happy sees,</p>

<p>Till thou give joy, until thou bid me joy</p>

<p>By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Unto my mother’s prayers I bend my knee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Against them both my true joints bended be.</p>

<p>Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Pleads he in earnest? Look upon his face.</p>

<p>His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;</p>

<p>His words come from his mouth, ours from our</p>

<p>breast.</p>

<p>He prays but faintly and would be denied.</p>

<p>We pray with heart and soul and all beside.</p>

<p>His weary joints would gladly rise, I know.</p>

<p>Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow.</p>

<p>His prayers are full of false hypocrisy,</p>

<p>Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.</p>

<p>Our prayers do outpray his. Then let them have</p>

<p>That mercy which true prayer ought to have.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Good aunt, stand up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc>  Nay, do not say “stand up.”</p>

<p>Say “pardon” first and afterwards “stand up.”</p>

<p>An if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,</p>

<p>“Pardon” should be the first word of thy speech.</p>

<p>I never longed to hear a word till now.</p>

<p>Say “pardon,” king; let pity teach thee how.</p>

<p>The word is short, but not so short as sweet.</p>

<p>No word like “pardon” for kings’ mouths so meet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Speak it in French, king. Say “pardonne moy.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?</p>

<p>Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,</p>

<p>That sets the word itself against the word!</p>

<p><i>[To King Henry.]</i> Speak “pardon” as ’tis current in</p>

<p>our land;</p>

<p>The chopping French we do not understand.</p>

<p>Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there,</p>

<p>Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear,</p>

<p>That, hearing how our plaints and prayers do</p>

<p>pierce,</p>

<p>Pity may move thee “pardon” to rehearse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Good aunt, stand up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc>  I do not sue to stand.</p>

<p>Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>O, happy vantage of a kneeling knee!</p>

<p>Yet am I sick for fear. Speak it again.</p>

<p>Twice saying “pardon” doth not pardon twain,</p>

<p>But makes one pardon strong.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I pardon him with all my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc>  A god on Earth thou art.</p>

<p><center><i>[They all stand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>But for our trusty brother-in-law and the Abbot,</p>

<p>With all the rest of that consorted crew,</p>

<p>Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.</p>

<p>Good uncle, help to order several powers</p>

<p>To Oxford or where’er these traitors are.</p>

<p>They shall not live within this world, I swear,</p>

<p>But I will have them, if I once know where.</p>

<p>Uncle, farewell,–and cousin, adieu.</p>

<p>Your mother well hath prayed; and prove you true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc> <i>[to Aumerle]</i></p>

<p>Come, my old son. I pray God make thee new.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
