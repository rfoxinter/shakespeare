<p><center><i>[Enter Lord Marshal and the Duke of Aumerle.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marshal</sc></p>

<p>My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford armed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc></p>

<p>Yea, at all points, and longs to enter in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marshal</sc></p>

<p>The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,</p>

<p>Stays but the summons of the appellant’s trumpet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc></p>

<p>Why then, the champions are prepared and stay</p>

<p>For nothing but his Majesty’s approach.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The trumpets sound and the King enters with his Nobles</p>

<p>and Officers; when they are set, enter Mowbray, the</p>

<p>Duke of Norfolk in arms, defendant, with a Herald.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Marshal, demand of yonder champion</p>

<p>The cause of his arrival here in arms,</p>

<p>Ask him his name, and orderly proceed</p>

<p>To swear him in the justice of his cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marshal</sc> <i>[to Mowbray]</i></p>

<p>In God’s name and the King’s, say who thou art</p>

<p>And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,</p>

<p>Against what man thou com’st, and what thy quarrel.</p>

<p>Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath,</p>

<p>As so defend thee heaven and thy valor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mowbray</sc></p>

<p>My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,</p>

<p>Who hither come engaged by my oath–</p>

<p>Which God defend a knight should violate!–</p>

<p>Both to defend my loyalty and truth</p>

<p>To God, my king, and my succeeding issue,</p>

<p>Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me,</p>

<p>And by the grace of God and this mine arm</p>

<p>To prove him, in defending of myself,</p>

<p>A traitor to my God, my king, and me;</p>

<p>And as I truly fight, defend me heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The trumpets sound. Enter Bolingbroke, Duke of</p>

<p>Hereford, appellant, in armor, with a Herald.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc>  Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms</p>

<p>Both who he is and why he cometh hither</p>

<p>Thus plated in habiliments of war,</p>

<p>And formally, according to our law,</p>

<p>Depose him in the justice of his cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marshal</sc> <i>[to Bolingbroke]</i></p>

<p>What is thy name? And wherefore com’st thou hither,</p>

<p>Before King Richard in his royal lists?</p>

<p>Against whom comest thou? And what’s thy quarrel?</p>

<p>Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby</p>

<p>Am I, who ready here do stand in arms</p>

<p>To prove, by God’s grace and my body’s valor,</p>

<p>In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,</p>

<p>That he is a traitor foul and dangerous</p>

<p>To God of heaven, King Richard, and to me.</p>

<p>And as I truly fight, defend me heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marshal</sc></p>

<p>On pain of death, no person be so bold</p>

<p>Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,</p>

<p>Except the Marshal and such officers</p>

<p>Appointed to direct these fair designs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Lord Marshal, let me kiss my sovereign’s hand</p>

<p>And bow my knee before his Majesty;</p>

<p>For Mowbray and myself are like two men</p>

<p>That vow a long and weary pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Then let us take a ceremonious leave</p>

<p>And loving farewell of our several friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marshal</sc> <i>[to King Richard]</i></p>

<p>The appellant in all duty greets your Highness</p>

<p>And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc> <i>[coming down]</i></p>

<p>We will descend and fold him in our arms.</p>

<p><center><i>[He embraces Bolingbroke.]</i></center></p>

<p>Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,</p>

<p>So be thy fortune in this royal fight.</p>

<p>Farewell, my blood–which, if today thou shed,</p>

<p>Lament we may but not revenge thee dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>O, let no noble eye profane a tear</p>

<p>For me if I be gored with Mowbray’s spear.</p>

<p>As confident as is the falcon’s flight</p>

<p>Against a bird do I with Mowbray fight.</p>

<p>My loving lord, I take my leave of you.–</p>

<p>Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;</p>

<p>Not sick, although I have to do with death,</p>

<p>But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.–</p>

<p>Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet</p>

<p>The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet.</p>

<p>O, thou the earthly author of my blood,</p>

<p>Whose youthful spirit in me regenerate</p>

<p>Doth with a twofold vigor lift me up</p>

<p>To reach at victory above my head,</p>

<p>Add proof unto mine armor with thy prayers,</p>

<p>And with thy blessings steel my lance’s point</p>

<p>That it may enter Mowbray’s waxen coat</p>

<p>And furbish new the name of John o’ Gaunt,</p>

<p>Even in the lusty havior of his son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>God in thy good cause make thee prosperous.</p>

<p>Be swift like lightning in the execution,</p>

<p>And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,</p>

<p>Fall like amazing thunder on the casque</p>

<p>Of thy adverse pernicious enemy.</p>

<p>Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant, and live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Mine innocence and Saint George to thrive!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mowbray</sc></p>

<p>However God or fortune cast my lot,</p>

<p>There lives or dies, true to King Richard’s throne,</p>

<p>A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.</p>

<p>Never did captive with a freer heart</p>

<p>Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace</p>

<p>His golden uncontrolled enfranchisement</p>

<p>More than my dancing soul doth celebrate</p>

<p>This feast of battle with mine adversary.</p>

<p>Most mighty liege and my companion peers,</p>

<p>Take from my mouth the wish of happy years.</p>

<p>As gentle and as jocund as to jest</p>

<p>Go I to fight. Truth hath a quiet breast.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, my lord. Securely I espy</p>

<p>Virtue with valor couched in thine eye.–</p>

<p>Order the trial, marshal, and begin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marshal</sc></p>

<p>Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,</p>

<p>Receive thy lance; and God defend the right.</p>

<p><center><i>[He presents a lance to Bolingbroke.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Strong as a tower in hope, I cry “Amen!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marshal</sc> <i>[to an Officer]</i></p>

<p>Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.</p>

<p><center><i>[An Officer presents a lance to Mowbray.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Herald</sc></p>

<p>Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby</p>

<p>Stands here for God, his sovereign, and himself,</p>

<p>On pain to be found false and recreant,</p>

<p>To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,</p>

<p>A traitor to his God, his king, and him,</p>

<p>And dares him to set forward to the fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Herald</sc></p>

<p>Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,</p>

<p>On pain to be found false and recreant,</p>

<p>Both to defend himself and to approve</p>

<p>Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby</p>

<p>To God, his sovereign, and to him disloyal,</p>

<p>Courageously and with a free desire</p>

<p>Attending but the signal to begin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marshal</sc></p>

<p>Sound, trumpets, and set forward, combatants.</p>

<p><center><i>[Trumpets sound. Richard throws down his warder.]</i></center></p>

<p>Stay! The King hath thrown his warder down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,</p>

<p>And both return back to their chairs again.</p>

<p><i>[To his council.]</i> Withdraw with us, and let the</p>

<p>trumpets sound</p>

<p>While we return these dukes what we decree.</p>

<p><center><i>[Trumpets sound while Richard consults with Gaunt</p>

<p>and other Nobles.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Bolingbroke and Mowbray.]</i> Draw near,</p>

<p>And list what with our council we have done.</p>

<p>For that our kingdom’s earth should not be soiled</p>

<p>With that dear blood which it hath fostered;</p>

<p>And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect</p>

<p>Of civil wounds plowed up with neighbor’s sword;</p>

<p>And for we think the eagle-winged pride</p>

<p>Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,</p>

<p>With rival-hating envy, set on you</p>

<p>To wake our peace, which in our country’s cradle</p>

<p>Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep,</p>

<p>Which, so roused up with boist’rous untuned</p>

<p>drums,</p>

<p>With harsh resounding trumpets’ dreadful bray,</p>

<p>And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,</p>

<p>Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace</p>

<p>And make us wade even in our kindred’s blood:</p>

<p>Therefore we banish you our territories.</p>

<p>You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,</p>

<p>Till twice five summers have enriched our fields</p>

<p>Shall not regreet our fair dominions,</p>

<p>But tread the stranger paths of banishment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Your will be done. This must my comfort be:</p>

<p>That sun that warms you here shall shine on me,</p>

<p>And those his golden beams to you here lent</p>

<p>Shall point on me and gild my banishment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,</p>

<p>Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:</p>

<p>The sly, slow hours shall not determinate</p>

<p>The dateless limit of thy dear exile.</p>

<p>The hopeless word of “never to return”</p>

<p>Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mowbray</sc></p>

<p>A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,</p>

<p>And all unlooked-for from your Highness’ mouth.</p>

<p>A dearer merit, not so deep a maim</p>

<p>As to be cast forth in the common air,</p>

<p>Have I deserved at your Highness’ hands.</p>

<p>The language I have learnt these forty years,</p>

<p>My native English, now I must forgo;</p>

<p>And now my tongue’s use is to me no more</p>

<p>Than an unstringed viol or a harp,</p>

<p>Or like a cunning instrument cased up,</p>

<p>Or, being open, put into his hands</p>

<p>That knows no touch to tune the harmony.</p>

<p>Within my mouth you have enjailed my tongue,</p>

<p>Doubly portcullised with my teeth and lips,</p>

<p>And dull unfeeling barren ignorance</p>

<p>Is made my jailor to attend on me.</p>

<p>I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,</p>

<p>Too far in years to be a pupil now.</p>

<p>What is thy sentence then but speechless death,</p>

<p>Which robs my tongue from breathing native</p>

<p>breath?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>It boots thee not to be compassionate.</p>

<p>After our sentence plaining comes too late.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mowbray</sc></p>

<p>Then thus I turn me from my country’s light,</p>

<p>To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.</p>

<p><center><i>[He begins to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Return again, and take an oath with thee.</p>

<p><i>[To Mowbray and Bolingbroke.]</i> Lay on our royal</p>

<p>sword your banished hands.</p>

<p><center><i>[They place their right hands on the hilts of</p>

<p>Richard’s sword.]</i></center></p>

<p>Swear by the duty that you owe to God–</p>

<p>Our part therein we banish with yourselves–</p>

<p>To keep the oath that we administer:</p>

<p>You never shall, so help you truth and God,</p>

<p>Embrace each other’s love in banishment,</p>

<p>Nor never look upon each other’s face,</p>

<p>Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile</p>

<p>This louring tempest of your homebred hate,</p>

<p>Nor never by advised purpose meet</p>

<p>To plot, contrive, or complot any ill</p>

<p>’Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc>  I swear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mowbray</sc>  And I, to keep all this.</p>

<p><center><i>[They step back.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:</p>

<p>By this time, had the King permitted us,</p>

<p>One of our souls had wandered in the air,</p>

<p>Banished this frail sepulcher of our flesh,</p>

<p>As now our flesh is banished from this land.</p>

<p>Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm.</p>

<p>Since thou hast far to go, bear not along</p>

<p>The clogging burden of a guilty soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mowbray</sc></p>

<p>No, Bolingbroke; if ever I were traitor,</p>

<p>My name be blotted from the book of life,</p>

<p>And I from heaven banished as from hence.</p>

<p>But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know,</p>

<p>And all too soon, I fear, the King shall rue.–</p>

<p>Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;</p>

<p>Save back to England, all the world’s my way.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc> <i>[to Gaunt]</i></p>

<p>Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes</p>

<p>I see thy grieved heart. Thy sad aspect</p>

<p>Hath from the number of his banished years</p>

<p>Plucked four away. <i>[To Bolingbroke.]</i> Six frozen</p>

<p>winters spent,</p>

<p>Return with welcome home from banishment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>How long a time lies in one little word!</p>

<p>Four lagging winters and four wanton springs</p>

<p>End in a word; such is the breath of kings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>I thank my liege that in regard of me</p>

<p>He shortens four years of my son’s exile.</p>

<p>But little vantage shall I reap thereby;</p>

<p>For, ere the six years that he hath to spend</p>

<p>Can change their moons and bring their times</p>

<p>about,</p>

<p>My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light</p>

<p>Shall be extinct with age and endless night;</p>

<p>My inch of taper will be burnt and done,</p>

<p>And blindfold death not let me see my son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Why, uncle, thou hast many years to live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>But not a minute, king, that thou canst give.</p>

<p>Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,</p>

<p>And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow.</p>

<p>Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,</p>

<p>But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Thy word is current with him for my death,</p>

<p>But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Thy son is banished upon good advice,</p>

<p>Whereto thy tongue a party verdict gave.</p>

<p>Why at our justice seem’st thou then to lour?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.</p>

<p>You urged me as a judge, but I had rather</p>

<p>You would have bid me argue like a father.</p>

<p>O, had it been a stranger, not my child,</p>

<p>To smooth his fault I should have been more mild.</p>

<p>A partial slander sought I to avoid,</p>

<p>And in the sentence my own life destroyed.</p>

<p>Alas, I looked when some of you should say</p>

<p>I was too strict, to make mine own away.</p>

<p>But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue</p>

<p>Against my will to do myself this wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc> <i>[to Bolingbroke]</i></p>

<p>Cousin, farewell.–And, uncle, bid him so.</p>

<p>Six years we banish him, and he shall go.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. King Richard exits with his Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aumerle</sc> <i>[to Bolingbroke]</i></p>

<p>Cousin, farewell. What presence must not know,</p>

<p>From where you do remain let paper show.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marshal</sc> <i>[to Bolingbroke]</i></p>

<p>My lord, no leave take I, for I will ride,</p>

<p>As far as land will let me, by your side.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc> <i>[to Bolingbroke]</i></p>

<p>O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,</p>

<p>That thou returnest no greeting to thy friends?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>I have too few to take my leave of you,</p>

<p>When the tongue’s office should be prodigal</p>

<p>To breathe the abundant dolor of the heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Joy absent, grief is present for that time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>What is six winters? They are quickly gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>Call it a travel that thou tak’st for pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,</p>

<p>Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>The sullen passage of thy weary steps</p>

<p>Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set</p>

<p>The precious jewel of thy home return.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Nay, rather every tedious stride I make</p>

<p>Will but remember me what a deal of world</p>

<p>I wander from the jewels that I love.</p>

<p>Must I not serve a long apprenticehood</p>

<p>To foreign passages, and in the end,</p>

<p>Having my freedom, boast of nothing else</p>

<p>But that I was a journeyman to grief?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>All places that the eye of heaven visits</p>

<p>Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.</p>

<p>Teach thy necessity to reason thus:</p>

<p>There is no virtue like necessity.</p>

<p>Think not the King did banish thee,</p>

<p>But thou the King. Woe doth the heavier sit</p>

<p>Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.</p>

<p>Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honor,</p>

<p>And not the King exiled thee; or suppose</p>

<p>Devouring pestilence hangs in our air</p>

<p>And thou art flying to a fresher clime.</p>

<p>Look what thy soul holds dear, imagine it</p>

<p>To lie that way thou goest, not whence thou com’st.</p>

<p>Suppose the singing birds musicians,</p>

<p>The grass whereon thou tread’st the presence</p>

<p>strewed,</p>

<p>The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more</p>

<p>Than a delightful measure or a dance;</p>

<p>For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite</p>

<p>The man that mocks at it and sets it light.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>O, who can hold a fire in his hand</p>

<p>By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?</p>

<p>Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite</p>

<p>By bare imagination of a feast?</p>

<p>Or wallow naked in December snow</p>

<p>By thinking on fantastic summer’s heat?</p>

<p>O no, the apprehension of the good</p>

<p>Gives but the greater feeling to the worse.</p>

<p>Fell sorrow’s tooth doth never rankle more</p>

<p>Than when he bites but lanceth not the sore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>Come, come, my son, I’ll bring thee on thy way.</p>

<p>Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bolingbroke</sc></p>

<p>Then, England’s ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu,</p>

<p>My mother and my nurse that bears me yet.</p>

<p>Where’er I wander, boast of this I can,</p>

<p>Though banished, yet a trueborn Englishman.</p>
