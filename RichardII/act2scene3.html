<p><center><i>[Enter Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford, and</p>

<p>Northumberland.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  Believe me, noble lord,</p>

<p>I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire.</p>

<p>These high wild hills and rough uneven ways</p>

<p>Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome.</p>

<p>And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,</p>

<p>Making the hard way sweet and delectable.</p>

<p>But I bethink me what a weary way</p>

<p>From Ravenspurgh to Cotshall will be found</p>

<p>In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,</p>

<p>Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled</p>

<p>The tediousness and process of my travel.</p>

<p>But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have</p>

<p>The present benefit which I possess,</p>

<p>And hope to joy is little less in joy</p>

<p>Than hope enjoyed. By this the weary lords</p>

<p>Shall make their way seem short as mine hath done</p>

<p>By sight of what I have, your noble company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>Of much less value is my company</p>

<p>Than your good words. But who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Harry Percy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  It is my son, young Harry Percy,</p>

<p>Sent from my brother Worcester whencesoever.–</p>

<p>Harry, how fares your uncle?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Percy</span></p>

<p>I had thought, my lord, to have learned his health of</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>  Why, is he not with the Queen?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Percy</span></p>

<p>No, my good lord, he hath forsook the court,</p>

<p>Broken his staff of office, and dispersed</p>

<p>The Household of the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>What was his reason? He was not so resolved</p>

<p>When last we spake together.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Percy</span></p>

<p>Because your Lordship was proclaimed traitor.</p>

<p>But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh</p>

<p>To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,</p>

<p>And sent me over by Berkeley to discover</p>

<p>What power the Duke of York had levied there,</p>

<p>Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Percy</span></p>

<p>No, my good lord, for that is not forgot</p>

<p>Which ne’er I did remember. To my knowledge</p>

<p>I never in my life did look on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Then learn to know him now. This is the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Percy</span> <i>[to Bolingbroke]</i></p>

<p>My gracious lord, I tender you my service,</p>

<p>Such as it is, being tender, raw, and young,</p>

<p>Which elder days shall ripen and confirm</p>

<p>To more approved service and desert.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>I thank thee, gentle Percy, and be sure</p>

<p>I count myself in nothing else so happy</p>

<p>As in a soul rememb’ring my good friends;</p>

<p>And as my fortune ripens with thy love,</p>

<p>It shall be still thy true love’s recompense.</p>

<p>My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gives Percy his hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span> <i>[to Percy]</i></p>

<p>How far is it to Berkeley, and what stir</p>

<p>Keeps good old York there with his men of war?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Percy</span></p>

<p>There stands the castle by yon tuft of trees,</p>

<p>Manned with three hundred men, as I have heard,</p>

<p>And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and</p>

<p>Seymour,</p>

<p>None else of name and noble estimate.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ross and Willoughby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,</p>

<p>Bloody with spurring, fiery red with haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues</p>

<p>A banished traitor. All my treasury</p>

<p>Is yet but unfelt thanks, which, more enriched,</p>

<p>Shall be your love and labor’s recompense.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span></p>

<p>Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Willoughby</span></p>

<p>And far surmounts our labor to attain it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>Evermore thank’s the exchequer of the poor,</p>

<p>Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,</p>

<p>Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Berkeley.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berkeley</span> <i>[to Bolingbroke]</i></p>

<p>My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>My lord, my answer is–to “Lancaster”;</p>

<p>And I am come to seek that name in England.</p>

<p>And I must find that title in your tongue</p>

<p>Before I make reply to aught you say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berkeley</span></p>

<p>Mistake me not, my lord, ’tis not my meaning</p>

<p>To rase one title of your honor out.</p>

<p>To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,</p>

<p>From the most gracious regent of this land,</p>

<p>The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on</p>

<p>To take advantage of the absent time,</p>

<p>And fright our native peace with self-borne arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter York.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>I shall not need transport my words by you.</p>

<p>Here comes his Grace in person.     <i><i>[He kneels.]</i></i></p>

<p>My noble uncle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Show me thy humble heart and not thy knee,</p>

<p>Whose duty is deceivable and false.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span> <i>[standing]</i>  My gracious uncle–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  Tut, tut!</p>

<p>Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle.</p>

<p>I am no traitor’s uncle, and that word “grace”</p>

<p>In an ungracious mouth is but profane.</p>

<p>Why have those banished and forbidden legs</p>

<p>Dared once to touch a dust of England’s ground?</p>

<p>But then, more why: why have they dared to march</p>

<p>So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,</p>

<p>Frighting her pale-faced villages with war</p>

<p>And ostentation of despised arms?</p>

<p>Com’st thou because the anointed king is hence?</p>

<p>Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind</p>

<p>And in my loyal bosom lies his power.</p>

<p>Were I but now lord of such hot youth</p>

<p>As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself</p>

<p>Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,</p>

<p>From forth the ranks of many thousand French,</p>

<p>O, then, how quickly should this arm of mine,</p>

<p>Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee</p>

<p>And minister correction to thy fault!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>My gracious uncle, let me know my fault.</p>

<p>On what condition stands it and wherein?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Even in condition of the worst degree,</p>

<p>In gross rebellion and detested treason.</p>

<p>Thou art a banished man and here art come,</p>

<p>Before the expiration of thy time,</p>

<p>In braving arms against thy sovereign.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>As I was banished, I was banished Hereford,</p>

<p>But as I come, I come for Lancaster.</p>

<p>And, noble uncle, I beseech your Grace</p>

<p>Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye.</p>

<p>You are my father, for methinks in you</p>

<p>I see old Gaunt alive. O, then, my father,</p>

<p>Will you permit that I shall stand condemned</p>

<p>A wandering vagabond, my rights and royalties</p>

<p>Plucked from my arms perforce and given away</p>

<p>To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?</p>

<p>If that my cousin king be king in England,</p>

<p>It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.</p>

<p>You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin.</p>

<p>Had you first died and he been thus trod down,</p>

<p>He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father</p>

<p>To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.</p>

<p>I am denied to sue my livery here,</p>

<p>And yet my letters patents give me leave.</p>

<p>My father’s goods are all distrained and sold,</p>

<p>And these, and all, are all amiss employed.</p>

<p>What would you have me do? I am a subject,</p>

<p>And I challenge law. Attorneys are denied me,</p>

<p>And therefore personally I lay my claim</p>

<p>To my inheritance of free descent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span> <i>[to York]</i></p>

<p>The noble duke hath been too much abused.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span> <i>[to York]</i></p>

<p>It stands your Grace upon to do him right.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Willoughby</span> <i>[to York]</i></p>

<p>Base men by his endowments are made great.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>My lords of England, let me tell you this:</p>

<p>I have had feeling of my cousin’s wrongs</p>

<p>And labored all I could to do him right.</p>

<p>But in this kind to come, in braving arms,</p>

<p>Be his own carver and cut out his way</p>

<p>To find out right with wrong, it may not be.</p>

<p>And you that do abet him in this kind</p>

<p>Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Northumberland</span></p>

<p>The noble duke hath sworn his coming is</p>

<p>But for his own, and for the right of that</p>

<p>We all have strongly sworn to give him aid.</p>

<p>And let him never see joy that breaks that oath.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Well, well. I see the issue of these arms.</p>

<p>I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,</p>

<p>Because my power is weak and all ill-left.</p>

<p>But if I could, by Him that gave me life,</p>

<p>I would attach you all and make you stoop</p>

<p>Unto the sovereign mercy of the King.</p>

<p>But since I cannot, be it known unto you</p>

<p>I do remain as neuter. So fare you well–</p>

<p>Unless you please to enter in the castle</p>

<p>And there repose you for this night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>An offer, uncle, that we will accept.</p>

<p>But we must win your Grace to go with us</p>

<p>To Bristow Castle, which they say is held</p>

<p>By Bushy, Bagot, and their complices,</p>

<p>The caterpillars of the commonwealth,</p>

<p>Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>It may be I will go with you; but yet I’ll pause,</p>

<p>For I am loath to break our country’s laws.</p>

<p>Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are.</p>

<p>Things past redress are now with me past care.</p>
