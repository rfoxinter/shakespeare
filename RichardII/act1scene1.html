<p><center><i>[Enter King Richard, John of Gaunt, with other Nobles</p>

<p>and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Old John of Gaunt, time-honored Lancaster,</p>

<p>Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</p>

<p>Brought hither Henry Hereford, thy bold son,</p>

<p>Here to make good the boist’rous late appeal,</p>

<p>Which then our leisure would not let us hear,</p>

<p>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gaunt</span>  I have, my liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him</p>

<p>If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice</p>

<p>Or worthily, as a good subject should,</p>

<p>On some known ground of treachery in him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gaunt</span></p>

<p>As near as I could sift him on that argument,</p>

<p>On some apparent danger seen in him</p>

<p>Aimed at your Highness, no inveterate malice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Then call them to our presence.</p>

<p><center><i>[An Attendant exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Face to face</p>

<p>And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear</p>

<p>The accuser and the accused freely speak.</p>

<p>High stomached are they both and full of ire,</p>

<p>In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bolingbroke and Mowbray.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>Many years of happy days befall</p>

<p>My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>Each day still better other’s happiness</p>

<p>Until the heavens, envying earth’s good hap,</p>

<p>Add an immortal title to your crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>We thank you both. Yet one but flatters us,</p>

<p>As well appeareth by the cause you come:</p>

<p>Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.</p>

<p>Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object</p>

<p>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>First–heaven be the record to my speech!–</p>

<p>In the devotion of a subject’s love,</p>

<p>Tend’ring the precious safety of my prince</p>

<p>And free from other misbegotten hate,</p>

<p>Come I appellant to this princely presence.–</p>

<p>Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee;</p>

<p>And mark my greeting well, for what I speak</p>

<p>My body shall make good upon this earth</p>

<p>Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</p>

<p>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</p>

<p>Too good to be so and too bad to live,</p>

<p>Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</p>

<p>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</p>

<p>Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</p>

<p>With a foul traitor’s name stuff I thy throat,</p>

<p>And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,</p>

<p>What my tongue speaks my right-drawn sword may</p>

<p>prove.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.</p>

<p>’Tis not the trial of a woman’s war,</p>

<p>The bitter clamor of two eager tongues,</p>

<p>Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain.</p>

<p>The blood is hot that must be cooled for this.</p>

<p>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</p>

<p>As to be hushed and naught at all to say.</p>

<p>First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me</p>

<p>From giving reins and spurs to my free speech,</p>

<p>Which else would post until it had returned</p>

<p>These terms of treason doubled down his throat.</p>

<p>Setting aside his high blood’s royalty,</p>

<p>And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</p>

<p>I do defy him, and I spit at him,</p>

<p>Call him a slanderous coward and a villain,</p>

<p>Which to maintain I would allow him odds</p>

<p>And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</p>

<p>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps</p>

<p>Or any other ground inhabitable</p>

<p>Wherever Englishman durst set his foot.</p>

<p>Meantime let this defend my loyalty:</p>

<p>By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span> <i>[throwing down a gage]</i></p>

<p>Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,</p>

<p>Disclaiming here the kindred of the King,</p>

<p>And lay aside my high blood’s royalty,</p>

<p>Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.</p>

<p>If guilty dread have left thee so much strength</p>

<p>As to take up mine honor’s pawn, then stoop.</p>

<p>By that and all the rites of knighthood else</p>

<p>Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,</p>

<p>What I have spoke or thou canst worse devise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span> <i>[picking up the gage]</i></p>

<p>I take it up, and by that sword I swear</p>

<p>Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,</p>

<p>I’ll answer thee in any fair degree</p>

<p>Or chivalrous design of knightly trial;</p>

<p>And when I mount, alive may I not light</p>

<p>If I be traitor or unjustly fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray’s charge?</p>

<p>It must be great that can inherit us</p>

<p>So much as of a thought of ill in him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true:</p>

<p>That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles</p>

<p>In name of lendings for your Highness’ soldiers,</p>

<p>The which he hath detained for lewd employments,</p>

<p>Like a false traitor and injurious villain.</p>

<p>Besides I say, and will in battle prove,</p>

<p>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</p>

<p>That ever was surveyed by English eye,</p>

<p>That all the treasons for these eighteen years</p>

<p>Complotted and contrived in this land</p>

<p>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and</p>

<p>spring.</p>

<p>Further I say, and further will maintain</p>

<p>Upon his bad life to make all this good,</p>

<p>That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester’s death,</p>

<p>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</p>

<p>And consequently, like a traitor coward,</p>

<p>Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of</p>

<p>blood,</p>

<p>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel’s, cries</p>

<p>Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth</p>

<p>To me for justice and rough chastisement.</p>

<p>And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</p>

<p>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>How high a pitch his resolution soars!–</p>

<p>Thomas of Norfolk, what sayst thou to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>O, let my sovereign turn away his face</p>

<p>And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</p>

<p>Till I have told this slander of his blood</p>

<p>How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears.</p>

<p>Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom’s heir,</p>

<p>As he is but my father’s brother’s son,</p>

<p>Now by my scepter’s awe I make a vow:</p>

<p>Such neighbor nearness to our sacred blood</p>

<p>Should nothing privilege him nor partialize</p>

<p>The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.</p>

<p>He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou.</p>

<p>Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,</p>

<p>Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.</p>

<p>Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais</p>

<p>Disbursed I duly to his Highness’ soldiers;</p>

<p>The other part reserved I by consent,</p>

<p>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt</p>

<p>Upon remainder of a dear account</p>

<p>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen.</p>

<p>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester’s death,</p>

<p>I slew him not, but to my own disgrace</p>

<p>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.–</p>

<p>For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</p>

<p>The honorable father to my foe,</p>

<p>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</p>

<p>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul.</p>

<p>But ere I last received the sacrament,</p>

<p>I did confess it and exactly begged</p>

<p>Your Grace’s pardon, and I hope I had it.–</p>

<p>This is my fault. As for the rest appealed,</p>

<p>It issues from the rancor of a villain,</p>

<p>A recreant and most degenerate traitor,</p>

<p>Which in myself I boldly will defend,</p>

<p>And interchangeably hurl down my gage</p>

<p>Upon this overweening traitor’s foot,</p>

<p><center><i>[He throws down a gage.]</i></center></p>

<p>To prove myself a loyal gentleman,</p>

<p>Even in the best blood chambered in his bosom;</p>

<p>In haste whereof most heartily I pray</p>

<p>Your Highness to assign our trial day.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bolingbroke picks up the gage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me.</p>

<p>Let’s purge this choler without letting blood.</p>

<p>This we prescribe, though no physician.</p>

<p>Deep malice makes too deep incision.</p>

<p>Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed.</p>

<p>Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.–</p>

<p>Good uncle, let this end where it begun;</p>

<p>We’ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gaunt</span></p>

<p>To be a make-peace shall become my age.–</p>

<p>Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk’s gage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>And, Norfolk, throw down his.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gaunt</span>  When, Harry, when?</p>

<p>Obedience bids I should not bid again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span></p>

<p>Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.</p>

<p><center><i>[Mowbray kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>My life thou shalt command, but not my shame.</p>

<p>The one my duty owes, but my fair name,</p>

<p>Despite of death that lives upon my grave,</p>

<p>To dark dishonor’s use thou shalt not have.</p>

<p>I am disgraced, impeached, and baffled here,</p>

<p>Pierced to the soul with slander’s venomed spear,</p>

<p>The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood</p>

<p>Which breathed this poison.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Rage must be withstood.</p>

<p>Give me his gage. Lions make leopards tame.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mowbray</span> <i>[standing]</i></p>

<p>Yea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame</p>

<p>And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,</p>

<p>The purest treasure mortal times afford</p>

<p>Is spotless reputation; that away,</p>

<p>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.</p>

<p>A jewel in a ten-times-barred-up chest</p>

<p>Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.</p>

<p>Mine honor is my life; both grow in one.</p>

<p>Take honor from me and my life is done.</p>

<p>Then, dear my liege, mine honor let me try.</p>

<p>In that I live, and for that will I die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[to Bolingbroke]</i></p>

<p>Cousin, throw up your gage. Do you begin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!</p>

<p>Shall I seem crestfallen in my father’s sight?</p>

<p>Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height</p>

<p>Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue</p>

<p>Shall wound my honor with such feeble wrong</p>

<p>Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear</p>

<p>The slavish motive of recanting fear</p>

<p>And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,</p>

<p>Where shame doth harbor, even in Mowbray’s face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>We were not born to sue, but to command,</p>

<p>Which, since we cannot do, to make you friends,</p>

<p>Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,</p>

<p>At Coventry upon Saint Lambert’s day.</p>

<p>There shall your swords and lances arbitrate</p>

<p>The swelling difference of your settled hate.</p>

<p>Since we cannot atone you, we shall see</p>

<p>Justice design the victor’s chivalry.–</p>

<p>Lord Marshal, command our officers-at-arms</p>

<p>Be ready to direct these home alarms.</p>
