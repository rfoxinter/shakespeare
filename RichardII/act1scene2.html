<p><center><i>[Enter John of Gaunt with the Duchess of Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>Alas, the part I had in Woodstock’s blood</p>

<p>Doth more solicit me than your exclaims</p>

<p>To stir against the butchers of his life.</p>

<p>But since correction lieth in those hands</p>

<p>Which made the fault that we cannot correct,</p>

<p>Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven,</p>

<p>Who, when they see the hours ripe on Earth,</p>

<p>Will rain hot vengeance on offenders’ heads.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?</p>

<p>Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?</p>

<p>Edward’s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,</p>

<p>Were as seven vials of his sacred blood</p>

<p>Or seven fair branches springing from one root.</p>

<p>Some of those seven are dried by nature’s course,</p>

<p>Some of those branches by the Destinies cut.</p>

<p>But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,</p>

<p>One vial full of Edward’s sacred blood,</p>

<p>One flourishing branch of his most royal root,</p>

<p>Is cracked and all the precious liquor spilt,</p>

<p>Is hacked down, and his summer leaves all faded,</p>

<p>By envy’s hand and murder’s bloody ax.</p>

<p>Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! That bed, that</p>

<p>womb,</p>

<p>That metal, that self mold that fashioned thee</p>

<p>Made him a man; and though thou livest and</p>

<p>breathest,</p>

<p>Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent</p>

<p>In some large measure to thy father’s death</p>

<p>In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,</p>

<p>Who was the model of thy father’s life.</p>

<p>Call it not patience, Gaunt. It is despair.</p>

<p>In suff’ring thus thy brother to be slaughtered,</p>

<p>Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,</p>

<p>Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.</p>

<p>That which in mean men we entitle patience</p>

<p>Is pale, cold cowardice in noble breasts.</p>

<p>What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life,</p>

<p>The best way is to venge my Gloucester’s death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>God’s is the quarrel; for God’s substitute,</p>

<p>His deputy anointed in His sight,</p>

<p>Hath caused his death, the which if wrongfully</p>

<p>Let heaven revenge, for I may never lift</p>

<p>An angry arm against His minister.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Where, then, alas, may I complain myself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>To God, the widow’s champion and defense.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Why then I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.</p>

<p>Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold</p>

<p>Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight.</p>

<p>O, sit my husband’s wrongs on Hereford’s spear,</p>

<p>That it may enter butcher Mowbray’s breast!</p>

<p>Or if misfortune miss the first career,</p>

<p>Be Mowbray’s sins so heavy in his bosom</p>

<p>That they may break his foaming courser’s back</p>

<p>And throw the rider headlong in the lists,</p>

<p>A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!</p>

<p>Farewell, old Gaunt. Thy sometime brother’s wife</p>

<p>With her companion, grief, must end her life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gaunt</sc></p>

<p>Sister, farewell. I must to Coventry.</p>

<p>As much good stay with thee as go with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Yet one word more. Grief boundeth where it falls,</p>

<p>Not with the empty hollowness, but weight.</p>

<p>I take my leave before I have begun,</p>

<p>For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.</p>

<p>Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.</p>

<p>Lo, this is all. Nay, yet depart not so!</p>

<p>Though this be all, do not so quickly go;</p>

<p>I shall remember more. Bid him–ah, what?–</p>

<p>With all good speed at Plashy visit me.</p>

<p>Alack, and what shall good old York there see</p>

<p>But empty lodgings and unfurnished walls,</p>

<p>Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?</p>

<p>And what hear there for welcome but my groans?</p>

<p>Therefore commend me; let him not come there</p>

<p>To seek out sorrow that dwells everywhere.</p>

<p>Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die.</p>

<p>The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.</p>
