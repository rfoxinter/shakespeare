<p><center><i>[Enter Richard alone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>I have been studying how I may compare</p>

<p>This prison where I live unto the world,</p>

<p>And for because the world is populous</p>

<p>And here is not a creature but myself,</p>

<p>I cannot do it. Yet I’ll hammer it out.</p>

<p>My brain I’ll prove the female to my soul,</p>

<p>My soul the father, and these two beget</p>

<p>A generation of still-breeding thoughts,</p>

<p>And these same thoughts people this little world,</p>

<p>In humors like the people of this world,</p>

<p>For no thought is contented. The better sort,</p>

<p>As thoughts of things divine, are intermixed</p>

<p>With scruples, and do set the word itself</p>

<p>Against the word, as thus: “Come, little ones,”</p>

<p>And then again,</p>

<p>“It is as hard to come as for a camel</p>

<p>To thread the postern of a small needle’s eye.”</p>

<p>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</p>

<p>Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails</p>

<p>May tear a passage through the flinty ribs</p>

<p>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,</p>

<p>And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.</p>

<p>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</p>

<p>That they are not the first of fortune’s slaves,</p>

<p>Nor shall not be the last–like silly beggars</p>

<p>Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame</p>

<p>That many have and others must sit there,</p>

<p>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</p>

<p>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</p>

<p>Of such as have before endured the like.</p>

<p>Thus play I in one person many people,</p>

<p>And none contented. Sometimes am I king.</p>

<p>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</p>

<p>And so I am; then crushing penury</p>

<p>Persuades me I was better when a king.</p>

<p>Then am I kinged again, and by and by</p>

<p>Think that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke,</p>

<p>And straight am nothing. But whate’er I be,</p>

<p>Nor I nor any man that but man is</p>

<p>With nothing shall be pleased till he be eased</p>

<p>With being nothing. <i>[(The music plays.)]</i> Music do I</p>

<p>hear?</p>

<p>Ha, ha, keep time! How sour sweet music is</p>

<p>When time is broke and no proportion kept.</p>

<p>So is it in the music of men’s lives.</p>

<p>And here have I the daintiness of ear</p>

<p>To check time broke in a disordered string;</p>

<p>But for the concord of my state and time</p>

<p>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</p>

<p>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</p>

<p>For now hath time made me his numb’ring clock.</p>

<p>My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar</p>

<p>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</p>

<p>Whereto my finger, like a dial’s point,</p>

<p>Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears.</p>

<p>Now, sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</p>

<p>Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart,</p>

<p>Which is the bell. So sighs and tears and groans</p>

<p>Show minutes, times, and hours. But my time</p>

<p>Runs posting on in Bolingbroke’s proud joy,</p>

<p>While I stand fooling here, his jack of the clock.</p>

<p>This music mads me. Let it sound no more,</p>

<p>For though it have holp madmen to their wits,</p>

<p>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</p>

<p>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me,</p>

<p>For ’tis a sign of love, and love to Richard</p>

<p>Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Groom of the stable.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Groom</span>  Hail, royal prince!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  Thanks, noble peer.</p>

<p>The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.</p>

<p>What art thou, and how comest thou hither,</p>

<p>Where no man never comes but that sad dog</p>

<p>That brings me food to make misfortune live?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Groom</span></p>

<p>I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,</p>

<p>When thou wert king; who, traveling towards York,</p>

<p>With much ado at length have gotten leave</p>

<p>To look upon my sometime royal master’s face.</p>

<p>O, how it earned my heart when I beheld</p>

<p>In London streets, that coronation day,</p>

<p>When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,</p>

<p>That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,</p>

<p>That horse that I so carefully have dressed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,</p>

<p>How went he under him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Groom</span></p>

<p>So proudly as if he disdained the ground.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!</p>

<p>That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;</p>

<p>This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.</p>

<p>Would he not stumble? Would he not fall down</p>

<p>(Since pride must have a fall) and break the neck</p>

<p>Of that proud man that did usurp his back?</p>

<p>Forgiveness, horse! Why do I rail on thee,</p>

<p>Since thou, created to be awed by man,</p>

<p>Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse,</p>

<p>And yet I bear a burden like an ass,</p>

<p>Spurred, galled, and tired by jauncing Bolingbroke.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter one, the Keeper, to Richard with meat.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span> <i>[to Groom]</i></p>

<p>Fellow, give place. Here is no longer stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[to Groom]</i></p>

<p>If thou love me, ’tis time thou wert away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Groom</span></p>

<p>What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.</p>

<p><center><i>[Groom exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span>  My lord, will ’t please you to fall to?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Taste of it first as thou art wont to do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span></p>

<p>My lord, I dare not. Sir Pierce of Exton,</p>

<p>Who lately came from the King, commands the</p>

<p>contrary.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span> <i>[attacking the Keeper]</i></p>

<p>The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!</p>

<p>Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span>  Help, help, help!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The Murderers Exton and his men rush in.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>How now, what means death in this rude assault?</p>

<p>Villain, thy own hand yields thy death’s instrument.</p>

<p><center><i>[Richard seizes a weapon from a Murderer</p>

<p>and kills him with it.]</i></center></p>

<p>Go thou and fill another room in hell.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kills another Murderer.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Here Exton strikes him down.]</i></center></p>

<p>That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire</p>

<p>That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand</p>

<p>Hath with the King’s blood stained the King’s own</p>

<p>land.</p>

<p>Mount, mount, my soul. Thy seat is up on high,</p>

<p>Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.</p>

<p><center><i>[He dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exton</span></p>

<p>As full of valor as of royal blood.</p>

<p>Both have I spilled. O, would the deed were good!</p>

<p>For now the devil that told me I did well</p>

<p>Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.</p>

<p>This dead king to the living king I’ll bear.</p>

<p>Take hence the rest and give them burial here.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit with the bodies.]</i></center></p>
