<p><center><i>[Enter Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford, York,</p>

<p>Northumberland, with other Lords, and Bushy and</p>

<p>Green prisoners.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span>  Bring forth these men.–</p>

<p>Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls,</p>

<p>Since presently your souls must part your bodies,</p>

<p>With too much urging your pernicious lives,</p>

<p>For ’twere no charity; yet to wash your blood</p>

<p>From off my hands, here in the view of men</p>

<p>I will unfold some causes of your deaths:</p>

<p>You have misled a prince, a royal king,</p>

<p>A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments</p>

<p>By you unhappied and disfigured clean.</p>

<p>You have in manner with your sinful hours</p>

<p>Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,</p>

<p>Broke the possession of a royal bed,</p>

<p>And stained the beauty of a fair queen’s cheeks</p>

<p>With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.</p>

<p>Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,</p>

<p>Near to the King in blood, and near in love</p>

<p>Till you did make him misinterpret me,</p>

<p>Have stooped my neck under your injuries</p>

<p>And sighed my English breath in foreign clouds,</p>

<p>Eating the bitter bread of banishment,</p>

<p>Whilst you have fed upon my seigniories,</p>

<p>Disparked my parks and felled my forest woods,</p>

<p>From my own windows torn my household coat,</p>

<p>Rased out my imprese, leaving me no sign,</p>

<p>Save men’s opinions and my living blood,</p>

<p>To show the world I am a gentleman.</p>

<p>This and much more, much more than twice all</p>

<p>this,</p>

<p>Condemns you to the death.–See them delivered</p>

<p>over</p>

<p>To execution and the hand of death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bushy</span></p>

<p>More welcome is the stroke of death to me</p>

<p>Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Green</span></p>

<p>My comfort is that heaven will take our souls</p>

<p>And plague injustice with the pains of hell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatched.     <i><i>[Northumberland exits with Bushy and Green.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[To York.]</i> Uncle, you say the Queen is at your</p>

<p>house.</p>

<p>For God’s sake, fairly let her be entreated.</p>

<p>Tell her I send to her my kind commends.</p>

<p>Take special care my greetings be delivered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>A gentleman of mine I have dispatched</p>

<p>With letters of your love to her at large.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>Thanks, gentle uncle.–Come, lords, away,</p>

<p>To fight with Glendower and his complices.</p>

<p>A while to work, and after holiday.</p>
