<p><center><i>[Enter the Queen, Bushy, and Bagot.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bushy</span></p>

<p>Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.</p>

<p>You promised, when you parted with the King,</p>

<p>To lay aside life-harming heaviness</p>

<p>And entertain a cheerful disposition.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>To please the King I did; to please myself</p>

<p>I cannot do it. Yet I know no cause</p>

<p>Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,</p>

<p>Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest</p>

<p>As my sweet Richard. Yet again methinks</p>

<p>Some unborn sorrow ripe in Fortune’s womb</p>

<p>Is coming towards me, and my inward soul</p>

<p>With nothing trembles. At some thing it grieves</p>

<p>More than with parting from my lord the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bushy</span></p>

<p>Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows</p>

<p>Which shows like grief itself but is not so;</p>

<p>For sorrow’s eyes, glazed with blinding tears,</p>

<p>Divides one thing entire to many objects,</p>

<p>Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon</p>

<p>Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry</p>

<p>Distinguish form. So your sweet Majesty,</p>

<p>Looking awry upon your lord’s departure,</p>

<p>Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail,</p>

<p>Which, looked on as it is, is naught but shadows</p>

<p>Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,</p>

<p>More than your lord’s departure weep not. More is</p>

<p>not seen,</p>

<p>Or if it be, ’tis with false sorrow’s eye,</p>

<p>Which for things true weeps things imaginary.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>It may be so, but yet my inward soul</p>

<p>Persuades me it is otherwise. Howe’er it be,</p>

<p>I cannot but be sad–so heavy sad</p>

<p>As thought, on thinking on no thought I think,</p>

<p>Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bushy</span></p>

<p>’Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>’Tis nothing less. Conceit is still derived</p>

<p>From some forefather grief. Mine is not so,</p>

<p>For nothing hath begot my something grief–</p>

<p>Or something hath the nothing that I grieve.</p>

<p>’Tis in reversion that I do possess,</p>

<p>But what it is that is not yet known what,</p>

<p>I cannot name. ’Tis nameless woe, I wot.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Green.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Green</span></p>

<p>God save your Majesty!–And well met, gentlemen.</p>

<p>I hope the King is not yet shipped for Ireland.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>Why hopest thou so? ’Tis better hope he is,</p>

<p>For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope.</p>

<p>Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipped?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Green</span></p>

<p>That he, our hope, might have retired his power</p>

<p>And driven into despair an enemy’s hope,</p>

<p>Who strongly hath set footing in this land.</p>

<p>The banished Bolingbroke repeals himself</p>

<p>And with uplifted arms is safe arrived</p>

<p>At Ravenspurgh.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span>  Now God in heaven forbid!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Green</span></p>

<p>Ah, madam, ’tis too true. And that is worse,</p>

<p>The Lord Northumberland, his son young Harry</p>

<p>Percy,</p>

<p>The Lords of Ross, Beaumont, and Willoughby,</p>

<p>With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bushy</span></p>

<p>Why have you not proclaimed Northumberland</p>

<p>And all the rest revolted faction traitors?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Green</span></p>

<p>We have; whereupon the Earl of Worcester</p>

<p>Hath broken his staff, resigned his stewardship,</p>

<p>And all the Household servants fled with him</p>

<p>To Bolingbroke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,</p>

<p>And Bolingbroke my sorrow’s dismal heir.</p>

<p>Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,</p>

<p>And I, a gasping new-delivered mother,</p>

<p>Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow joined.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bushy</span></p>

<p>Despair not, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span>  Who shall hinder me?</p>

<p>I will despair and be at enmity</p>

<p>With cozening hope. He is a flatterer,</p>

<p>A parasite, a keeper-back of death,</p>

<p>Who gently would dissolve the bands of life</p>

<p>Which false hope lingers in extremity.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter York.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Green</span>  Here comes the Duke of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>With signs of war about his aged neck.</p>

<p>O, full of careful business are his looks!–</p>

<p>Uncle, for God’s sake speak comfortable words.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts.</p>

<p>Comfort’s in heaven, and we are on the Earth,</p>

<p>Where nothing lives but crosses, cares, and grief.</p>

<p>Your husband, he is gone to save far off</p>

<p>Whilst others come to make him lose at home.</p>

<p>Here am I left to underprop his land,</p>

<p>Who, weak with age, cannot support myself.</p>

<p>Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;</p>

<p>Now shall he try his friends that flattered him.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span></p>

<p>My lord, your son was gone before I came.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>He was? Why, so go all which way it will.</p>

<p>The nobles they are fled; the commons they are</p>

<p>cold</p>

<p>And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford’s side.</p>

<p>Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;</p>

<p>Bid her send me presently a thousand pound.</p>

<p>Hold, take my ring.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span></p>

<p>My lord, I had forgot to tell your Lordship:</p>

<p>Today as I came by I called there–</p>

<p>But I shall grieve you to report the rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  What is ’t, knave?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span></p>

<p>An hour before I came, the Duchess died.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>God for His mercy, what a tide of woes</p>

<p>Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!</p>

<p>I know not what to do. I would to God,</p>

<p>So my untruth had not provoked him to it,</p>

<p>The King had cut off my head with my brother’s!</p>

<p>What, are there no posts dispatched for Ireland?</p>

<p>How shall we do for money for these wars?–</p>

<p>Come, sister–cousin I would say, pray pardon</p>

<p>me.–</p>

<p>Go, fellow, get thee home. Provide some carts</p>

<p>And bring away the armor that is there.</p>

<p><center><i>[Servingman exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Gentlemen, will you go muster men?</p>

<p>If I know how or which way to order these affairs</p>

<p>Thus disorderly thrust into my hands,</p>

<p>Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen.</p>

<p>T’ one is my sovereign, whom both my oath</p>

<p>And duty bids defend; t’ other again</p>

<p>Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wronged,</p>

<p>Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.</p>

<p>Well, somewhat we must do. <i>[To Queen.]</i> Come,</p>

<p>cousin,</p>

<p>I’ll dispose of you.–Gentlemen, go muster up your</p>

<p>men</p>

<p>And meet me presently at Berkeley.</p>

<p>I should to Plashy too,</p>

<p>But time will not permit. All is uneven,</p>

<p>And everything is left at six and seven.</p>

<p><center><i>[Duke of York and Queen exit.</p>

<p>Bushy, Green, and Bagot remain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bushy</span></p>

<p>The wind sits fair for news to go for Ireland,</p>

<p>But none returns. For us to levy power</p>

<p>Proportionable to the enemy</p>

<p>Is all unpossible.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Green</span></p>

<p>Besides, our nearness to the King in love</p>

<p>Is near the hate of those love not the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bagot</span></p>

<p>And that is the wavering commons, for their love</p>

<p>Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them</p>

<p>By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bushy</span></p>

<p>Wherein the King stands generally condemned.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bagot</span></p>

<p>If judgment lie in them, then so do we,</p>

<p>Because we ever have been near the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Green</span></p>

<p>Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristow Castle.</p>

<p>The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bushy</span></p>

<p>Thither will I with you, for little office</p>

<p>Will the hateful commons perform for us,</p>

<p>Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.–</p>

<p>Will you go along with us?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bagot</span></p>

<p>No, I will to Ireland to his Majesty.</p>

<p>Farewell. If heart’s presages be not vain,</p>

<p>We three here part that ne’er shall meet again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bushy</span></p>

<p>That’s as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Green</span></p>

<p>Alas, poor duke, the task he undertakes</p>

<p>Is numb’ring sands and drinking oceans dry.</p>

<p>Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.</p>

<p>Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bushy</span></p>

<p>Well, we may meet again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bagot</span>  I fear me, never.</p>
