<p><center><i>[Enter the Queen with her Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>This way the King will come. This is the way</p>

<p>To Julius Caesar’s ill-erected tower,</p>

<p>To whose flint bosom my condemned lord</p>

<p>Is doomed a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke.</p>

<p>Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth</p>

<p>Have any resting for her true king’s queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Richard and Guard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But soft, but see–or rather do not see</p>

<p>My fair rose wither; yet look up, behold,</p>

<p>That you in pity may dissolve to dew</p>

<p>And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.–</p>

<p>Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,</p>

<p>Thou map of honor, thou King Richard’s tomb,</p>

<p>And not King Richard! Thou most beauteous inn,</p>

<p>Why should hard-favored grief be lodged in thee</p>

<p>When triumph is become an alehouse guest?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,</p>

<p>To make my end too sudden. Learn, good soul,</p>

<p>To think our former state a happy dream,</p>

<p>From which awaked, the truth of what we are</p>

<p>Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,</p>

<p>To grim necessity, and he and I</p>

<p>Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France</p>

<p>And cloister thee in some religious house.</p>

<p>Our holy lives must win a new world’s crown,</p>

<p>Which our profane hours here have thrown down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>What, is my Richard both in shape and mind</p>

<p>Transformed and weakened? Hath Bolingbroke</p>

<p>Deposed thine intellect? Hath he been in thy heart?</p>

<p>The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw</p>

<p>And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage</p>

<p>To be o’er-powered; and wilt thou, pupil-like,</p>

<p>Take the correction, mildly kiss the rod,</p>

<p>And fawn on rage with base humility,</p>

<p>Which art a lion and the king of beasts?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>A king of beasts indeed. If aught but beasts,</p>

<p>I had been still a happy king of men.</p>

<p>Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for</p>

<p>France.</p>

<p>Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,</p>

<p>As from my deathbed, thy last living leave.</p>

<p>In winter’s tedious nights sit by the fire</p>

<p>With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales</p>

<p>Of woeful ages long ago betid;</p>

<p>And, ere thou bid good night, to quite their griefs,</p>

<p>Tell thou the lamentable tale of me,</p>

<p>And send the hearers weeping to their beds.</p>

<p>Forwhy the senseless brands will sympathize</p>

<p>The heavy accent of thy moving tongue,</p>

<p>And in compassion weep the fire out,</p>

<p>And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,</p>

<p>For the deposing of a rightful king.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Northumberland.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed.</p>

<p>You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.–</p>

<p>And madam, there is order ta’en for you.</p>

<p>With all swift speed you must away to France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal</p>

<p>The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,</p>

<p>The time shall not be many hours of age</p>

<p>More than it is ere foul sin, gathering head,</p>

<p>Shall break into corruption. Thou shalt think,</p>

<p>Though he divide the realm and give thee half,</p>

<p>It is too little, helping him to all.</p>

<p>He shall think that thou, which knowest the way</p>

<p>To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,</p>

<p>Being ne’er so little urged another way,</p>

<p>To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.</p>

<p>The love of wicked men converts to fear,</p>

<p>That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both</p>

<p>To worthy danger and deserved death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>My guilt be on my head, and there an end.</p>

<p>Take leave and part, for you must part forthwith.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate</p>

<p>A twofold marriage–twixt my crown and me,</p>

<p>And then betwixt me and my married wife.</p>

<p><i>[To Queen.]</i> Let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and</p>

<p>me;</p>

<p>And yet not so, for with a kiss ’twas made.–</p>

<p>Part us, Northumberland, I towards the north,</p>

<p>Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;</p>

<p>My wife to France, from whence set forth in pomp</p>

<p>She came adorned hither like sweet May,</p>

<p>Sent back like Hallowmas or short’st of day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>And must we be divided? Must we part?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <i>[to Northumberland]</i></p>

<p>Banish us both, and send the King with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Northumberland</sc></p>

<p>That were some love, but little policy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Then whither he goes, thither let me go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>So two together weeping make one woe.</p>

<p>Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;</p>

<p>Better far off than, near, be ne’er the near.</p>

<p>Go, count thy way with sighs, I mine with groans.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>So longest way shall have the longest moans.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>Twice for one step I’ll groan, the way being short,</p>

<p>And piece the way out with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>Come, come, in wooing sorrow let’s be brief,</p>

<p>Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief.</p>

<p>One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part.</p>

<p>Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.</p>

<p><center><i>[They kiss.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Give me mine own again. ’Twere no good part</p>

<p>To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.</p>

<p><center><i>[They kiss.]</i></center></p>

<p>So, now I have mine own again, begone,</p>

<p>That I may strive to kill it with a groan.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Richard</sc></p>

<p>We make woe wanton with this fond delay.</p>

<p>Once more, adieu! The rest let sorrow say.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
