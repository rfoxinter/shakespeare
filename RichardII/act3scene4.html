<p><center><i>[Enter the Queen with her Ladies-in-waiting.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>What sport shall we devise here in this garden</p>

<p>To drive away the heavy thought of care?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc>  Madam, we’ll play at bowls.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>’Twill make me think the world is full of rubs</p>

<p>And that my fortune runs against the bias.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc>  Madam, we’ll dance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>My legs can keep no measure in delight</p>

<p>When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief.</p>

<p>Therefore no dancing, girl. Some other sport.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc>  Madam, we’ll tell tales.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Of sorrow or of joy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc>  Of either, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Of neither, girl,</p>

<p>For if of joy, being altogether wanting,</p>

<p>It doth remember me the more of sorrow;</p>

<p>Or if of grief, being altogether had,</p>

<p>It adds more sorrow to my want of joy.</p>

<p>For what I have I need not to repeat,</p>

<p>And what I want it boots not to complain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc></p>

<p>Madam, I’ll sing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  ’Tis well that thou hast cause,</p>

<p>But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou</p>

<p>weep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc></p>

<p>I could weep, madam, would it do you good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>And I could sing, would weeping do me good,</p>

<p>And never borrow any tear of thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Gardener and two Servingmen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But stay, here come the gardeners.</p>

<p>Let’s step into the shadow of these trees.</p>

<p>My wretchedness unto a row of pins,</p>

<p>They will talk of state, for everyone doth so</p>

<p>Against a change. Woe is forerun with woe.</p>

<p><center><i>[Queen and Ladies step aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gardener</sc> <i>[to one Servingman]</i></p>

<p>Go, bind thou up young dangling apricokes</p>

<p>Which, like unruly children, make their sire</p>

<p>Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight.</p>

<p>Give some supportance to the bending twigs.–</p>

<p>Go thou, and like an executioner</p>

<p>Cut off the heads of too-fast-growing sprays</p>

<p>That look too lofty in our commonwealth.</p>

<p>All must be even in our government.</p>

<p>You thus employed, I will go root away</p>

<p>The noisome weeds which without profit suck</p>

<p>The soil’s fertility from wholesome flowers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Man</sc></p>

<p>Why should we, in the compass of a pale,</p>

<p>Keep law and form and due proportion,</p>

<p>Showing as in a model our firm estate,</p>

<p>When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,</p>

<p>Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,</p>

<p>Her fruit trees all unpruned, her hedges ruined,</p>

<p>Her knots disordered, and her wholesome herbs</p>

<p>Swarming with caterpillars?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gardener</sc>  Hold thy peace.</p>

<p>He that hath suffered this disordered spring</p>

<p>Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf.</p>

<p>The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did</p>

<p>shelter,</p>

<p>That seemed in eating him to hold him up,</p>

<p>Are plucked up, root and all, by Bolingbroke–</p>

<p>I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Man</sc></p>

<p>What, are they dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gardener</sc>  They are. And Bolingbroke</p>

<p>Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it</p>

<p>That he had not so trimmed and dressed his land</p>

<p>As we this garden! We at time of year</p>

<p>Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit trees,</p>

<p>Lest, being overproud in sap and blood,</p>

<p>With too much riches it confound itself.</p>

<p>Had he done so to great and growing men,</p>

<p>They might have lived to bear and he to taste</p>

<p>Their fruits of duty. Superfluous branches</p>

<p>We lop away, that bearing boughs may live.</p>

<p>Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,</p>

<p>Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Man</sc></p>

<p>What, think you the King shall be deposed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gardener</sc></p>

<p>Depressed he is already, and deposed</p>

<p>’Tis doubt he will be. Letters came last night</p>

<p>To a dear friend of the good Duke of York’s</p>

<p>That tell black tidings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>O, I am pressed to death through want of speaking!</p>

<p><center><i>[Stepping forward.]</i></center></p>

<p>Thou old Adam’s likeness, set to dress this garden,</p>

<p>How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this</p>

<p>unpleasing news?</p>

<p>What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee</p>

<p>To make a second fall of cursed man?</p>

<p>Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?</p>

<p>Dar’st thou, thou little better thing than earth,</p>

<p>Divine his downfall? Say where, when, and how</p>

<p>Cam’st thou by this ill tidings? Speak, thou wretch!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gardener</sc></p>

<p>Pardon me, madam. Little joy have I</p>

<p>To breathe this news, yet what I say is true.</p>

<p>King Richard, he is in the mighty hold</p>

<p>Of Bolingbroke. Their fortunes both are weighed.</p>

<p>In your lord’s scale is nothing but himself</p>

<p>And some few vanities that make him light,</p>

<p>But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,</p>

<p>Besides himself, are all the English peers,</p>

<p>And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.</p>

<p>Post you to London and you will find it so.</p>

<p>I speak no more than everyone doth know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,</p>

<p>Doth not thy embassage belong to me,</p>

<p>And am I last that knows it? O, thou thinkest</p>

<p>To serve me last that I may longest keep</p>

<p>Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go</p>

<p>To meet at London London’s king in woe.</p>

<p>What, was I born to this, that my sad look</p>

<p>Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?–</p>

<p>Gard’ner, for telling me these news of woe,</p>

<p>Pray God the plants thou graft’st may never grow.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits with Ladies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gardener</sc></p>

<p>Poor queen, so that thy state might be no worse,</p>

<p>I would my skill were subject to thy curse.</p>

<p>Here did she fall a tear. Here in this place</p>

<p>I’ll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace.</p>

<p>Rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen</p>

<p>In the remembrance of a weeping queen.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
