<p><center><i>[Enter Coriolanus, Volumnia, Virgilia, Menenius,</p>

<p>Cominius, with the young nobility of Rome.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>Come, leave your tears. A brief farewell. The beast</p>

<p>With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,</p>

<p>Where is your ancient courage? You were used</p>

<p>To say extremities was the trier of spirits;</p>

<p>That common chances common men could bear;</p>

<p>That when the sea was calm, all boats alike</p>

<p>Showed mastership in floating; fortune’s blows</p>

<p>When most struck home, being gentle wounded</p>

<p>craves</p>

<p>A noble cunning. You were used to load me</p>

<p>With precepts that would make invincible</p>

<p>The heart that conned them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span></p>

<p>O heavens! O heavens!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Nay, I prithee,</p>

<p>woman–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,</p>

<p>And occupations perish!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  What, what, what!</p>

<p>I shall be loved when I am lacked. Nay, mother,</p>

<p>Resume that spirit when you were wont to say</p>

<p>If you had been the wife of Hercules,</p>

<p>Six of his labors you’d have done and saved</p>

<p>Your husband so much sweat.–Cominius,</p>

<p>Droop not. Adieu.–Farewell, my wife, my mother.</p>

<p>I’ll do well yet.–Thou old and true Menenius,</p>

<p>Thy tears are salter than a younger man’s</p>

<p>And venomous to thine eyes.–My sometime</p>

<p>general,</p>

<p>I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld</p>

<p>Heart-hard’ning spectacles. Tell these sad women</p>

<p>’Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes</p>

<p>As ’tis to laugh at ’em.–My mother, you wot well</p>

<p>My hazards still have been your solace, and–</p>

<p>Believe ’t not lightly–though I go alone,</p>

<p>Like to a lonely dragon that his fen</p>

<p>Makes feared and talked of more than seen, your</p>

<p>son</p>

<p>Will or exceed the common or be caught</p>

<p>With cautelous baits and practice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  My first son,</p>

<p>Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius</p>

<p>With thee awhile. Determine on some course</p>

<p>More than a wild exposure to each chance</p>

<p>That starts i’ th’ way before thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  O the gods!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span></p>

<p>I’ll follow thee a month, devise with thee</p>

<p>Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us</p>

<p>And we of thee; so if the time thrust forth</p>

<p>A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send</p>

<p>O’er the vast world to seek a single man</p>

<p>And lose advantage, which doth ever cool</p>

<p>I’ th’ absence of the needer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Fare you well.</p>

<p>Thou hast years upon thee, and thou art too full</p>

<p>Of the wars’ surfeits to go rove with one</p>

<p>That’s yet unbruised. Bring me but out at gate.–</p>

<p>Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and</p>

<p>My friends of noble touch. When I am forth,</p>

<p>Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.</p>

<p>While I remain above the ground, you shall</p>

<p>Hear from me still, and never of me aught</p>

<p>But what is like me formerly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  That’s worthily</p>

<p>As any ear can hear. Come, let’s not weep.</p>

<p>If I could shake off but one seven years</p>

<p>From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,</p>

<p>I’d with thee every foot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Give me thy hand.</p>

<p>Come.</p>
