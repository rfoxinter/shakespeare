<p><center><i>[Enter Coriolanus with Nobles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>Let them pull all about mine ears, present me</p>

<p>Death on the wheel or at wild horses’ heels,</p>

<p>Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,</p>

<p>That the precipitation might down stretch</p>

<p>Below the beam of sight, yet will I still</p>

<p>Be thus to them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Noble</span>  You do the nobler.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  I muse my mother</p>

<p>Does not approve me further, who was wont</p>

<p>To call them woolen vassals, things created</p>

<p>To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads</p>

<p>In congregations, to yawn, be still, and wonder</p>

<p>When one but of my ordinance stood up</p>

<p>To speak of peace or war.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Volumnia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>I talk of you.</p>

<p>Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me</p>

<p>False to my nature? Rather say I play</p>

<p>The man I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  O sir, sir, sir,</p>

<p>I would have had you put your power well on</p>

<p>Before you had worn it out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Let go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>You might have been enough the man you are</p>

<p>With striving less to be so. Lesser had been</p>

<p>The thwartings of your dispositions if</p>

<p>You had not showed them how you were disposed</p>

<p>Ere they lacked power to cross you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Let them hang!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Ay, and burn too.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Menenius with the Senators.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span> <i>[to Coriolanus]</i></p>

<p>Come, come, you have been too rough, something</p>

<p>too rough.</p>

<p>You must return and mend it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  There’s no remedy,</p>

<p>Unless, by not so doing, our good city</p>

<p>Cleave in the midst and perish.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Pray be counseled.</p>

<p>I have a heart as little apt as yours,</p>

<p>But yet a brain that leads my use of anger</p>

<p>To better vantage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Well said, noble woman.</p>

<p>Before he should thus stoop to th’ herd–but that</p>

<p>The violent fit o’ th’ time craves it as physic</p>

<p>For the whole state–I would put mine armor on,</p>

<p>Which I can scarcely bear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  What must I do?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span></p>

<p>Return to th’ Tribunes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Well, what then? What then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Repent what you have spoke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>For them? I cannot do it to the gods.</p>

<p>Must I then do ’t to them?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  You are too absolute,</p>

<p>Though therein you can never be too noble</p>

<p>But when extremities speak. I have heard you say</p>

<p>Honor and policy, like unsevered friends,</p>

<p>I’ th’ war do grow together. Grant that, and tell me</p>

<p>In peace what each of them by th’ other lose</p>

<p>That they combine not there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Tush, tush!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  A good</p>

<p>demand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>If it be honor in your wars to seem</p>

<p>The same you are not, which for your best ends</p>

<p>You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse</p>

<p>That it shall hold companionship in peace</p>

<p>With honor as in war, since that to both</p>

<p>It stands in like request?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Why force you this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>Because that now it lies you on to speak</p>

<p>To th’ people, not by your own instruction,</p>

<p>Nor by th’ matter which your heart prompts you,</p>

<p>But with such words that are but roted in</p>

<p>Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables</p>

<p>Of no allowance to your bosom’s truth.</p>

<p>Now, this no more dishonors you at all</p>

<p>Than to take in a town with gentle words,</p>

<p>Which else would put you to your fortune and</p>

<p>The hazard of much blood.</p>

<p>I would dissemble with my nature where</p>

<p>My fortunes and my friends at stake required</p>

<p>I should do so in honor. I am in this</p>

<p>Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;</p>

<p>And you will rather show our general louts</p>

<p>How you can frown than spend a fawn upon ’em</p>

<p>For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard</p>

<p>Of what that want might ruin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Noble lady!–</p>

<p>Come, go with us; speak fair. You may salve so,</p>

<p>Not what is dangerous present, but the loss</p>

<p>Of what is past.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  I prithee now, my son,</p>

<p>Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand,</p>

<p>And thus far having stretched it–here be with</p>

<p>them–</p>

<p>Thy knee bussing the stones–for in such business</p>

<p>Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th’ ignorant</p>

<p>More learned than the ears–waving thy head,</p>

<p>Which often thus correcting thy stout heart,</p>

<p>Now humble as the ripest mulberry</p>

<p>That will not hold the handling. Or say to them</p>

<p>Thou art their soldier and, being bred in broils,</p>

<p>Hast not the soft way, which thou dost confess</p>

<p>Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,</p>

<p>In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame</p>

<p>Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far</p>

<p>As thou hast power and person.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  This but done</p>

<p>Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;</p>

<p>For they have pardons, being asked, as free</p>

<p>As words to little purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Prithee now,</p>

<p>Go, and be ruled; although I know thou hadst rather</p>

<p>Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf</p>

<p>Than flatter him in a bower.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cominius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here is Cominius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span></p>

<p>I have been i’ th’ marketplace; and, sir, ’tis fit</p>

<p>You make strong party or defend yourself</p>

<p>By calmness or by absence. All’s in anger.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span></p>

<p>Only fair speech.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  I think ’twill serve, if he</p>

<p>Can thereto frame his spirit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  He must, and will.–</p>

<p>Prithee, now, say you will, and go about it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce? Must I</p>

<p>With my base tongue give to my noble heart</p>

<p>A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do ’t.</p>

<p>Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,</p>

<p>This mold of Martius, they to dust should grind it</p>

<p>And throw ’t against the wind. To th’ marketplace!</p>

<p>You have put me now to such a part which never</p>

<p>I shall discharge to th’ life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Come, come, we’ll prompt</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said</p>

<p>My praises made thee first a soldier, so,</p>

<p>To have my praise for this, perform a part</p>

<p>Thou hast not done before.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Well, I must do ’t.</p>

<p>Away, my disposition, and possess me</p>

<p>Some harlot’s spirit! My throat of war be turned,</p>

<p>Which choired with my drum, into a pipe</p>

<p>Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice</p>

<p>That babies lull asleep! The smiles of knaves</p>

<p>Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys’ tears take up</p>

<p>The glasses of my sight! A beggar’s tongue</p>

<p>Make motion through my lips, and my armed knees,</p>

<p>Who bowed but in my stirrup, bend like his</p>

<p>That hath received an alms. I will not do ’t,</p>

<p>Lest I surcease to honor mine own truth</p>

<p>And, by my body’s action, teach my mind</p>

<p>A most inherent baseness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  At thy choice, then.</p>

<p>To beg of thee, it is my more dishonor</p>

<p>Than thou of them. Come all to ruin. Let</p>

<p>Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear</p>

<p>Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death</p>

<p>With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list.</p>

<p>Thy valiantness was mine; thou suck’st it from me,</p>

<p>But owe thy pride thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Pray be content.</p>

<p>Mother, I am going to the marketplace.</p>

<p>Chide me no more. I’ll mountebank their loves,</p>

<p>Cog their hearts from them, and come home</p>

<p>beloved</p>

<p>Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going.</p>

<p>Commend me to my wife. I’ll return consul,</p>

<p>Or never trust to what my tongue can do</p>

<p>I’ th’ way of flattery further.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Do your will.</p>

<p><center><i>[Volumnia exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span></p>

<p>Away! The Tribunes do attend you. Arm yourself</p>

<p>To answer mildly, for they are prepared</p>

<p>With accusations, as I hear, more strong</p>

<p>Than are upon you yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>The word is “mildly.” Pray you, let us go.</p>

<p>Let them accuse me by invention, I</p>

<p>Will answer in mine honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Ay, but mildly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Well, mildly be it, then. Mildly.</p>
