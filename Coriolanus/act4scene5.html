<p><center><i>[Music plays. Enter a Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Wine, wine, wine! What service is</p>

<p>here? I think our fellows are asleep.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter another Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Where’s Cotus? My master calls</p>

<p>for him. Cotus!     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Coriolanus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>A goodly house. The feast smells well, but I</p>

<p>Appear not like a guest.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the First Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  What would you have, friend?</p>

<p>Whence are you? Here’s no place for you. Pray, go</p>

<p>to the door.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>I have deserved no better entertainment</p>

<p>In being Coriolanus.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Second Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Whence are you, sir?–Has the</p>

<p>porter his eyes in his head, that he gives entrance</p>

<p>to such companions?–Pray, get you out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Away!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Away? Get you away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Now th’ art troublesome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Are you so brave? I’ll have you</p>

<p>talked with anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Third Servingman; the First, entering,</p>

<p>meets him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  What fellow’s this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  A strange one as ever I looked on. I</p>

<p>cannot get him out o’ th’ house. Prithee, call my</p>

<p>master to him.     <i><i>[He steps aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  What have you to do here, fellow?</p>

<p>Pray you, avoid the house.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Let me but stand. I will not hurt your</p>

<p>hearth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  What are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  A gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  A marv’llous poor one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  True, so I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Pray you, poor gentleman, take up</p>

<p>some other station. Here’s no place for you. Pray</p>

<p>you, avoid. Come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Follow your function, go, and batten on</p>

<p>cold bits.     <i><i>[Pushes him away from him.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  What, you will not?–Prithee, tell</p>

<p>my master what a strange guest he has here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  And I shall.</p>

<p><center><i>[Second Servingman exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Where dwell’st thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Under the canopy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Under the canopy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Where’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  I’ th’ city of kites and crows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  I’ th’ city of kites and crows? What</p>

<p>an ass it is! Then thou dwell’st with daws too?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  No, I serve not thy master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  How, sir? Do you meddle with my</p>

<p>master?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Ay, ’tis an honester service than to meddle</p>

<p>with thy mistress. Thou prat’st and prat’st. Serve</p>

<p>with thy trencher. Hence!     <i><i>[Beats him away.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[Third Servingman exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Aufidius with the Second Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span>  Where is this fellow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Here, sir. I’d have beaten him like</p>

<p>a dog, but for disturbing the lords within.</p>

<p><center><i>[He steps aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span>  Whence com’st thou? What wouldst thou?</p>

<p>Thy name? Why speak’st not? Speak, man. What’s</p>

<p>thy name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span> <i>[removing his muffler]</i>  If, Tullus,</p>

<p>Not yet thou know’st me, and seeing me, dost not</p>

<p>Think me for the man I am, necessity</p>

<p>Commands me name myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span>  What is thy name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>A name unmusical to the Volscians’ ears</p>

<p>And harsh in sound to thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span>  Say, what’s thy name?</p>

<p>Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face</p>

<p>Bears a command in ’t. Though thy tackle’s torn,</p>

<p>Thou show’st a noble vessel. What’s thy name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>Prepare thy brow to frown. Know’st thou me yet?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span>  I know thee not. Thy name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>My name is Caius Martius, who hath done</p>

<p>To thee particularly and to all the Volsces</p>

<p>Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may</p>

<p>My surname Coriolanus. The painful service,</p>

<p>The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood</p>

<p>Shed for my thankless country are requited</p>

<p>But with that surname, a good memory</p>

<p>And witness of the malice and displeasure</p>

<p>Which thou shouldst bear me. Only that name</p>

<p>remains.</p>

<p>The cruelty and envy of the people,</p>

<p>Permitted by our dastard nobles, who</p>

<p>Have all forsook me, hath devoured the rest,</p>

<p>And suffered me by th’ voice of slaves to be</p>

<p>Whooped out of Rome. Now this extremity</p>

<p>Hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope–</p>

<p>Mistake me not–to save my life; for if</p>

<p>I had feared death, of all the men i’ th’ world</p>

<p>I would have ’voided thee, but in mere spite,</p>

<p>To be full quit of those my banishers,</p>

<p>Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast</p>

<p>A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge</p>

<p>Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims</p>

<p>Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee</p>

<p>straight</p>

<p>And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it</p>

<p>That my revengeful services may prove</p>

<p>As benefits to thee, for I will fight</p>

<p>Against my cankered country with the spleen</p>

<p>Of all the under fiends. But if so be</p>

<p>Thou dar’st not this, and that to prove more fortunes</p>

<p>Thou ’rt tired, then, in a word, I also am</p>

<p>Longer to live most weary, and present</p>

<p>My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice,</p>

<p>Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,</p>

<p>Since I have ever followed thee with hate,</p>

<p>Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country’s breast,</p>

<p>And cannot live but to thy shame, unless</p>

<p>It be to do thee service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span>  O Martius, Martius,</p>

<p>Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my</p>

<p>heart</p>

<p>A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter</p>

<p>Should from yond cloud speak divine things</p>

<p>And say ’tis true, I’d not believe them more</p>

<p>Than thee, all-noble Martius. Let me twine</p>

<p>Mine arms about that body, whereagainst</p>

<p>My grained ash an hundred times hath broke</p>

<p>And scarred the moon with splinters.</p>

<p><center><i>[They embrace.]</i></center></p>

<p>Here I clip</p>

<p>The anvil of my sword and do contest</p>

<p>As hotly and as nobly with thy love</p>

<p>As ever in ambitious strength I did</p>

<p>Contend against thy valor. Know thou first,</p>

<p>I loved the maid I married; never man</p>

<p>Sighed truer breath. But that I see thee here,</p>

<p>Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart</p>

<p>Than when I first my wedded mistress saw</p>

<p>Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars, I tell thee</p>

<p>We have a power on foot, and I had purpose</p>

<p>Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn</p>

<p>Or lose mine arm for ’t. Thou hast beat me out</p>

<p>Twelve several times, and I have nightly since</p>

<p>Dreamt of encounters ’twixt thyself and me;</p>

<p>We have been down together in my sleep,</p>

<p>Unbuckling helms, fisting each other’s throat,</p>

<p>And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Martius,</p>

<p>Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that</p>

<p>Thou art thence banished, we would muster all</p>

<p>From twelve to seventy and, pouring war</p>

<p>Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,</p>

<p>Like a bold flood o’erbear ’t. O, come, go in,</p>

<p>And take our friendly senators by th’ hands,</p>

<p>Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,</p>

<p>Who am prepared against your territories,</p>

<p>Though not for Rome itself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  You bless me, gods!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span></p>

<p>Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have</p>

<p>The leading of thine own revenges, take</p>

<p>Th’ one half of my commission and set down–</p>

<p>As best thou art experienced, since thou know’st</p>

<p>Thy country’s strength and weakness–thine own</p>

<p>ways,</p>

<p>Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,</p>

<p>Or rudely visit them in parts remote</p>

<p>To fright them ere destroy. But come in.</p>

<p>Let me commend thee first to those that shall</p>

<p>Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!</p>

<p>And more a friend than ere an enemy–</p>

<p>Yet, Martius, that was much. Your hand. Most</p>

<p>welcome!     <i><i>[Coriolanus and Aufidius exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Two of the Servingmen come forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Here’s a strange alteration!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  By my hand, I had thought to</p>

<p>have strucken him with a cudgel, and yet my mind</p>

<p>gave me his clothes made a false report of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  What an arm he has! He turned me</p>

<p>about with his finger and his thumb as one would</p>

<p>set up a top.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Nay, I knew by his face that there</p>

<p>was something in him. He had, sir, a kind of face,</p>

<p>methought–I cannot tell how to term it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  He had so, looking as it were–</p>

<p>Would I were hanged but I thought there was</p>

<p>more in him than I could think.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  So did I, I’ll be sworn. He is simply</p>

<p>the rarest man i’ th’ world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  I think he is. But a greater soldier</p>

<p>than he you wot one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Who, my master?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Nay, it’s no matter for that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Worth six on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Nay, not so neither. But I take him</p>

<p>to be the greater soldier.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Faith, look you, one cannot tell</p>

<p>how to say that. For the defense of a town our general</p>

<p>is excellent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Ay, and for an assault too.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Third Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  O slaves, I can tell you news, news,</p>

<p>you rascals!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span>  What, what, what? Let’s partake!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  I would not be a Roman, of all nations;</p>

<p>I had as lief be a condemned man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span>  Wherefore? Wherefore?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Why, here’s he that was wont to</p>

<p>thwack our general, Caius Martius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Why do you say “thwack our</p>

<p>general”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  I do not say “thwack our general,”</p>

<p>but he was always good enough for him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Come, we are fellows and friends.</p>

<p>He was ever too hard for him; I have heard him</p>

<p>say so himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  He was too hard for him directly, to</p>

<p>say the truth on ’t, before Corioles; he scotched</p>

<p>him and notched him like a carbonado.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  An he had been cannibally given,</p>

<p>he might have boiled and eaten him too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  But, more of thy news.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Why, he is so made on here within</p>

<p>as if he were son and heir to Mars; set at upper end</p>

<p>o’ th’ table; no question asked him by any of the</p>

<p>senators but they stand bald before him. Our general</p>

<p>himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies</p>

<p>himself with ’s hand, and turns up the white o’ th’</p>

<p>eye to his discourse. But the bottom of the news is,</p>

<p>our general is cut i’ th’ middle and but one half of</p>

<p>what he was yesterday, for the other has half, by</p>

<p>the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He’ll go,</p>

<p>he says, and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th’</p>

<p>ears. He will mow all down before him and leave</p>

<p>his passage polled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  And he’s as like to do ’t as any</p>

<p>man I can imagine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Do ’t? He will do ’t! For, look you,</p>

<p>sir, he has as many friends as enemies, which</p>

<p>friends, sir, as it were, durst not, look you, sir, show</p>

<p>themselves, as we term it, his friends whilest he’s</p>

<p>in directitude.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Directitude? What’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  But when they shall see, sir, his</p>

<p>crest up again, and the man in blood, they will out</p>

<p>of their burrows like coneys after rain, and revel</p>

<p>all with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  But when goes this forward?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Tomorrow, today, presently. You</p>

<p>shall have the drum struck up this afternoon. ’Tis,</p>

<p>as it were, a parcel of their feast, and to be executed</p>

<p>ere they wipe their lips.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Why then, we shall have a stirring</p>

<p>world again. This peace is nothing but to rust iron,</p>

<p>increase tailors, and breed ballad-makers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Let me have war, say I. It exceeds</p>

<p>peace as far as day does night. It’s sprightly walking,</p>

<p>audible, and full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy,</p>

<p>lethargy; mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter</p>

<p>of more bastard children than war’s a destroyer of</p>

<p>men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  ’Tis so, and as wars in some sort</p>

<p>may be said to be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied</p>

<p>but peace is a great maker of cuckolds.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Ay, and it makes men hate one</p>

<p>another.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Reason: because they then less</p>

<p>need one another. The wars for my money! I hope</p>

<p>to see Romans as cheap as Volscians. <i>[(Noise</p>

<p>within.)]</i> They are rising; they are rising.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>And</span> <span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servingmen</span>  In, in, in, in!</p>
