<p><center><i>[Enter Menenius with the two Tribunes of the people,</p>

<p>Sicinius and Brutus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  The augurer tells me we shall have news</p>

<p>tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Good or bad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Not according to the prayer of the people,</p>

<p>for they love not Martius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Pray you, who does the wolf love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  The lamb.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians</p>

<p>would the noble Martius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  He’s a lamb indeed, that baas like a bear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  He’s a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb.</p>

<p>You two are old men; tell me one thing that I shall</p>

<p>ask you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>  Well, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  In what enormity is Martius poor in, that</p>

<p>you two have not in abundance?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  He’s poor in no one fault, but stored with all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Especially in pride.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  And topping all others in boasting.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  This is strange now. Do you two know how</p>

<p>you are censured here in the city, I mean of us o’</p>

<p>th’ right-hand file, do you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>  Why, how are we censured?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Because you talk of pride now, will you not</p>

<p>be angry?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>  Well, well, sir, well?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Why, ’tis no great matter; for a very little</p>

<p>thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience.</p>

<p>Give your dispositions the reins, and be</p>

<p>angry at your pleasures, at the least, if you take it</p>

<p>as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame Martius</p>

<p>for being proud.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  We do it not alone, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  I know you can do very little alone, for</p>

<p>your helps are many, or else your actions would</p>

<p>grow wondrous single. Your abilities are too infantlike</p>

<p>for doing much alone. You talk of pride. O,</p>

<p>that you could turn your eyes toward the napes</p>

<p>of your necks and make but an interior survey of</p>

<p>your good selves! O, that you could!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>  What then, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Why, then you should discover a brace of</p>

<p>unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias</p>

<p>fools, as any in Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Menenius, you are known well enough, too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  I am known to be a humorous patrician and</p>

<p>one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of</p>

<p>allaying Tiber in ’t; said to be something imperfect</p>

<p>in favoring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like</p>

<p>upon too trivial motion; one that converses</p>

<p>more with the buttock of the night than with the</p>

<p>forehead of the morning. What I think I utter,</p>

<p>and spend my malice in my breath. Meeting two</p>

<p>such wealsmen as you are–I cannot call you</p>

<p>Lycurguses–if the drink you give me touch my</p>

<p>palate adversely, I make a crooked face at it. I cannot</p>

<p>say your Worships have delivered the matter</p>

<p>well when I find the ass in compound with the</p>

<p>major part of your syllables. And though I must</p>

<p>be content to bear with those that say you are reverend</p>

<p>grave men, yet they lie deadly that tell you</p>

<p>have good faces. If you see this in the map of my</p>

<p>microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough</p>

<p>too? What harm can your bisson conspectuities</p>

<p>glean out of this character, if I be known well</p>

<p>enough, too?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Come, sir, come; we know you well enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.</p>

<p>You are ambitious for poor knaves’ caps</p>

<p>and legs. You wear out a good wholesome forenoon</p>

<p>in hearing a cause between an orange-wife</p>

<p>and a faucet-seller, and then rejourn the controversy</p>

<p>of threepence to a second day of audience.</p>

<p>When you are hearing a matter between party and</p>

<p>party, if you chance to be pinched with the colic,</p>

<p>you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody</p>

<p>flag against all patience, and, in roaring for a</p>

<p>chamber pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding,</p>

<p>the more entangled by your hearing. All the peace</p>

<p>you make in their cause is calling both the parties</p>

<p>knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Come, come. You are well understood to be a</p>

<p>perfecter giber for the table than a necessary</p>

<p>bencher in the Capitol.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Our very priests must become mockers if</p>

<p>they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as</p>

<p>you are. When you speak best unto the purpose, it</p>

<p>is not worth the wagging of your beards, and your</p>

<p>beards deserve not so honorable a grave as to</p>

<p>stuff a botcher’s cushion or to be entombed in an</p>

<p>ass’s packsaddle. Yet you must be saying Martius is</p>

<p>proud, who, in a cheap estimation, is worth all</p>

<p>your predecessors since Deucalion, though peradventure</p>

<p>some of the best of ’em were hereditary</p>

<p>hangmen. Good e’en to your Worships. More of</p>

<p>your conversation would infect my brain, being</p>

<p>the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians. I will be</p>

<p>bold to take my leave of you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He begins to exit. Brutus and Sicinius stand aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and Valeria.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, my as fair as noble ladies–and the</p>

<p>moon, were she earthly, no nobler–whither do</p>

<p>you follow your eyes so fast?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  Honorable Menenius, my boy Martius approaches.</p>

<p>For the love of Juno, let’s go!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Ha? Martius coming home?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous</p>

<p>approbation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee! <i>[(He</p>

<p>throws his cap in the air.)]</i> Hoo! Martius coming</p>

<p>home?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valeria</sc> <sc>Virgilia</sc>  Nay, ’tis true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  Look, here’s a letter from him. <i>[She produces</p>

<p>a paper.]</i> The state hath another, his wife another,</p>

<p>and I think there’s one at home for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  I will make my very house reel tonight. A</p>

<p>letter for me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Virgilia</sc>  Yes, certain, there’s a letter for you; I saw ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  A letter for me? It gives me an estate of</p>

<p>seven years’ health, in which time I will make a lip</p>

<p>at the physician. The most sovereign prescription</p>

<p>in Galen is but empiricutic and, to this preservative,</p>

<p>of no better report than a horse drench. Is he not</p>

<p>wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Virgilia</sc>  O no, no, no!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings he</p>

<p>victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  On ’s brows, Menenius. He comes the third</p>

<p>time home with the oaken garland.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  Titus Lartius writes they fought together,</p>

<p>but Aufidius got off.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  And ’twas time for him too, I’ll warrant him</p>

<p>that. An he had stayed by him, I would not have</p>

<p>been so ’fidiused for all the chests in Corioles and</p>

<p>the gold that’s in them. Is the Senate possessed of</p>

<p>this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  Good ladies, let’s go.–Yes, yes, yes. The</p>

<p>Senate has letters from the General, wherein he</p>

<p>gives my son the whole name of the war. He hath</p>

<p>in this action outdone his former deeds doubly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Valeria</sc>  In troth, there’s wondrous things spoke of</p>

<p>him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Wondrous? Ay, I warrant you, and not without</p>

<p>his true purchasing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Virgilia</sc>  The gods grant them true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  True? Pow waw!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  True? I’ll be sworn they are true. Where is</p>

<p>he wounded? <i>[(To the Tribunes.)]</i> God save your</p>

<p>good Worships! Martius is coming home; he has</p>

<p>more cause to be proud.–Where is he wounded?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  I’ th’ shoulder and i’ th’ left arm. There will</p>

<p>be large cicatrices to show the people when he</p>

<p>shall stand for his place. He received in the repulse</p>

<p>of Tarquin seven hurts i’ th’ body.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  One i’ th’ neck and two i’ th’ thigh–there’s</p>

<p>nine that I know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five</p>

<p>wounds upon him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Now it’s twenty-seven. Every gash was an</p>

<p>enemy’s grave. <i>[(A shout and flourish.)]</i> Hark, the</p>

<p>trumpets!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  These are the ushers of Martius: before him</p>

<p>he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.</p>

<p>Death, that dark spirit, in ’s nervy arm doth lie,</p>

<p>Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.</p>

<p><center><i>[A sennet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cominius the General and Titus Lartius, between</p>

<p>them Coriolanus crowned with an oaken garland, with</p>

<p>Captains and Soldiers and a Herald. Trumpets sound.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Herald</sc></p>

<p>Know, Rome, that all alone Martius did fight</p>

<p>Within Corioles’ gates, where he hath won,</p>

<p>With fame, a name to Martius Caius; these</p>

<p>In honor follows “Coriolanus.”</p>

<p>Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sound flourish.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc></p>

<p>Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>No more of this. It does offend my heart.</p>

<p>Pray now, no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  Look, sir, your mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  O,</p>

<p>You have, I know, petitioned all the gods</p>

<p>For my prosperity.     <i><i>[Kneels.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  Nay, my good soldier, up.</p>

<p><center><i>[He stands.]</i></center></p>

<p>My gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and</p>

<p>By deed-achieving honor newly named–</p>

<p>What is it? Coriolanus must I call thee?</p>

<p>But, O, thy wife–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  My gracious silence, hail.</p>

<p>Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined</p>

<p>home,</p>

<p>That weep’st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,</p>

<p>Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear</p>

<p>And mothers that lack sons.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Now the gods crown</p>

<p>thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>And live you yet? <i>[(To Valeria.)]</i> O, my sweet lady,</p>

<p>pardon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc></p>

<p>I know not where to turn. O, welcome home!–</p>

<p>And, welcome, general.–And you’re welcome all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>A hundred thousand welcomes! I could weep,</p>

<p>And I could laugh; I am light and heavy. Welcome.</p>

<p>A curse begin at very root on ’s heart</p>

<p>That is not glad to see thee! You are three</p>

<p>That Rome should dote on; yet, by the faith of men,</p>

<p>We have some old crab trees here at home that will</p>

<p>not</p>

<p>Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors!</p>

<p>We call a nettle but a nettle, and</p>

<p>The faults of fools but folly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  Ever right.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Menenius ever, ever.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Herald</sc></p>

<p>Give way there, and go on!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc> <i>[to Volumnia and Virgilia]</i>  Your hand</p>

<p>and yours.</p>

<p>Ere in our own house I do shade my head,</p>

<p>The good patricians must be visited,</p>

<p>From whom I have received not only greetings,</p>

<p>But with them change of honors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volumnia</sc>  I have lived</p>

<p>To see inherited my very wishes</p>

<p>And the buildings of my fancy. Only</p>

<p>There’s one thing wanting, which I doubt not but</p>

<p>Our Rome will cast upon thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Know, good mother,</p>

<p>I had rather be their servant in my way</p>

<p>Than sway with them in theirs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  On, to the Capitol.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish of cornets. They exit in state, as before.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Brutus and Sicinius come forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights</p>

<p>Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse</p>

<p>Into a rapture lets her baby cry</p>

<p>While she chats him. The kitchen malkin pins</p>

<p>Her richest lockram ’bout her reechy neck,</p>

<p>Clamb’ring the walls to eye him. Stalls, bulks,</p>

<p>windows</p>

<p>Are smothered up, leads filled, and ridges horsed</p>

<p>With variable complexions, all agreeing</p>

<p>In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens</p>

<p>Do press among the popular throngs and puff</p>

<p>To win a vulgar station. Our veiled dames</p>

<p>Commit the war of white and damask in</p>

<p>Their nicely-gauded cheeks to th’ wanton spoil</p>

<p>Of Phoebus’ burning kisses. Such a pother,</p>

<p>As if that whatsoever god who leads him</p>

<p>Were slyly crept into his human powers</p>

<p>And gave him graceful posture.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  On the sudden</p>

<p>I warrant him consul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Then our office may,</p>

<p>During his power, go sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>He cannot temp’rately transport his honors</p>

<p>From where he should begin and end, but will</p>

<p>Lose those he hath won.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  In that there’s comfort.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Doubt</p>

<p>not</p>

<p>The commoners, for whom we stand, but they</p>

<p>Upon their ancient malice will forget</p>

<p>With the least cause these his new honors–which</p>

<p>That he will give them make I as little question</p>

<p>As he is proud to do ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  I heard him swear,</p>

<p>Were he to stand for consul, never would he</p>

<p>Appear i’ th’ marketplace nor on him put</p>

<p>The napless vesture of humility,</p>

<p>Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds</p>

<p>To th’ people, beg their stinking breaths.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  ’Tis right.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>It was his word. O, he would miss it rather</p>

<p>Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him</p>

<p>And the desire of the nobles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  I wish no better</p>

<p>Than have him hold that purpose and to put it</p>

<p>In execution.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  ’Tis most like he will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>It shall be to him then as our good wills,</p>

<p>A sure destruction.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  So it must fall out</p>

<p>To him, or our authority’s for an end.</p>

<p>We must suggest the people in what hatred</p>

<p>He still hath held them; that to ’s power he would</p>

<p>Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders, and</p>

<p>Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them</p>

<p>In human action and capacity</p>

<p>Of no more soul nor fitness for the world</p>

<p>Than camels in their war, who have their provand</p>

<p>Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows</p>

<p>For sinking under them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  This, as you say, suggested</p>

<p>At some time when his soaring insolence</p>

<p>Shall touch the people–which time shall not want</p>

<p>If he be put upon ’t, and that’s as easy</p>

<p>As to set dogs on sheep–will be his fire</p>

<p>To kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze</p>

<p>Shall darken him forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>You are sent for to the Capitol. ’Tis thought</p>

<p>That Martius shall be consul. I have seen</p>

<p>The dumb men throng to see him, and the blind</p>

<p>To hear him speak; matrons flung gloves,</p>

<p>Ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs,</p>

<p>Upon him as he passed; the nobles bended</p>

<p>As to Jove’s statue, and the Commons made</p>

<p>A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.</p>

<p>I never saw the like.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Let’s to the Capitol,</p>

<p>And carry with us ears and eyes for th’ time,</p>

<p>But hearts for the event.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Have with you.</p>
