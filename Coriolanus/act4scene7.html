<p><center><i>[Enter Aufidius with his Lieutenant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span>  Do they still fly to th’ Roman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lieutenant</span></p>

<p>I do not know what witchcraft’s in him, but</p>

<p>Your soldiers use him as the grace ’fore meat,</p>

<p>Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;</p>

<p>And you are dark’ned in this action, sir,</p>

<p>Even by your own.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span>  I cannot help it now,</p>

<p>Unless by using means I lame the foot</p>

<p>Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,</p>

<p>Even to my person, than I thought he would</p>

<p>When first I did embrace him. Yet his nature</p>

<p>In that’s no changeling, and I must excuse</p>

<p>What cannot be amended.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lieutenant</span>  Yet I wish, sir–</p>

<p>I mean for your particular–you had not</p>

<p>Joined in commission with him, but either</p>

<p>Have borne the action of yourself or else</p>

<p>To him had left it solely.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span></p>

<p>I understand thee well, and be thou sure,</p>

<p>When he shall come to his account, he knows not</p>

<p>What I can urge against him, although it seems,</p>

<p>And so he thinks and is no less apparent</p>

<p>To th’ vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly,</p>

<p>And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,</p>

<p>Fights dragonlike, and does achieve as soon</p>

<p>As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone</p>

<p>That which shall break his neck or hazard mine</p>

<p>Whene’er we come to our account.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lieutenant</span></p>

<p>Sir, I beseech you, think you he’ll carry Rome?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span></p>

<p>All places yields to him ere he sits down,</p>

<p>And the nobility of Rome are his;</p>

<p>The Senators and Patricians love him too.</p>

<p>The Tribunes are no soldiers, and their people</p>

<p>Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty</p>

<p>To expel him thence. I think he’ll be to Rome</p>

<p>As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it</p>

<p>By sovereignty of nature. First, he was</p>

<p>A noble servant to them, but he could not</p>

<p>Carry his honors even. Whether ’twas pride,</p>

<p>Which out of daily fortune ever taints</p>

<p>The happy man; whether defect of judgment,</p>

<p>To fail in the disposing of those chances</p>

<p>Which he was lord of; or whether nature,</p>

<p>Not to be other than one thing, not moving</p>

<p>From th’ casque to th’ cushion, but commanding</p>

<p>peace</p>

<p>Even with the same austerity and garb</p>

<p>As he controlled the war; but one of these–</p>

<p>As he hath spices of them all–not all,</p>

<p>For I dare so far free him–made him feared,</p>

<p>So hated, and so banished. But he has a merit</p>

<p>To choke it in the utt’rance. So our virtues</p>

<p>Lie in th’ interpretation of the time,</p>

<p>And power, unto itself most commendable,</p>

<p>Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair</p>

<p>T’ extol what it hath done.</p>

<p>One fire drives out one fire, one nail one nail;</p>

<p>Rights by rights falter; strengths by strengths do</p>

<p>fail.</p>

<p>Come, let’s away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,</p>

<p>Thou art poor’st of all; then shortly art thou mine.</p>
