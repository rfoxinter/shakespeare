<p><center><i>[Enter the two Tribunes. Sicinius and Brutus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>We hear not of him, neither need we fear him.</p>

<p>His remedies are tame–the present peace,</p>

<p>And quietness of the people, which before</p>

<p>Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends</p>

<p>Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,</p>

<p>Though they themselves did suffer by ’t, behold</p>

<p>Dissentious numbers pest’ring streets than see</p>

<p>Our tradesmen singing in their shops and going</p>

<p>About their functions friendly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>We stood to ’t in good time.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Menenius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Is this Menenius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>’Tis he, ’tis he. O, he is grown most kind</p>

<p>Of late.–Hail, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Hail to you both.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>Your Coriolanus is not much missed</p>

<p>But with his friends. The commonwealth doth stand,</p>

<p>And so would do were he more angry at it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>All’s well, and might have been much better if</p>

<p>He could have temporized.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Where is he, hear you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Nay, I hear nothing;</p>

<p>His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter three or four Citizens.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Citizens</sc> <i>[to the Tribunes]</i></p>

<p>The gods preserve</p>

<p>you both!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Good e’en, our neighbors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Good e’en to you all, good e’en to you all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees</p>

<p>Are bound to pray for you both.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Live, and thrive!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, kind neighbors. We wished Coriolanus</p>

<p>Had loved you as we did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Citizens</sc>  Now the gods keep you!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc> <sc>Tribunes</sc>  Farewell, farewell.     <i><i>[Citizens exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>This is a happier and more comely time</p>

<p>Than when these fellows ran about the streets</p>

<p>Crying confusion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Caius Martius was</p>

<p>A worthy officer i’ th’ war, but insolent,</p>

<p>O’ercome with pride, ambitious, past all thinking</p>

<p>Self-loving.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>And affecting one sole throne, without assistance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  I think not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>We should by this, to all our lamentation,</p>

<p>If he had gone forth consul, found it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>The gods have well prevented it, and Rome</p>

<p>Sits safe and still without him.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter an Aedile.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aedile</sc>  Worthy tribunes,</p>

<p>There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,</p>

<p>Reports the Volsces with two several powers</p>

<p>Are entered in the Roman territories,</p>

<p>And with the deepest malice of the war</p>

<p>Destroy what lies before ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  ’Tis Aufidius,</p>

<p>Who, hearing of our Martius’ banishment,</p>

<p>Thrusts forth his horns again into the world,</p>

<p>Which were inshelled when Martius stood for Rome,</p>

<p>And durst not once peep out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Come, what talk you of Martius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Go see this rumorer whipped. It cannot be</p>

<p>The Volsces dare break with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Cannot be?</p>

<p>We have record that very well it can,</p>

<p>And three examples of the like hath been</p>

<p>Within my age. But reason with the fellow</p>

<p>Before you punish him, where he heard this,</p>

<p>Lest you shall chance to whip your information</p>

<p>And beat the messenger who bids beware</p>

<p>Of what is to be dreaded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Tell not me.</p>

<p>I know this cannot be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Not possible.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>The nobles in great earnestness are going</p>

<p>All to the Senate House. Some news is coming</p>

<p>That turns their countenances.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  ’Tis this slave–</p>

<p>Go whip him ’fore the people’s eyes–his raising,</p>

<p>Nothing but his report.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  Yes, worthy sir,</p>

<p>The slave’s report is seconded, and more,</p>

<p>More fearful, is delivered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  What more fearful?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>It is spoke freely out of many mouths–</p>

<p>How probable I do not know–that Martius,</p>

<p>Joined with Aufidius, leads a power ’gainst Rome</p>

<p>And vows revenge as spacious as between</p>

<p>The young’st and oldest thing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  This is most likely!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Raised only that the weaker sort may wish</p>

<p>Good Martius home again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  The very trick on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  This is unlikely;</p>

<p>He and Aufidius can no more atone</p>

<p>Than violent’st contrariety.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Second Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Messenger</sc>  You are sent for to the Senate.</p>

<p>A fearful army, led by Caius Martius</p>

<p>Associated with Aufidius, rages</p>

<p>Upon our territories, and have already</p>

<p>O’erborne their way, consumed with fire and took</p>

<p>What lay before them.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cominius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc> <i>[to the Tribunes]</i>  O, you have made good</p>

<p>work!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  What news? What news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc> <i>[to the Tribunes]</i></p>

<p>You have holp to ravish your own daughters and</p>

<p>To melt the city leads upon your pates,</p>

<p>To see your wives dishonored to your noses–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  What’s the news? What’s the news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc> <i>[to the Tribunes]</i></p>

<p>Your temples burned in their cement, and</p>

<p>Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined</p>

<p>Into an auger’s bore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Pray now, your news?–</p>

<p>You have made fair work, I fear me.–Pray, your</p>

<p>news?</p>

<p>If Martius should be joined with Volscians–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  If?</p>

<p>He is their god; he leads them like a thing</p>

<p>Made by some other deity than Nature,</p>

<p>That shapes man better; and they follow him</p>

<p>Against us brats with no less confidence</p>

<p>Than boys pursuing summer butterflies</p>

<p>Or butchers killing flies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc> <i>[to the Tribunes]</i>  You have made good work,</p>

<p>You and your apron-men, you that stood so much</p>

<p>Upon the voice of occupation and</p>

<p>The breath of garlic eaters!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc></p>

<p>He’ll shake your Rome about your ears.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>As Hercules did shake down mellow fruit.</p>

<p>You have made fair work.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  But is this true, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  Ay, and you’ll look pale</p>

<p>Before you find it other. All the regions</p>

<p>Do smilingly revolt, and who resists</p>

<p>Are mocked for valiant ignorance</p>

<p>And perish constant fools. Who is ’t can blame him?</p>

<p>Your enemies and his find something in him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  We are all undone, unless</p>

<p>The noble man have mercy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  Who shall ask it?</p>

<p>The Tribunes cannot do ’t for shame; the people</p>

<p>Deserve such pity of him as the wolf</p>

<p>Does of the shepherds. For his best friends, if they</p>

<p>Should say “Be good to Rome,” they charged him</p>

<p>even</p>

<p>As those should do that had deserved his hate</p>

<p>And therein showed like enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  ’Tis true.</p>

<p>If he were putting to my house the brand</p>

<p>That should consume it, I have not the face</p>

<p>To say “Beseech you, cease.”–You have made fair</p>

<p>hands,</p>

<p>You and your crafts! You have crafted fair!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  You have</p>

<p>brought</p>

<p>A trembling upon Rome such as was never</p>

<p>S’ incapable of help.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tribunes</sc>  Say not we brought it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>How? Was ’t we? We loved him, but like beasts</p>

<p>And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,</p>

<p>Who did hoot him out o’ th’ city.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  But I fear</p>

<p>They’ll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,</p>

<p>The second name of men, obeys his points</p>

<p>As if he were his officer. Desperation</p>

<p>Is all the policy, strength, and defense</p>

<p>That Rome can make against them.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a troop of Citizens.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Here come the</p>

<p>clusters.–</p>

<p>And is Aufidius with him? You are they</p>

<p>That made the air unwholesome when you cast</p>

<p>Your stinking, greasy caps in hooting at</p>

<p>Coriolanus’ exile. Now he’s coming,</p>

<p>And not a hair upon a soldier’s head</p>

<p>Which will not prove a whip. As many coxcombs</p>

<p>As you threw caps up will he tumble down</p>

<p>And pay you for your voices. ’Tis no matter.</p>

<p>If he could burn us all into one coal,</p>

<p>We have deserved it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Citizens</sc>  Faith, we hear fearful news.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  For mine own part,</p>

<p>When I said banish him, I said ’twas pity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  And so did I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  And so did I. And, to say the truth, so</p>

<p>did very many of us. That we did we did for the</p>

<p>best; and though we willingly consented to his</p>

<p>banishment, yet it was against our will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  You’re goodly things, you voices!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>You have made good work, you and your cry!–</p>

<p>Shall ’s to the Capitol?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  O, ay, what else?     <i><i>[Both exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>Go, masters, get you home. Be not dismayed.</p>

<p>These are a side that would be glad to have</p>

<p>This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,</p>

<p>And show no sign of fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  The gods be good to us! Come, masters,</p>

<p>let’s home. I ever said we were i’ th’ wrong when</p>

<p>we banished him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  So did we all. But, come, let’s home.</p>

<p><center><i>[Citizens exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  I do not like this news.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Nor I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Let’s to the Capitol. Would half my wealth</p>

<p>Would buy this for a lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Pray, let’s go.</p>
