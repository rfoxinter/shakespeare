<p><center><i>[Enter Tullus Aufidius with Senators of Corioles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>So, your opinion is, Aufidius,</p>

<p>That they of Rome are entered in our counsels</p>

<p>And know how we proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  Is it not yours?</p>

<p>Whatever have been thought on in this state</p>

<p>That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome</p>

<p>Had circumvention? ’Tis not four days gone</p>

<p>Since I heard thence. These are the words–I think</p>

<p>I have the letter here. Yes, here it is.</p>

<p><i>[(He reads.)]</i> They have pressed a power, but it is not</p>

<p>known</p>

<p>Whether for east or west. The dearth is great.</p>

<p>The people mutinous; and, it is rumored,</p>

<p>Cominius, Martius your old enemy,</p>

<p>Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,</p>

<p>And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,</p>

<p>These three lead on this preparation</p>

<p>Whither ’tis bent. Most likely ’tis for you.</p>

<p>Consider of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Our army’s in the field.</p>

<p>We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready</p>

<p>To answer us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  Nor did you think it folly</p>

<p>To keep your great pretenses veiled till when</p>

<p>They needs must show themselves, which, in the</p>

<p>hatching,</p>

<p>It seemed, appeared to Rome. By the discovery</p>

<p>We shall be shortened in our aim, which was</p>

<p>To take in many towns ere almost Rome</p>

<p>Should know we were afoot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Noble Aufidius,</p>

<p>Take your commission; hie you to your bands.</p>

<p>Let us alone to guard Corioles.</p>

<p>If they set down before ’s, for the remove</p>

<p>Bring up your army. But I think you’ll find</p>

<p>They’ve not prepared for us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  O, doubt not that;</p>

<p>I speak from certainties. Nay, more,</p>

<p>Some parcels of their power are forth already,</p>

<p>And only hitherward. I leave your Honors.</p>

<p>If we and Caius Martius chance to meet,</p>

<p>’Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike</p>

<p>Till one can do no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  The gods assist you!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  And keep your Honors safe!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Farewell.</p>
