<p><center><i>[Enter a company of mutinous Citizens with staves,</p>

<p>clubs, and other weapons.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Before we proceed any further, hear me</p>

<p>speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Speak, speak!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  You are all resolved rather to die than to</p>

<p>famish?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Resolved, resolved!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  First, you know Caius Martius is chief</p>

<p>enemy to the people.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  We know ’t, we know ’t!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Let us kill him, and we’ll have corn at</p>

<p>our own price. Is ’t a verdict?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  No more talking on ’t; let it be done. Away, away!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  One word, good citizens.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians</p>

<p>good. What authority surfeits on would</p>

<p>relieve us. If they would yield us but the superfluity</p>

<p>while it were wholesome, we might guess they</p>

<p>relieved us humanely. But they think we are too</p>

<p>dear. The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our</p>

<p>misery, is as an inventory to particularize their</p>

<p>abundance; our sufferance is a gain to them. Let</p>

<p>us revenge this with our pikes ere we become</p>

<p>rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for</p>

<p>bread, not in thirst for revenge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Would you proceed especially against</p>

<p>Caius Martius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Against him first. He’s a very dog to the</p>

<p>commonalty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Consider you what services he has</p>

<p>done for his country?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Very well, and could be content to give</p>

<p>him good report for ’t, but that he pays himself</p>

<p>with being proud.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Nay, but speak not maliciously.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  I say unto you, what he hath done</p>

<p>famously he did it to that end. Though soft-conscienced</p>

<p>men can be content to say it was for</p>

<p>his country, he did it to please his mother and to be</p>

<p>partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of</p>

<p>his virtue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  What he cannot help in his nature you</p>

<p>account a vice in him. You must in no way say he</p>

<p>is covetous.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations.</p>

<p>He hath faults, with surplus, to tire in</p>

<p>repetition. <i>[(Shouts within.)]</i> What shouts are these?</p>

<p>The other side o’ th’ city is risen. Why stay we prating</p>

<p>here? To th’ Capitol!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Come, come!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Menenius Agrippa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Soft, who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Worthy Menenius Agrippa, one that</p>

<p>hath always loved the people.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  He’s one honest enough. Would all the</p>

<p>rest were so!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>What work ’s, my countrymen, in hand? Where go</p>

<p>you</p>

<p>With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Our business is not unknown to th’</p>

<p>Senate. They have had inkling this fortnight what</p>

<p>we intend to do, which now we’ll show ’em in</p>

<p>deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths;</p>

<p>they shall know we have strong arms too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest</p>

<p>neighbors,</p>

<p>Will you undo yourselves?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>We cannot, sir; we are undone already.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>I tell you, friends, most charitable care</p>

<p>Have the patricians of you. For your wants,</p>

<p>Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well</p>

<p>Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them</p>

<p>Against the Roman state, whose course will on</p>

<p>The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs</p>

<p>Of more strong link asunder than can ever</p>

<p>Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,</p>

<p>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and</p>

<p>Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,</p>

<p>You are transported by calamity</p>

<p>Thither where more attends you, and you slander</p>

<p>The helms o’ th’ state, who care for you like fathers,</p>

<p>When you curse them as enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Care for us? True, indeed! They ne’er</p>

<p>cared for us yet. Suffer us to famish, and their</p>

<p>storehouses crammed with grain; make edicts for</p>

<p>usury to support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome</p>

<p>act established against the rich, and provide</p>

<p>more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain</p>

<p>the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will;</p>

<p>and there’s all the love they bear us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>Either you must confess yourselves wondrous</p>

<p>malicious</p>

<p>Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you</p>

<p>A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it,</p>

<p>But since it serves my purpose, I will venture</p>

<p>To stale ’t a little more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Well, I’ll hear it, sir; yet you must not</p>

<p>think to fob off our disgrace with a tale. But, an ’t</p>

<p>please you, deliver.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>There was a time when all the body’s members</p>

<p>Rebelled against the belly, thus accused it:</p>

<p>That only like a gulf it did remain</p>

<p>I’ th’ midst o’ th’ body, idle and unactive,</p>

<p>Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing</p>

<p>Like labor with the rest, where th’ other instruments</p>

<p>Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,</p>

<p>And, mutually participate, did minister</p>

<p>Unto the appetite and affection common</p>

<p>Of the whole body. The belly answered–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,</p>

<p>Which ne’er came from the lungs, but even thus–</p>

<p>For, look you, I may make the belly smile</p>

<p>As well as speak–it tauntingly replied</p>

<p>To th’ discontented members, the mutinous parts</p>

<p>That envied his receipt; even so most fitly</p>

<p>As you malign our senators for that</p>

<p>They are not such as you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Your belly’s answer–what?</p>

<p>The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,</p>

<p>The counselor heart, the arm our soldier,</p>

<p>Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,</p>

<p>With other muniments and petty helps</p>

<p>In this our fabric, if that they–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  What then?</p>

<p>’Fore me, this fellow speaks. What then? What then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Should by the cormorant belly be restrained,</p>

<p>Who is the sink o’ th’ body–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Well, what then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>The former agents, if they did complain,</p>

<p>What could the belly answer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  I will tell you,</p>

<p>If you’ll bestow a small–of what you have little–</p>

<p>Patience awhile, you’st hear the belly’s answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>You’re long about it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Note me this, good friend;</p>

<p>Your most grave belly was deliberate,</p>

<p>Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered:</p>

<p>“True is it, my incorporate friends,” quoth he,</p>

<p>“That I receive the general food at first</p>

<p>Which you do live upon; and fit it is,</p>

<p>Because I am the storehouse and the shop</p>

<p>Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,</p>

<p>I send it through the rivers of your blood</p>

<p>Even to the court, the heart, to th’ seat o’ th’ brain;</p>

<p>And, through the cranks and offices of man,</p>

<p>The strongest nerves and small inferior veins</p>

<p>From me receive that natural competency</p>

<p>Whereby they live. And though that all at once,</p>

<p>You, my good friends”–this says the belly, mark</p>

<p>me–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Ay, sir, well, well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  “Though all at once cannot</p>

<p>See what I do deliver out to each,</p>

<p>Yet I can make my audit up, that all</p>

<p>From me do back receive the flour of all,</p>

<p>And leave me but the bran.” What say you to ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>It was an answer. How apply you this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>The senators of Rome are this good belly,</p>

<p>And you the mutinous members. For examine</p>

<p>Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly</p>

<p>Touching the weal o’ th’ common, you shall find</p>

<p>No public benefit which you receive</p>

<p>But it proceeds or comes from them to you</p>

<p>And no way from yourselves. What do you think,</p>

<p>You, the great toe of this assembly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  I the great toe? Why the great toe?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>For that, being one o’ th’ lowest, basest, poorest,</p>

<p>Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost.</p>

<p>Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,</p>

<p>Lead’st first to win some vantage.</p>

<p>But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.</p>

<p>Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;</p>

<p>The one side must have bale.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Caius Martius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Hail, noble Martius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Martius</sc></p>

<p>Thanks.–What’s the matter, you dissentious rogues,</p>

<p>That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,</p>

<p>Make yourselves scabs?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  We have ever your good word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Martius</sc></p>

<p>He that will give good words to thee will flatter</p>

<p>Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,</p>

<p>That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you;</p>

<p>The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,</p>

<p>Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;</p>

<p>Where foxes, geese. You are no surer, no,</p>

<p>Than is the coal of fire upon the ice</p>

<p>Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is</p>

<p>To make him worthy whose offense subdues him,</p>

<p>And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness</p>

<p>Deserves your hate; and your affections are</p>

<p>A sick man’s appetite, who desires most that</p>

<p>Which would increase his evil. He that depends</p>

<p>Upon your favors swims with fins of lead,</p>

<p>And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang you! Trust</p>

<p>you?</p>

<p>With every minute you do change a mind</p>

<p>And call him noble that was now your hate,</p>

<p>Him vile that was your garland. What’s the matter,</p>

<p>That in these several places of the city</p>

<p>You cry against the noble senate, who,</p>

<p>Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else</p>

<p>Would feed on one another?–What’s their seeking?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>For corn at their own rates, whereof they say</p>

<p>The city is well stored.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Martius</sc>  Hang ’em! They say?</p>

<p>They’ll sit by th’ fire and presume to know</p>

<p>What’s done i’ th’ Capitol, who’s like to rise,</p>

<p>Who thrives, and who declines; side factions and</p>

<p>give out</p>

<p>Conjectural marriages, making parties strong</p>

<p>And feebling such as stand not in their liking</p>

<p>Below their cobbled shoes. They say there’s grain</p>

<p>enough?</p>

<p>Would the nobility lay aside their ruth</p>

<p>And let me use my sword, I’d make a quarry</p>

<p>With thousands of these quartered slaves as high</p>

<p>As I could pick my lance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;</p>

<p>For though abundantly they lack discretion,</p>

<p>Yet are they passing cowardly. But I beseech you,</p>

<p>What says the other troop?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Martius</sc>  They are dissolved. Hang</p>

<p>’em!</p>

<p>They said they were an-hungry, sighed forth</p>

<p>proverbs</p>

<p>That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,</p>

<p>That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent</p>

<p>not</p>

<p>Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds</p>

<p>They vented their complainings, which being</p>

<p>answered</p>

<p>And a petition granted them–a strange one,</p>

<p>To break the heart of generosity</p>

<p>And make bold power look pale–they threw their</p>

<p>caps</p>

<p>As they would hang them on the horns o’ th’ moon,</p>

<p>Shouting their emulation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  What is granted them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Martius</sc></p>

<p>Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,</p>

<p>Of their own choice. One’s Junius Brutus,</p>

<p>Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. ’Sdeath!</p>

<p>The rabble should have first unroofed the city</p>

<p>Ere so prevailed with me. It will in time</p>

<p>Win upon power and throw forth greater themes</p>

<p>For insurrection’s arguing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  This is strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Martius</sc>  Go get you home, you fragments.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger hastily.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Where’s Caius Martius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Martius</sc>  Here. What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Martius</sc></p>

<p>I am glad on ’t. Then we shall ha’ means to vent</p>

<p>Our musty superfluity.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sicinius Velutus, Junius Brutus, (two Tribunes);</p>

<p>Cominius, Titus Lartius, with other Senators.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>See our best elders.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>Martius, ’tis true that you have lately told us:</p>

<p>The Volsces are in arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Martius</sc>  They have a leader,</p>

<p>Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to ’t.</p>

<p>I sin in envying his nobility,</p>

<p>And, were I anything but what I am,</p>

<p>I would wish me only he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  You have fought together?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Martius</sc></p>

<p>Were half to half the world by th’ ears and he</p>

<p>Upon my party, I’d revolt, to make</p>

<p>Only my wars with him. He is a lion</p>

<p>That I am proud to hunt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Then, worthy Martius,</p>

<p>Attend upon Cominius to these wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc></p>

<p>It is your former promise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Martius</sc>  Sir, it is,</p>

<p>And I am constant.–Titus Lartius, thou</p>

<p>Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus’ face.</p>

<p>What, art thou stiff? Stand’st out?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lartius</sc>  No, Caius Martius,</p>

<p>I’ll lean upon one crutch and fight with t’ other</p>

<p>Ere stay behind this business.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  O, true bred!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>Your company to th’ Capitol, where I know</p>

<p>Our greatest friends attend us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lartius</sc> <i>[to Cominius]</i>  Lead you on.–</p>

<p><i>[To Martius.]</i> Follow Cominius. We must follow you;</p>

<p>Right worthy you priority.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  Noble Martius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc> <i>[to the Citizens]</i></p>

<p>Hence to your homes, begone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Martius</sc>  Nay, let them follow.</p>

<p>The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither</p>

<p>To gnaw their garners.</p>

<p><center><i>[Citizens steal away.]</i></center></p>

<p>Worshipful mutineers,</p>

<p>Your valor puts well forth.–Pray follow.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit. Sicinius and Brutus remain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>Was ever man so proud as is this Martius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  He has no equal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>When we were chosen tribunes for the people–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Marked you his lip and eyes?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Nay, but his taunts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Bemock the modest moon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>The present wars devour him! He is grown</p>

<p>Too proud to be so valiant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Such a nature,</p>

<p>Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow</p>

<p>Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder</p>

<p>His insolence can brook to be commanded</p>

<p>Under Cominius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Fame, at the which he aims,</p>

<p>In whom already he’s well graced, cannot</p>

<p>Better be held nor more attained than by</p>

<p>A place below the first; for what miscarries</p>

<p>Shall be the General’s fault, though he perform</p>

<p>To th’ utmost of a man, and giddy censure</p>

<p>Will then cry out of Martius “O, if he</p>

<p>Had borne the business!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Besides, if things go well,</p>

<p>Opinion that so sticks on Martius shall</p>

<p>Of his demerits rob Cominius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Come.</p>

<p>Half all Cominius’ honors are to Martius,</p>

<p>Though Martius earned them not, and all his faults</p>

<p>To Martius shall be honors, though indeed</p>

<p>In aught he merit not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Let’s hence and hear</p>

<p>How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,</p>

<p>More than his singularity, he goes</p>

<p>Upon this present action.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Let’s along.</p>
