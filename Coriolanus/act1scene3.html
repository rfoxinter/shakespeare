<p><center><i>[Enter Volumnia and Virgilia, mother and wife</p>

<p>to Martius. They set them down on two low stools</p>

<p>and sew.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself</p>

<p>in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my</p>

<p>husband, I should freelier rejoice in that absence</p>

<p>wherein he won honor than in the embracements</p>

<p>of his bed where he would show most love. When</p>

<p>yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of</p>

<p>my womb, when youth with comeliness plucked</p>

<p>all gaze his way, when for a day of kings’ entreaties</p>

<p>a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding,</p>

<p>I, considering how honor would become</p>

<p>such a person–that it was no better than picture-like</p>

<p>to hang by th’ wall, if renown made it not</p>

<p>stir–was pleased to let him seek danger where he</p>

<p>was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him,</p>

<p>from whence he returned, his brows bound with</p>

<p>oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy</p>

<p>at first hearing he was a man-child than now in</p>

<p>first seeing he had proved himself a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  But had he died in the business, madam, how</p>

<p>then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Then his good report should have been my</p>

<p>son; I therein would have found issue. Hear me</p>

<p>profess sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my</p>

<p>love alike and none less dear than thine and my</p>

<p>good Martius, I had rather had eleven die nobly</p>

<p>for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out</p>

<p>of action.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Gentlewoman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentlewoman</span>  Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to</p>

<p>visit you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span></p>

<p>Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Indeed you shall not.</p>

<p>Methinks I hear hither your husband’s drum,</p>

<p>See him pluck Aufidius down by th’ hair;</p>

<p>As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.</p>

<p>Methinks I see him stamp thus and call thus:</p>

<p>“Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear,</p>

<p>Though you were born in Rome.” His bloody brow</p>

<p>With his mailed hand then wiping, forth he goes</p>

<p>Like to a harvestman that’s tasked to mow</p>

<p>Or all or lose his hire.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span></p>

<p>His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>Away, you fool! It more becomes a man</p>

<p>Than gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba,</p>

<p>When she did suckle Hector, looked not lovelier</p>

<p>Than Hector’s forehead when it spit forth blood</p>

<p>At Grecian sword, contemning.–Tell Valeria</p>

<p>We are fit to bid her welcome.     <i><i>[Gentlewoman exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span></p>

<p>Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>He’ll beat Aufidius’ head below his knee</p>

<p>And tread upon his neck.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Valeria with an Usher and a Gentlewoman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  My ladies both, good day to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Sweet madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  I am glad to see your Ladyship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  How do you both? You are manifest housekeepers.</p>

<p>What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in</p>

<p>good faith. How does your little son?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  I thank your Ladyship; well, good madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  He had rather see the swords and hear a</p>

<p>drum than look upon his schoolmaster.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  O’ my word, the father’s son! I’ll swear ’tis a</p>

<p>very pretty boy. O’ my troth, I looked upon him o’</p>

<p>Wednesday half an hour together. H’as such a confirmed</p>

<p>countenance. I saw him run after a gilded</p>

<p>butterfly, and when he caught it, he let it go again,</p>

<p>and after it again, and over and over he comes,</p>

<p>and up again, catched it again. Or whether his fall</p>

<p>enraged him or how ’twas, he did so set his teeth</p>

<p>and tear it. O, I warrant how he mammocked it!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  One on ’s father’s moods.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  Indeed, la, ’tis a noble child.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  A crack, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  Come, lay aside your stitchery. I must have</p>

<p>you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  No, good madam, I will not out of doors.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  Not out of doors?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  She shall, she shall.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  Indeed, no, by your patience. I’ll not over the</p>

<p>threshold till my lord return from the wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.</p>

<p>Come, you must go visit the good lady that lies in.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  I will wish her speedy strength and visit her</p>

<p>with my prayers, but I cannot go thither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Why, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  ’Tis not to save labor, nor that I want love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  You would be another Penelope. Yet they say</p>

<p>all the yarn she spun in Ulysses’ absence did but fill</p>

<p>Ithaca full of moths. Come, I would your cambric</p>

<p>were sensible as your finger, that you might leave</p>

<p>pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will</p>

<p>not forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  In truth, la, go with me, and I’ll tell you excellent</p>

<p>news of your husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  O, good madam, there can be none yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  Verily, I do not jest with you. There came</p>

<p>news from him last night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  Indeed, madam!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  In earnest, it’s true. I heard a senator speak it.</p>

<p>Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth, against</p>

<p>whom Cominius the General is gone with one</p>

<p>part of our Roman power. Your lord and Titus Lartius</p>

<p>are set down before their city Corioles. They</p>

<p>nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief</p>

<p>wars. This is true, on mine honor, and so, I pray, go</p>

<p>with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  Give me excuse, good madam. I will obey you</p>

<p>in everything hereafter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Let her alone, lady. As she is now, she will</p>

<p>but disease our better mirth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  In troth, I think she would.–Fare you well,</p>

<p>then.–Come, good sweet lady.–Prithee, Virgilia,</p>

<p>turn thy solemness out o’ door, and go along with</p>

<p>us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  No, at a word, madam. Indeed, I must not. I</p>

<p>wish you much mirth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Valeria</span>  Well, then, farewell.</p>
