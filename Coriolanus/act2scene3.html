<p><center><i>[Enter seven or eight Citizens.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Once, if he do require our voices, we</p>

<p>ought not to deny him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  We may, sir, if we will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  We have power in ourselves to do it, but</p>

<p>it is a power that we have no power to do; for, if</p>

<p>he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds, we</p>

<p>are to put our tongues into those wounds and</p>

<p>speak for them. So, if he tell us his noble deeds, we</p>

<p>must also tell him our noble acceptance of them.</p>

<p>Ingratitude is monstrous, and for the multitude to</p>

<p>be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude,</p>

<p>of the which, we being members, should</p>

<p>bring ourselves to be monstrous members.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  And to make us no better thought of, a</p>

<p>little help will serve; for once we stood up about</p>

<p>the corn, he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed</p>

<p>multitude.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  We have been called so of many; not that</p>

<p>our heads are some brown, some black, some</p>

<p>abram, some bald, but that our wits are so diversely</p>

<p>colored; and truly I think if all our wits were to</p>

<p>issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west,</p>

<p>north, south, and their consent of one direct way</p>

<p>should be at once to all the points o’ th’ compass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Think you so? Which way do you</p>

<p>judge my wit would fly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another</p>

<p>man’s will; ’tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead.</p>

<p>But if it were at liberty, ’twould sure</p>

<p>southward.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Why that way?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  To lose itself in a fog, where, being three</p>

<p>parts melted away with rotten dews, the fourth</p>

<p>would return for conscience’ sake, to help to get</p>

<p>thee a wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  You are never without your tricks. You</p>

<p>may, you may.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Are you all resolved to give your voices?</p>

<p>But that’s no matter; the greater part carries it. I</p>

<p>say, if he would incline to the people, there was</p>

<p>never a worthier man.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Coriolanus in a gown of humility, with Menenius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here he comes, and in the gown of humility. Mark</p>

<p>his behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to</p>

<p>come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos,</p>

<p>and by threes. He’s to make his requests by particulars,</p>

<p>wherein every one of us has a single honor</p>

<p>in giving him our own voices with our own tongues.</p>

<p>Therefore follow me, and I’ll direct you how you</p>

<p>shall go by him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Content, content.     <i><i>[Citizens exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>O sir, you are not right. Have you not known</p>

<p>The worthiest men have done ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  What must I say?</p>

<p>“I pray, sir?”–plague upon ’t! I cannot bring</p>

<p>My tongue to such a pace. “Look, sir, my wounds!</p>

<p>I got them in my country’s service when</p>

<p>Some certain of your brethren roared and ran</p>

<p>From th’ noise of our own drums.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  O me, the gods!</p>

<p>You must not speak of that. You must desire them</p>

<p>To think upon you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Think upon me? Hang ’em!</p>

<p>I would they would forget me, like the virtues</p>

<p>Which our divines lose by ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  You’ll mar all.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you. Pray you, speak to ’em, I pray you,</p>

<p>In wholesome manner.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Bid them wash their faces</p>

<p>And keep their teeth clean.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter three of the Citizens.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>So, here comes a brace.–</p>

<p>You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>We do, sir. Tell us what hath brought you to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Mine own desert.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Your own desert?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Ay, but not mine own desire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  How, not your own desire?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  No, sir, ’twas never my desire yet to trouble</p>

<p>the poor with begging.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  You must think if we give you anything,</p>

<p>we hope to gain by you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Well then, I pray, your price o’ th’</p>

<p>consulship?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  The price is to ask it kindly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Kindly, sir, I pray, let me ha ’t. I have</p>

<p>wounds to show you, which shall be yours in</p>

<p>private.–Your good voice, sir. What say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  You shall ha ’t, worthy sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  A match, sir. There’s in all two worthy</p>

<p>voices begged. I have your alms. Adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc> <i>[to the other Citizens]</i>  But this is something</p>

<p>odd.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  An ’twere to give again–but ’tis no</p>

<p>matter.     <i><i>[These citizens exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter two other Citizens.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Pray you now, if it may stand with the</p>

<p>tune of your voices that I may be consul, I have</p>

<p>here the customary gown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  You have deserved nobly of your</p>

<p>country, and you have not deserved nobly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Your enigma?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  You have been a scourge to her enemies;</p>

<p>you have been a rod to her friends. You have</p>

<p>not indeed loved the common people.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  You should account me the more virtuous</p>

<p>that I have not been common in my love. I will, sir,</p>

<p>flatter my sworn brother, the people, to earn a</p>

<p>dearer estimation of them; ’tis a condition they account</p>

<p>gentle. And since the wisdom of their choice</p>

<p>is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practice</p>

<p>the insinuating nod and be off to them most</p>

<p>counterfeitly. That is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment</p>

<p>of some popular man and give it bountiful</p>

<p>to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you, I may</p>

<p>be consul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fifth</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  We hope to find you our friend, and</p>

<p>therefore give you our voices heartily.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  You have received many wounds for</p>

<p>your country.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  I will not seal your knowledge with showing</p>

<p>them. I will make much of your voices and so</p>

<p>trouble you no farther.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>  The gods give you joy, sir, heartily.</p>

<p><center><i>[Citizens exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Most sweet voices!</p>

<p>Better it is to die, better to starve,</p>

<p>Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.</p>

<p>Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here</p>

<p>To beg of Hob and Dick that does appear</p>

<p>Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to ’t.</p>

<p>What custom wills, in all things should we do ’t?</p>

<p>The dust on antique time would lie unswept</p>

<p>And mountainous error be too highly heaped</p>

<p>For truth to o’erpeer. Rather than fool it so,</p>

<p>Let the high office and the honor go</p>

<p>To one that would do thus. I am half through;</p>

<p>The one part suffered, the other will I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter three Citizens more.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here come more voices.–</p>

<p>Your voices! For your voices I have fought;</p>

<p>Watched for your voices; for your voices bear</p>

<p>Of wounds two dozen odd. Battles thrice six</p>

<p>I have seen and heard of; for your voices have</p>

<p>Done many things, some less, some more. Your</p>

<p>voices!</p>

<p>Indeed, I would be consul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sixth</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  He has done nobly, and cannot go</p>

<p>without any honest man’s voice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seventh</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  Therefore let him be consul. The</p>

<p>gods give him joy, and make him good friend to</p>

<p>the people!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul.</p>

<p><center><i>[Citizens exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Worthy voices!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Menenius, with Brutus and Sicinius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>You have stood your limitation, and the Tribunes</p>

<p>Endue you with the people’s voice. Remains</p>

<p>That in th’ official marks invested, you</p>

<p>Anon do meet the Senate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Is this done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>The custom of request you have discharged.</p>

<p>The people do admit you, and are summoned</p>

<p>To meet anon upon your approbation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>Where? At the Senate House?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  There, Coriolanus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>May I change these garments?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  You may, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>That I’ll straight do and, knowing myself again,</p>

<p>Repair to th’ Senate House.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>I’ll keep you company.–Will you along?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>We stay here for the people.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Fare you well.</p>

<p><center><i>[Coriolanus and Menenius exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>He has it now; and by his looks, methinks,</p>

<p>’Tis warm at ’s heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  With a proud heart he wore</p>

<p>His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Plebeians.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>How now, my masters, have you chose this man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  He has our voices, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,</p>

<p>He mocked us when he begged our voices.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Certainly, he flouted us downright.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>No, ’tis his kind of speech. He did not mock us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says</p>

<p>He used us scornfully. He should have showed us</p>

<p>His marks of merit, wounds received for ’s country.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Why, so he did, I am sure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  No, no. No man saw ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>He said he had wounds, which he could show in</p>

<p>private,</p>

<p>And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,</p>

<p>“I would be consul,” says he. “Aged custom,</p>

<p>But by your voices, will not so permit me;</p>

<p>Your voices therefore.” When we granted that,</p>

<p>Here was “I thank you for your voices. Thank you.</p>

<p>Your most sweet voices! Now you have left your</p>

<p>voices,</p>

<p>I have no further with you.” Was not this mockery?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>Why either were you ignorant to see ’t</p>

<p>Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness</p>

<p>To yield your voices?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Could you not have told him</p>

<p>As you were lessoned? When he had no power,</p>

<p>But was a petty servant to the state,</p>

<p>He was your enemy, ever spake against</p>

<p>Your liberties and the charters that you bear</p>

<p>I’ th’ body of the weal; and, now arriving</p>

<p>A place of potency and sway o’ th’ state,</p>

<p>If he should still malignantly remain</p>

<p>Fast foe to th’ plebeii, your voices might</p>

<p>Be curses to yourselves. You should have said</p>

<p>That as his worthy deeds did claim no less</p>

<p>Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature</p>

<p>Would think upon you for your voices, and</p>

<p>Translate his malice towards you into love,</p>

<p>Standing your friendly lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Thus to have said,</p>

<p>As you were fore-advised, had touched his spirit</p>

<p>And tried his inclination; from him plucked</p>

<p>Either his gracious promise, which you might,</p>

<p>As cause had called you up, have held him to;</p>

<p>Or else it would have galled his surly nature,</p>

<p>Which easily endures not article</p>

<p>Tying him to aught. So putting him to rage,</p>

<p>You should have ta’en th’ advantage of his choler</p>

<p>And passed him unelected.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Did you perceive</p>

<p>He did solicit you in free contempt</p>

<p>When he did need your loves, and do you think</p>

<p>That his contempt shall not be bruising to you</p>

<p>When he hath power to crush? Why, had your</p>

<p>bodies</p>

<p>No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry</p>

<p>Against the rectorship of judgment?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>Have you ere now denied the asker? And now</p>

<p>Again, of him that did not ask but mock,</p>

<p>Bestow your sued-for tongues?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  He’s not confirmed.</p>

<p>We may deny him yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  And will deny him.</p>

<p>I’ll have five hundred voices of that sound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends</p>

<p>They have chose a consul that will from them take</p>

<p>Their liberties, make them of no more voice</p>

<p>Than dogs that are as often beat for barking</p>

<p>As therefor kept to do so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Let them assemble</p>

<p>And, on a safer judgment, all revoke</p>

<p>Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride</p>

<p>And his old hate unto you. Besides, forget not</p>

<p>With what contempt he wore the humble weed,</p>

<p>How in his suit he scorned you; but your loves,</p>

<p>Thinking upon his services, took from you</p>

<p>Th’ apprehension of his present portance,</p>

<p>Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion</p>

<p>After the inveterate hate he bears you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Lay</p>

<p>A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labored,</p>

<p>No impediment between, but that you must</p>

<p>Cast your election on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Say you chose him</p>

<p>More after our commandment than as guided</p>

<p>By your own true affections, and that your minds,</p>

<p>Preoccupied with what you rather must do</p>

<p>Than what you should, made you against the grain</p>

<p>To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,</p>

<p>How youngly he began to serve his country,</p>

<p>How long continued, and what stock he springs of,</p>

<p>The noble house o’ th’ Martians, from whence came</p>

<p>That Ancus Martius, Numa’s daughter’s son,</p>

<p>Who after great Hostilius here was king,</p>

<p>Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,</p>

<p>That our best water brought by conduits hither;</p>

<p>And Censorinus, that was so surnamed,</p>

<p>And nobly named so, twice being censor,</p>

<p>Was his great ancestor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  One thus descended,</p>

<p>That hath besides well in his person wrought</p>

<p>To be set high in place, we did commend</p>

<p>To your remembrances; but you have found,</p>

<p>Scaling his present bearing with his past,</p>

<p>That he’s your fixed enemy, and revoke</p>

<p>Your sudden approbation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Say you ne’er had done ’t–</p>

<p>Harp on that still–but by our putting on.</p>

<p>And presently, when you have drawn your number,</p>

<p>Repair to th’ Capitol.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  We will so. Almost all</p>

<p>Repent in their election.     <i><i>[Plebeians exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Let them go on.</p>

<p>This mutiny were better put in hazard</p>

<p>Than stay, past doubt, for greater.</p>

<p>If, as his nature is, he fall in rage</p>

<p>With their refusal, both observe and answer</p>

<p>The vantage of his anger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  To th’ Capitol, come.</p>

<p>We will be there before the stream o’ th’ people,</p>

<p>And this shall seem, as partly ’tis, their own,</p>

<p>Which we have goaded onward.</p>
