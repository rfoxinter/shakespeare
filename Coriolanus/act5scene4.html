<p><center><i>[Enter Menenius and Sicinius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  See you yond coign o’ th’ Capitol, yond</p>

<p>cornerstone?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Why, what of that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  If it be possible for you to displace it with</p>

<p>your little finger, there is some hope the ladies of</p>

<p>Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with</p>

<p>him. But I say there is no hope in ’t. Our throats</p>

<p>are sentenced and stay upon execution.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Is ’t possible that so short a time can alter the</p>

<p>condition of a man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  There is differency between a grub and a</p>

<p>butterfly, yet your butterfly was a grub. This Martius</p>

<p>is grown from man to dragon. He has wings;</p>

<p>he’s more than a creeping thing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  He loved his mother dearly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  So did he me; and he no more remembers</p>

<p>his mother now than an eight-year-old horse. The</p>

<p>tartness of his face sours ripe grapes. When he</p>

<p>walks, he moves like an engine, and the ground</p>

<p>shrinks before his treading. He is able to pierce a</p>

<p>corslet with his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum</p>

<p>is a battery. He sits in his state as a thing made for</p>

<p>Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with</p>

<p>his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity</p>

<p>and a heaven to throne in.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  I paint him in the character. Mark what</p>

<p>mercy his mother shall bring from him. There is</p>

<p>no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male</p>

<p>tiger. That shall our poor city find, and all this is</p>

<p>long of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  The gods be good unto us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  No, in such a case the gods will not be good</p>

<p>unto us. When we banished him, we respected not</p>

<p>them; and he returning to break our necks, they</p>

<p>respect not us.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span> <i>[to Sicinius]</i></p>

<p>Sir, if you’d save your life, fly to your house.</p>

<p>The plebeians have got your fellow tribune</p>

<p>And hale him up and down, all swearing if</p>

<p>The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,</p>

<p>They’ll give him death by inches.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter another Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  What’s the news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Good news, good news! The ladies have prevailed.</p>

<p>The Volscians are dislodged and Martius gone.</p>

<p>A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,</p>

<p>No, not th’ expulsion of the Tarquins.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Friend,</p>

<p>Art thou certain this is true? Is ’t most certain?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>As certain as I know the sun is fire.</p>

<p>Where have you lurked that you make doubt of it?</p>

<p>Ne’er through an arch so hurried the blown tide</p>

<p>As the recomforted through th’ gates. Why, hark you!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Trumpets, hautboys, drums beat, all together.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries, and fifes,</p>

<p>Tabors and cymbals, and the shouting Romans</p>

<p>Make the sun dance. Hark you!     <i><i>[A shout within.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  This is good news.</p>

<p>I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia</p>

<p>Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians</p>

<p>A city full; of tribunes such as you</p>

<p>A sea and land full. You have prayed well today.</p>

<p>This morning for ten thousand of your throats</p>

<p>I’d not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!</p>

<p><center><i>[Sound still with the shouts.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span> <i>[to Second Messenger]</i>  First, the gods bless</p>

<p>you for your tidings; next, accept my thankfulness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Sir, we have all great cause to give great thanks.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  They are near the city?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Almost at point to enter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  We’ll meet them, and help the joy.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
