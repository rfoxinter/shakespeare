<p><center><i>[Enter Coriolanus and Aufidius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow</p>

<p>Set down our host. My partner in this action,</p>

<p>You must report to th’ Volscian lords how plainly</p>

<p>I have borne this business.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span>  Only their ends</p>

<p>You have respected, stopped your ears against</p>

<p>The general suit of Rome, never admitted</p>

<p>A private whisper, no, not with such friends</p>

<p>That thought them sure of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  This last old man,</p>

<p>Whom with a cracked heart I have sent to Rome,</p>

<p>Loved me above the measure of a father,</p>

<p>Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge</p>

<p>Was to send him, for whose old love I have–</p>

<p>Though I showed sourly to him–once more offered</p>

<p>The first conditions, which they did refuse</p>

<p>And cannot now accept, to grace him only</p>

<p>That thought he could do more. A very little</p>

<p>I have yielded to. Fresh embassies and suits,</p>

<p>Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter</p>

<p>Will I lend ear to.     <i><i>[Shout within.]</i></i></p>

<p>Ha? What shout is this?</p>

<p>Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow</p>

<p>In the same time ’tis made? I will not.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Virgilia, Volumnia, Valeria, young Martius,</p>

<p>with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>My wife comes foremost, then the honored mold</p>

<p>Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand</p>

<p>The grandchild to her blood. But out, affection!</p>

<p>All bond and privilege of nature, break!</p>

<p>Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.     <i><i>[Virgilia curtsies.]</i></i></p>

<p>What is that curtsy worth? Or those doves’ eyes,</p>

<p>Which can make gods forsworn? I melt and am not</p>

<p>Of stronger earth than others.     <i><i>[Volumnia bows.]</i></i></p>

<p>My mother bows,</p>

<p>As if Olympus to a molehill should</p>

<p>In supplication nod; and my young boy</p>

<p>Hath an aspect of intercession which</p>

<p>Great Nature cries “Deny not!” Let the Volsces</p>

<p>Plow Rome and harrow Italy, I’ll never</p>

<p>Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand</p>

<p>As if a man were author of himself,</p>

<p>And knew no other kin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  My lord and husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span></p>

<p>The sorrow that delivers us thus changed</p>

<p>Makes you think so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Like a dull actor now,</p>

<p>I have forgot my part, and I am out,</p>

<p>Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,</p>

<p>Forgive my tyranny, but do not say</p>

<p>For that “Forgive our Romans.”     <i><i>[They kiss.]</i></i></p>

<p>O, a kiss</p>

<p>Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!</p>

<p>Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss</p>

<p>I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip</p>

<p>Hath virgined it e’er since. You gods! I prate</p>

<p>And the most noble mother of the world</p>

<p>Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, i’ th’ earth;     <i><i>[Kneels.]</i></i></p>

<p>Of thy deep duty more impression show</p>

<p>Than that of common sons.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  O, stand up blest,</p>

<p><center><i>[He rises.]</i></center></p>

<p>Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint</p>

<p>I kneel before thee and unproperly</p>

<p>Show duty, as mistaken all this while</p>

<p>Between the child and parent.     <i><i>[She kneels.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  What’s this?</p>

<p>Your knees to me? To your corrected son?</p>

<p><center><i>[He raises her up.]</i></center></p>

<p>Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach</p>

<p>Fillip the stars! Then let the mutinous winds</p>

<p>Strike the proud cedars ’gainst the fiery sun,</p>

<p>Murdering impossibility to make</p>

<p>What cannot be slight work.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Thou art my warrior;</p>

<p>I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>The noble sister of Publicola,</p>

<p>The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle</p>

<p>That’s curdied by the frost from purest snow</p>

<p>And hangs on Dian’s temple!–Dear Valeria.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span> <i>[presenting young Martius]</i></p>

<p>This is a poor epitome of yours,</p>

<p>Which by th’ interpretation of full time</p>

<p>May show like all yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span> <i>[to young Martius]</i>  The god of soldiers,</p>

<p>With the consent of supreme Jove, inform</p>

<p>Thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou mayst prove</p>

<p>To shame unvulnerable, and stick i’ th’ wars</p>

<p>Like a great seamark standing every flaw</p>

<p>And saving those that eye thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span> <i>[to young Martius]</i>  Your knee, sirrah.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kneels.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  That’s my brave boy!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself</p>

<p>Are suitors to you.     <i><i>[Young Martius rises.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  I beseech you, peace;</p>

<p>Or if you’d ask, remember this before:</p>

<p>The thing I have forsworn to grant may never</p>

<p>Be held by you denials. Do not bid me</p>

<p>Dismiss my soldiers or capitulate</p>

<p>Again with Rome’s mechanics. Tell me not</p>

<p>Wherein I seem unnatural; desire not</p>

<p>T’ allay my rages and revenges with</p>

<p>Your colder reasons.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  O, no more, no more!</p>

<p>You have said you will not grant us anything;</p>

<p>For we have nothing else to ask but that</p>

<p>Which you deny already. Yet we will ask,</p>

<p>That if you fail in our request, the blame</p>

<p>May hang upon your hardness. Therefore hear us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark, for we’ll</p>

<p>Hear naught from Rome in private. <i>[He sits.]</i> Your</p>

<p>request?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment</p>

<p>And state of bodies would bewray what life</p>

<p>We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself</p>

<p>How more unfortunate than all living women</p>

<p>Are we come hither; since that thy sight, which</p>

<p>should</p>

<p>Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with</p>

<p>comforts,</p>

<p>Constrains them weep and shake with fear and</p>

<p>sorrow,</p>

<p>Making the mother, wife, and child to see</p>

<p>The son, the husband, and the father tearing</p>

<p>His country’s bowels out. And to poor we</p>

<p>Thine enmity’s most capital. Thou barr’st us</p>

<p>Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort</p>

<p>That all but we enjoy. For how can we–</p>

<p>Alas, how can we–for our country pray,</p>

<p>Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,</p>

<p>Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose</p>

<p>The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,</p>

<p>Our comfort in the country. We must find</p>

<p>An evident calamity, though we had</p>

<p>Our wish, which side should win, for either thou</p>

<p>Must as a foreign recreant be led</p>

<p>With manacles through our streets, or else</p>

<p>Triumphantly tread on thy country’s ruin</p>

<p>And bear the palm for having bravely shed</p>

<p>Thy wife and children’s blood. For myself, son,</p>

<p>I purpose not to wait on fortune till</p>

<p>These wars determine. If I cannot persuade thee</p>

<p>Rather to show a noble grace to both parts</p>

<p>Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner</p>

<p>March to assault thy country than to tread–</p>

<p>Trust to ’t, thou shalt not–on thy mother’s womb</p>

<p>That brought thee to this world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  Ay, and mine,</p>

<p>That brought you forth this boy to keep your name</p>

<p>Living to time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Martius</span>  He shall not tread on me.</p>

<p>I’ll run away till I am bigger, but then I’ll fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>Not of a woman’s tenderness to be</p>

<p>Requires nor child nor woman’s face to see.–</p>

<p>I have sat too long.     <i><i>[He rises.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Nay, go not from us thus.</p>

<p>If it were so, that our request did tend</p>

<p>To save the Romans, thereby to destroy</p>

<p>The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn</p>

<p>us</p>

<p>As poisonous of your honor. No, our suit</p>

<p>Is that you reconcile them, while the Volsces</p>

<p>May say “This mercy we have showed,” the Romans</p>

<p>“This we received,” and each in either side</p>

<p>Give the all-hail to thee and cry “Be blest</p>

<p>For making up this peace!” Thou know’st, great son,</p>

<p>The end of war’s uncertain, but this certain,</p>

<p>That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit</p>

<p>Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name</p>

<p>Whose repetition will be dogged with curses,</p>

<p>Whose chronicle thus writ: “The man was noble,</p>

<p>But with his last attempt he wiped it out,</p>

<p>Destroyed his country, and his name remains</p>

<p>To th’ ensuing age abhorred.” Speak to me, son.</p>

<p>Thou hast affected the fine strains of honor</p>

<p>To imitate the graces of the gods,</p>

<p>To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o’ th’ air</p>

<p>And yet to charge thy sulfur with a bolt</p>

<p>That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?</p>

<p>Think’st thou it honorable for a noble man</p>

<p>Still to remember wrongs?–Daughter, speak you.</p>

<p>He cares not for your weeping.–Speak thou, boy.</p>

<p>Perhaps thy childishness will move him more</p>

<p>Than can our reasons.–There’s no man in the world</p>

<p>More bound to ’s mother, yet here he lets me prate</p>

<p>Like one i’ th’ stocks. Thou hast never in thy life</p>

<p>Showed thy dear mother any courtesy</p>

<p>When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,</p>

<p>Has clucked thee to the wars and safely home,</p>

<p>Loaden with honor. Say my request’s unjust</p>

<p>And spurn me back; but if it be not so,</p>

<p>Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee</p>

<p>That thou restrain’st from me the duty which</p>

<p>To a mother’s part belongs.–He turns away.–</p>

<p>Down, ladies! Let us shame him with our knees.</p>

<p>To his surname Coriolanus ’longs more pride</p>

<p>Than pity to our prayers. Down! An end.</p>

<p><center><i>[They kneel.]</i></center></p>

<p>This is the last. So, we will home to Rome</p>

<p>And die among our neighbors.–Nay, behold ’s.</p>

<p>This boy that cannot tell what he would have,</p>

<p>But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,</p>

<p>Does reason our petition with more strength</p>

<p>Than thou hast to deny ’t.–Come, let us go.</p>

<p><center><i>[They rise.]</i></center></p>

<p>This fellow had a Volscian to his mother,</p>

<p>His wife is in Corioles, and his child</p>

<p>Like him by chance.–Yet give us our dispatch.</p>

<p>I am hushed until our city be afire,</p>

<p>And then I’ll speak a little.</p>

<p><center><i>[He holds her by the hand, silent.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  O mother, mother!</p>

<p>What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,</p>

<p>The gods look down, and this unnatural scene</p>

<p>They laugh at. O, my mother, mother, O!</p>

<p>You have won a happy victory to Rome,</p>

<p>But, for your son–believe it, O, believe it!–</p>

<p>Most dangerously you have with him prevailed,</p>

<p>If not most mortal to him. But let it come.–</p>

<p>Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,</p>

<p>I’ll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,</p>

<p>Were you in my stead, would you have heard</p>

<p>A mother less? Or granted less, Aufidius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span></p>

<p>I was moved withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  I dare be sworn you were.</p>

<p>And, sir, it is no little thing to make</p>

<p>Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,</p>

<p>What peace you’ll make advise me. For my part,</p>

<p>I’ll not to Rome. I’ll back with you; and pray you,</p>

<p>Stand to me in this cause.–O mother!–Wife!</p>

<p><center><i>[He speaks with them aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honor</p>

<p>At difference in thee. Out of that I’ll work</p>

<p>Myself a former fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span> <i>[to the Women]</i>  Ay, by and by;</p>

<p>But we will drink together, and you shall bear</p>

<p>A better witness back than words, which we,</p>

<p>On like conditions, will have countersealed.</p>

<p>Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve</p>

<p>To have a temple built you. All the swords</p>

<p>In Italy, and her confederate arms,</p>

<p>Could not have made this peace.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
