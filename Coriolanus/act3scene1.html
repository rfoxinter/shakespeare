<p><center><i>[Cornets. Enter Coriolanus, Menenius, all the Gentry,</p>

<p>Cominius, Titus Lartius, and other Senators.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lartius</sc></p>

<p>He had, my lord, and that it was which caused</p>

<p>Our swifter composition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>So then the Volsces stand but as at first,</p>

<p>Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road</p>

<p>Upon ’s again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  They are worn, lord consul, so,</p>

<p>That we shall hardly in our ages see</p>

<p>Their banners wave again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Saw you Aufidius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lartius</sc></p>

<p>On safeguard he came to me, and did curse</p>

<p>Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely</p>

<p>Yielded the town. He is retired to Antium.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>Spoke he of me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lartius</sc>  He did, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  How? What?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lartius</sc></p>

<p>How often he had met you sword to sword;</p>

<p>That of all things upon the earth he hated</p>

<p>Your person most; that he would pawn his fortunes</p>

<p>To hopeless restitution, so he might</p>

<p>Be called your vanquisher.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  At Antium lives he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lartius</sc>  At Antium.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>I wish I had a cause to seek him there,</p>

<p>To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sicinius and Brutus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,</p>

<p>The tongues o’ th’ common mouth. I do despise</p>

<p>them,</p>

<p>For they do prank them in authority</p>

<p>Against all noble sufferance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Pass no further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Ha? What is that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>It will be dangerous to go on. No further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  What makes this change?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  The matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc></p>

<p>Hath he not passed the noble and the common?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Cominius, no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Have I had children’s voices?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>Tribunes, give way. He shall to th’ marketplace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>The people are incensed against him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Stop,</p>

<p>Or all will fall in broil.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Are these your herd?</p>

<p>Must these have voices, that can yield them now</p>

<p>And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your</p>

<p>offices?</p>

<p>You being their mouths, why rule you not their</p>

<p>teeth?</p>

<p>Have you not set them on?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Be calm, be calm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,</p>

<p>To curb the will of the nobility.</p>

<p>Suffer ’t, and live with such as cannot rule</p>

<p>Nor ever will be ruled.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Call ’t not a plot.</p>

<p>The people cry you mocked them; and, of late,</p>

<p>When corn was given them gratis, you repined,</p>

<p>Scandaled the suppliants for the people, called them</p>

<p>Timepleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>Why, this was known before.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Not to them all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>Have you informed them sithence?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  How? I inform</p>

<p>them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  You are like to do such business.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Not unlike, each way, to better yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,</p>

<p>Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me</p>

<p>Your fellow tribune.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  You show too much of that</p>

<p>For which the people stir. If you will pass</p>

<p>To where you are bound, you must inquire your</p>

<p>way,</p>

<p>Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,</p>

<p>Or never be so noble as a consul,</p>

<p>Nor yoke with him for tribune.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Let’s be calm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc></p>

<p>The people are abused, set on. This palt’ring</p>

<p>Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus</p>

<p>Deserved this so dishonored rub, laid falsely</p>

<p>I’ th’ plain way of his merit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Tell me of corn?</p>

<p>This was my speech, and I will speak ’t again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>Not now, not now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Not in this heat, sir, now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Now, as I live, I will.</p>

<p>My nobler friends, I crave their pardons. For</p>

<p>The mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them</p>

<p>Regard me, as I do not flatter, and</p>

<p>Therein behold themselves. I say again,</p>

<p>In soothing them, we nourish ’gainst our senate</p>

<p>The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,</p>

<p>Which we ourselves have plowed for, sowed, and</p>

<p>scattered</p>

<p>By mingling them with us, the honored number,</p>

<p>Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that</p>

<p>Which they have given to beggars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Well, no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>No more words, we beseech you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  How? No more?</p>

<p>As for my country I have shed my blood,</p>

<p>Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs</p>

<p>Coin words till their decay against those measles</p>

<p>Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought</p>

<p>The very way to catch them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  You speak o’ th’ people</p>

<p>As if you were a god to punish, not</p>

<p>A man of their infirmity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  ’Twere well</p>

<p>We let the people know ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  What, what? His choler?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Choler?</p>

<p>Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,</p>

<p>By Jove, ’twould be my mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  It is a mind</p>

<p>That shall remain a poison where it is,</p>

<p>Not poison any further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  “Shall remain”?</p>

<p>Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you</p>

<p>His absolute “shall”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  ’Twas from the canon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  “Shall”?</p>

<p>O good but most unwise patricians, why,</p>

<p>You grave but reckless senators, have you thus</p>

<p>Given Hydra here to choose an officer,</p>

<p>That with his peremptory “shall,” being but</p>

<p>The horn and noise o’ th’ monster’s, wants not spirit</p>

<p>To say he’ll turn your current in a ditch</p>

<p>And make your channel his? If he have power,</p>

<p>Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake</p>

<p>Your dangerous lenity. If you are learned,</p>

<p>Be not as common fools; if you are not,</p>

<p>Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,</p>

<p>If they be senators; and they are no less</p>

<p>When, both your voices blended, the great’st taste</p>

<p>Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,</p>

<p>And such a one as he, who puts his “shall,”</p>

<p>His popular “shall,” against a graver bench</p>

<p>Than ever frowned in Greece. By Jove himself,</p>

<p>It makes the consuls base! And my soul aches</p>

<p>To know, when two authorities are up,</p>

<p>Neither supreme, how soon confusion</p>

<p>May enter ’twixt the gap of both and take</p>

<p>The one by th’ other.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  Well, on to th’ marketplace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>Whoever gave that counsel to give forth</p>

<p>The corn o’ th’ storehouse gratis, as ’twas used</p>

<p>Sometime in Greece–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Well, well, no more of that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>Though there the people had more absolute power,</p>

<p>I say they nourished disobedience, fed</p>

<p>The ruin of the state.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Why shall the people give</p>

<p>One that speaks thus their voice?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  I’ll give my reasons,</p>

<p>More worthier than their voices. They know the</p>

<p>corn</p>

<p>Was not our recompense, resting well assured</p>

<p>They ne’er did service for ’t. Being pressed to th’ war,</p>

<p>Even when the navel of the state was touched,</p>

<p>They would not thread the gates. This kind of</p>

<p>service</p>

<p>Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i’ th’ war,</p>

<p>Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they showed</p>

<p>Most valor, spoke not for them. Th’ accusation</p>

<p>Which they have often made against the Senate,</p>

<p>All cause unborn, could never be the native</p>

<p>Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?</p>

<p>How shall this bosom multiplied digest</p>

<p>The Senate’s courtesy? Let deeds express</p>

<p>What’s like to be their words: “We did request it;</p>

<p>We are the greater poll, and in true fear</p>

<p>They gave us our demands.” Thus we debase</p>

<p>The nature of our seats and make the rabble</p>

<p>Call our cares fears, which will in time</p>

<p>Break ope the locks o’ th’ Senate and bring in</p>

<p>The crows to peck the eagles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Come, enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Enough, with over-measure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  No, take more!</p>

<p>What may be sworn by, both divine and human,</p>

<p>Seal what I end withal! This double worship–</p>

<p>Where one part does disdain with cause, the other</p>

<p>Insult without all reason, where gentry, title,</p>

<p>wisdom</p>

<p>Cannot conclude but by the yea and no</p>

<p>Of general ignorance–it must omit</p>

<p>Real necessities and give way the while</p>

<p>To unstable slightness. Purpose so barred, it follows</p>

<p>Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech</p>

<p>you–</p>

<p>You that will be less fearful than discreet,</p>

<p>That love the fundamental part of state</p>

<p>More than you doubt the change on ’t, that prefer</p>

<p>A noble life before a long, and wish</p>

<p>To jump a body with a dangerous physic</p>

<p>That’s sure of death without it–at once pluck out</p>

<p>The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick</p>

<p>The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonor</p>

<p>Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state</p>

<p>Of that integrity which should become ’t,</p>

<p>Not having the power to do the good it would</p>

<p>For th’ ill which doth control ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  ’Has said enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>’Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer</p>

<p>As traitors do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Thou wretch, despite o’erwhelm thee!</p>

<p>What should the people do with these bald tribunes,</p>

<p>On whom depending, their obedience fails</p>

<p>To th’ greater bench? In a rebellion,</p>

<p>When what’s not meet but what must be was law,</p>

<p>Then were they chosen. In a better hour,</p>

<p>Let what is meet be said it must be meet,</p>

<p>And throw their power i’ th’ dust.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Manifest treason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  This a consul? No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  The aediles, ho! Let him be apprehended.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter an Aedile.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>Go, call the people; <i>[Aedile exits.]</i> in whose name</p>

<p>myself</p>

<p>Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,</p>

<p>A foe to th’ public weal. Obey, I charge thee,</p>

<p>And follow to thine answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Hence, old goat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Patricians</sc></p>

<p>We’ll surety him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc> <i>[to Sicinius]</i>  Aged sir, hands off.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc> <i>[to Sicinius]</i></p>

<p>Hence, rotten thing, or I shall shake thy bones</p>

<p>Out of thy garments.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Help, you citizens!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a rabble of Plebeians with the Aediles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  On both sides more respect!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>Here’s he that would take from you all your power.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Seize him, aediles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Plebeians</sc>  Down with him, down with him!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Weapons, weapons, weapons!</p>

<p><center><i>[They all bustle about Coriolanus.]</i></center></p>

<p>Tribunes, patricians, citizens, what ho!</p>

<p>Sicinius, Brutus, Coriolanus, citizens!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Peace, peace, peace! Stay, hold, peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>What is about to be? I am out of breath.</p>

<p>Confusion’s near. I cannot speak. You, tribunes</p>

<p>To th’ people!–Coriolanus, patience!–</p>

<p>Speak, good Sicinius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Hear me, people! Peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Plebeians</sc></p>

<p>Let’s hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, speak, speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>You are at point to lose your liberties.</p>

<p>Martius would have all from you, Martius,</p>

<p>Whom late you have named for consul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Fie, fie, fie!</p>

<p>This is the way to kindle, not to quench.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>What is the city but the people?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Plebeians</sc>  True,</p>

<p>The people are the city.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>By the consent of all, we were established</p>

<p>The people’s magistrates.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Plebeians</sc>  You so remain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  And so are like to do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>That is the way to lay the city flat,</p>

<p>To bring the roof to the foundation</p>

<p>And bury all which yet distinctly ranges</p>

<p>In heaps and piles of ruin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  This deserves death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Or let us stand to our authority</p>

<p>Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,</p>

<p>Upon the part o’ th’ people, in whose power</p>

<p>We were elected theirs, Martius is worthy</p>

<p>Of present death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Therefore lay hold of him,</p>

<p>Bear him to th’ rock Tarpeian, and from thence</p>

<p>Into destruction cast him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Aediles, seize him!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Plebeians</sc></p>

<p>Yield, Martius, yield!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Hear me one word.</p>

<p>Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aediles</sc>  Peace, peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>Be that you seem, truly your country’s friend,</p>

<p>And temp’rately proceed to what you would</p>

<p>Thus violently redress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Sir, those cold ways,</p>

<p>That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous</p>

<p>Where the disease is violent.–Lay hands upon him,</p>

<p>And bear him to the rock.</p>

<p><center><i>[Coriolanus draws his sword.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  No, I’ll die here.</p>

<p>There’s some among you have beheld me fighting.</p>

<p>Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>Down with that sword!–Tribunes, withdraw awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Lay hands upon him!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Help Martius, help!</p>

<p>You that be noble, help him, young and old!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Plebeians</sc>  Down with him, down with him!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the Aediles, and the People</p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc> <i>[to Coriolanus]</i></p>

<p>Go, get you to your house. Begone, away.</p>

<p>All will be naught else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Get you gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Stand fast!</p>

<p>We have as many friends as enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>Shall it be put to that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  The gods forbid!–</p>

<p>I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;</p>

<p>Leave us to cure this cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  For ’tis a sore upon us</p>

<p>You cannot tent yourself. Begone, beseech you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  Come, sir, along with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>I would they were barbarians, as they are,</p>

<p>Though in Rome littered; not Romans, as they are</p>

<p>not,</p>

<p>Though calved i’ th’ porch o’ th’ Capitol.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Begone!</p>

<p>Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.</p>

<p>One time will owe another.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  On fair ground</p>

<p>I could beat forty of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  I could myself</p>

<p>Take up a brace o’ th’ best of them, yea, the two</p>

<p>tribunes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc></p>

<p>But now ’tis odds beyond arithmetic,</p>

<p>And manhood is called foolery when it stands</p>

<p>Against a falling fabric. <i>[To Coriolanus.]</i> Will you</p>

<p>hence,</p>

<p>Before the tag return, whose rage doth rend</p>

<p>Like interrupted waters and o’erbear</p>

<p>What they are used to bear?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc> <i>[to Coriolanus]</i>  Pray you, begone.</p>

<p>I’ll try whether my old wit be in request</p>

<p>With those that have but little. This must be patched</p>

<p>With cloth of any color.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  Nay, come away.</p>

<p><center><i>[Coriolanus and Cominius exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patrician</sc>  This man has marred his fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>His nature is too noble for the world.</p>

<p>He would not flatter Neptune for his trident</p>

<p>Or Jove for ’s power to thunder. His heart’s his</p>

<p>mouth;</p>

<p>What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent,</p>

<p>And, being angry, does forget that ever</p>

<p>He heard the name of death.     <i><i>[A noise within.]</i></i></p>

<p>Here’s goodly work.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patrician</sc>  I would they were abed!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>I would they were in Tiber. What the vengeance,</p>

<p>Could he not speak ’em fair?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Brutus and Sicinius with the rabble again.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Where is this viper</p>

<p>That would depopulate the city and</p>

<p>Be every man himself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  You worthy tribunes–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock</p>

<p>With rigorous hands. He hath resisted law,</p>

<p>And therefore law shall scorn him further trial</p>

<p>Than the severity of the public power</p>

<p>Which he so sets at naught.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Citizen</sc>  He shall well know</p>

<p>The noble tribunes are the people’s mouths</p>

<p>And we their hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Plebeians</sc>  He shall, sure on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Sir, sir–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>Do not cry havoc where you should but hunt</p>

<p>With modest warrant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Sir, how comes ’t that you</p>

<p>Have holp to make this rescue?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Hear me speak.</p>

<p>As I do know the Consul’s worthiness,</p>

<p>So can I name his faults.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Consul? What consul?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  The consul Coriolanus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  He consul?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Plebeians</sc>  No, no, no, no, no!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>If, by the Tribunes’ leave, and yours, good people,</p>

<p>I may be heard, I would crave a word or two,</p>

<p>The which shall turn you to no further harm</p>

<p>Than so much loss of time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Speak briefly then,</p>

<p>For we are peremptory to dispatch</p>

<p>This viperous traitor. To eject him hence</p>

<p>Were but one danger, and to keep him here</p>

<p>Our certain death. Therefore it is decreed</p>

<p>He dies tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Now the good gods forbid</p>

<p>That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude</p>

<p>Towards her deserved children is enrolled</p>

<p>In Jove’s own book, like an unnatural dam</p>

<p>Should now eat up her own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>He’s a disease that must be cut away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>O, he’s a limb that has but a disease–</p>

<p>Mortal to cut it off; to cure it easy.</p>

<p>What has he done to Rome that’s worthy death?</p>

<p>Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost–</p>

<p>Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath</p>

<p>By many an ounce–he dropped it for his country;</p>

<p>And what is left, to lose it by his country</p>

<p>Were to us all that do ’t and suffer it</p>

<p>A brand to th’ end o’ th’ world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  This is clean cam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Merely awry. When he did love his country,</p>

<p>It honored him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  The service of the foot,</p>

<p>Being once gangrened, is not then respected</p>

<p>For what before it was.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  We’ll hear no more.</p>

<p>Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence,</p>

<p>Lest his infection, being of catching nature,</p>

<p>Spread further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  One word more, one word!</p>

<p>This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find</p>

<p>The harm of unscanned swiftness, will too late</p>

<p>Tie leaden pounds to ’s heels. Proceed by process,</p>

<p>Lest parties–as he is beloved–break out</p>

<p>And sack great Rome with Romans.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  If it were so–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  What do you talk?</p>

<p>Have we not had a taste of his obedience?</p>

<p>Our aediles smote! Ourselves resisted! Come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>Consider this: he has been bred i’ th’ wars</p>

<p>Since he could draw a sword, and is ill schooled</p>

<p>In bolted language; meal and bran together</p>

<p>He throws without distinction. Give me leave,</p>

<p>I’ll go to him and undertake to bring him</p>

<p>Where he shall answer by a lawful form,</p>

<p>In peace, to his utmost peril.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Noble tribunes,</p>

<p>It is the humane way: the other course</p>

<p>Will prove too bloody, and the end of it</p>

<p>Unknown to the beginning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Noble Menenius,</p>

<p>Be you then as the people’s officer.–</p>

<p>Masters, lay down your weapons.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Go not home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>Meet on the marketplace. <i>[To Menenius.]</i> We’ll</p>

<p>attend you there,</p>

<p>Where if you bring not Martius, we’ll proceed</p>

<p>In our first way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  I’ll bring him to you.</p>

<p><i>[To Senators.]</i> Let me desire your company. He must</p>

<p>come,</p>

<p>Or what is worst will follow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Pray you, let’s to him.</p>

<p><center><i>[All exit.]</i></center></p>
