<p><center><i>[Enter a Roman (Nicanor) and a Volsce (Adrian).]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roman</sc>  I know you well, sir, and you know me. Your</p>

<p>name I think is Adrian.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volsce</sc>  It is so, sir. Truly, I have forgot you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roman</sc>  I am a Roman, and my services are, as you are,</p>

<p>against ’em. Know you me yet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volsce</sc>  Nicanor, no?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roman</sc>  The same, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volsce</sc>  You had more beard when I last saw you, but</p>

<p>your favor is well approved by your tongue.</p>

<p>What’s the news in Rome? I have a note from the</p>

<p>Volscian state to find you out there. You have well</p>

<p>saved me a day’s journey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roman</sc>  There hath been in Rome strange insurrections,</p>

<p>the people against the senators, patricians,</p>

<p>and nobles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volsce</sc>  Hath been? Is it ended, then? Our state thinks</p>

<p>not so. They are in a most warlike preparation and</p>

<p>hope to come upon them in the heat of their</p>

<p>division.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roman</sc>  The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing</p>

<p>would make it flame again; for the nobles receive</p>

<p>so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus</p>

<p>that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power</p>

<p>from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes</p>

<p>forever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and</p>

<p>is almost mature for the violent breaking out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volsce</sc>  Coriolanus banished?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roman</sc>  Banished, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volsce</sc>  You will be welcome with this intelligence,</p>

<p>Nicanor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roman</sc>  The day serves well for them now. I have heard</p>

<p>it said the fittest time to corrupt a man’s wife is</p>

<p>when she’s fall’n out with her husband. Your noble</p>

<p>Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his</p>

<p>great opposer Coriolanus being now in no request</p>

<p>of his country.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volsce</sc>  He cannot choose. I am most fortunate thus</p>

<p>accidentally to encounter you. You have ended my</p>

<p>business, and I will merrily accompany you home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roman</sc>  I shall between this and supper tell you most</p>

<p>strange things from Rome, all tending to the good</p>

<p>of their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say</p>

<p>you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volsce</sc>  A most royal one. The centurions and their</p>

<p>charges, distinctly billeted, already in th’ entertainment,</p>

<p>and to be on foot at an hour’s warning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roman</sc>  I am joyful to hear of their readiness and am</p>

<p>the man, I think, that shall set them in present action.</p>

<p>So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of</p>

<p>your company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Volsce</sc>  You take my part from me, sir. I have the most</p>

<p>cause to be glad of yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roman</sc>  Well, let us go together.</p>
