<p><center><i>[Enter Menenius, Cominius, Sicinius, Brutus (the two</p>

<p>Tribunes), with others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc></p>

<p>No, I’ll not go. You hear what he hath said</p>

<p>Which was sometime his general, who loved him</p>

<p>In a most dear particular. He called me father,</p>

<p>But what o’ that? Go you that banished him;</p>

<p>A mile before his tent, fall down, and knee</p>

<p>The way into his mercy. Nay, if he coyed</p>

<p>To hear Cominius speak, I’ll keep at home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc></p>

<p>He would not seem to know me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Do you hear?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc></p>

<p>Yet one time he did call me by my name.</p>

<p>I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops</p>

<p>That we have bled together. “Coriolanus”</p>

<p>He would not answer to, forbade all names.</p>

<p>He was a kind of nothing, titleless,</p>

<p>Till he had forged himself a name o’ th’ fire</p>

<p>Of burning Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc> <i>[to the Tribunes]</i></p>

<p>Why, so; you have made good work!</p>

<p>A pair of tribunes that have wracked Rome</p>

<p>To make coals cheap! A noble memory!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc></p>

<p>I minded him how royal ’twas to pardon</p>

<p>When it was less expected. He replied</p>

<p>It was a bare petition of a state</p>

<p>To one whom they had punished.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Very well.</p>

<p>Could he say less?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc></p>

<p>I offered to awaken his regard</p>

<p>For ’s private friends. His answer to me was</p>

<p>He could not stay to pick them in a pile</p>

<p>Of noisome musty chaff. He said ’twas folly</p>

<p>For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt</p>

<p>And still to nose th’ offense.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  For one poor grain or two!</p>

<p>I am one of those! His mother, wife, his child,</p>

<p>And this brave fellow too, we are the grains;</p>

<p>You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt</p>

<p>Above the moon. We must be burnt for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc></p>

<p>Nay, pray, be patient. If you refuse your aid</p>

<p>In this so-never-needed help, yet do not</p>

<p>Upbraid ’s with our distress. But sure, if you</p>

<p>Would be your country’s pleader, your good tongue,</p>

<p>More than the instant army we can make,</p>

<p>Might stop our countryman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  No, I’ll not meddle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Pray you, go to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  What should I do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Only make trial what your love can do</p>

<p>For Rome, towards Martius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Well, and say that</p>

<p>Martius</p>

<p>Return me, as Cominius is returned, unheard,</p>

<p>What then? But as a discontented friend,</p>

<p>Grief-shot with his unkindness? Say ’t be so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Yet your good will</p>

<p>Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure</p>

<p>As you intended well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  I’ll undertake ’t.</p>

<p>I think he’ll hear me. Yet to bite his lip</p>

<p>And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.</p>

<p>He was not taken well; he had not dined.</p>

<p>The veins unfilled, our blood is cold, and then</p>

<p>We pout upon the morning, are unapt</p>

<p>To give or to forgive; but when we have stuffed</p>

<p>These pipes and these conveyances of our blood</p>

<p>With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls</p>

<p>Than in our priestlike fasts. Therefore I’ll watch him</p>

<p>Till he be dieted to my request,</p>

<p>And then I’ll set upon him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>You know the very road into his kindness</p>

<p>And cannot lose your way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menenius</sc>  Good faith, I’ll prove him,</p>

<p>Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge</p>

<p>Of my success.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc>  He’ll never hear him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sicinius</sc>  Not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cominius</sc></p>

<p>I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye</p>

<p>Red as ’twould burn Rome; and his injury</p>

<p>The jailor to his pity. I kneeled before him;</p>

<p>’Twas very faintly he said “Rise”; dismissed me</p>

<p>Thus with his speechless hand. What he would do</p>

<p>He sent in writing after me; what he</p>

<p>Would not, bound with an oath to yield to his</p>

<p>Conditions. So that all hope is vain</p>

<p>Unless his noble mother and his wife,</p>

<p>Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him</p>

<p>For mercy to his country. Therefore let’s hence</p>

<p>And with our fair entreaties haste them on.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
