<p><center><i>[Enter Cominius as it were in retire, with Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span></p>

<p>Breathe you, my friends. Well fought! We are come</p>

<p>off</p>

<p>Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands</p>

<p>Nor cowardly in retire. Believe me, sirs,</p>

<p>We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,</p>

<p>By interims and conveying gusts we have heard</p>

<p>The charges of our friends. The Roman gods</p>

<p>Lead their successes as we wish our own,</p>

<p>That both our powers, with smiling fronts</p>

<p>encount’ring,</p>

<p>May give you thankful sacrifice!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Thy news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>The citizens of Corioles have issued</p>

<p>And given to Lartius and to Martius battle.</p>

<p>I saw our party to their trenches driven,</p>

<p>And then I came away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Though thou speakest truth,</p>

<p>Methinks thou speak’st not well. How long is ’t</p>

<p>since?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Above an hour, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span></p>

<p>’Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums.</p>

<p>How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour</p>

<p>And bring thy news so late?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Spies of the Volsces</p>

<p>Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel</p>

<p>Three or four miles about; else had I, sir,</p>

<p>Half an hour since brought my report.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Martius, bloody.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Who’s yonder,</p>

<p>That does appear as he were flayed? O gods,</p>

<p>He has the stamp of Martius, and I have</p>

<p>Before-time seen him thus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span>  Come I too late?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span></p>

<p>The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor</p>

<p>More than I know the sound of Martius’ tongue</p>

<p>From every meaner man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span>  Come I too late?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span></p>

<p>Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,</p>

<p>But mantled in your own.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span>  O, let me clip you</p>

<p>In arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart</p>

<p>As merry as when our nuptial day was done</p>

<p>And tapers burnt to bedward!     <i><i>[They embrace.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span></p>

<p>Flower of warriors, how is ’t with Titus Lartius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>As with a man busied about decrees,</p>

<p>Condemning some to death and some to exile;</p>

<p>Ransoming him or pitying, threat’ning th’ other;</p>

<p>Holding Corioles in the name of Rome</p>

<p>Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,</p>

<p>To let him slip at will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Where is that slave</p>

<p>Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?</p>

<p>Where is he? Call him hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span>  Let him alone.</p>

<p>He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen,</p>

<p>The common file–a plague! Tribunes for them!–</p>

<p>The mouse ne’er shunned the cat as they did budge</p>

<p>From rascals worse than they.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  But how prevailed you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.</p>

<p>Where is the enemy? Are you lords o’ th’ field?</p>

<p>If not, why cease you till you are so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span></p>

<p>Martius, we have at disadvantage fought</p>

<p>And did retire to win our purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>How lies their battle? Know you on which side</p>

<p>They have placed their men of trust?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  As I guess,</p>

<p>Martius,</p>

<p>Their bands i’ th’ vaward are the Antiates,</p>

<p>Of their best trust; o’er them Aufidius,</p>

<p>Their very heart of hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span>  I do beseech you,</p>

<p>By all the battles wherein we have fought,</p>

<p>By th’ blood we have shed together, by th’ vows we</p>

<p>have made</p>

<p>To endure friends, that you directly set me</p>

<p>Against Aufidius and his Antiates,</p>

<p>And that you not delay the present, but,</p>

<p>Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,</p>

<p>We prove this very hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Though I could wish</p>

<p>You were conducted to a gentle bath</p>

<p>And balms applied to you, yet dare I never</p>

<p>Deny your asking. Take your choice of those</p>

<p>That best can aid your action.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span>  Those are they</p>

<p>That most are willing. If any such be here–</p>

<p>As it were sin to doubt–that love this painting</p>

<p>Wherein you see me smeared; if any fear</p>

<p>Lesser his person than an ill report;</p>

<p>If any think brave death outweighs bad life,</p>

<p>And that his country’s dearer than himself;</p>

<p>Let him alone, or so many so minded,</p>

<p>Wave thus to express his disposition</p>

<p>And follow Martius.     <i><i>[He waves his sword.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[They all shout and wave their swords,</p>

<p>take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, me alone! Make you a sword of me?</p>

<p>If these shows be not outward, which of you</p>

<p>But is four Volsces? None of you but is</p>

<p>Able to bear against the great Aufidius</p>

<p>A shield as hard as his. A certain number,</p>

<p>Though thanks to all, must I select from all.</p>

<p>The rest shall bear the business in some other fight,</p>

<p>As cause will be obeyed. Please you to march,</p>

<p>And I shall quickly draw out my command,</p>

<p>Which men are best inclined.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  March on, my fellows.</p>

<p>Make good this ostentation, and you shall</p>

<p>Divide in all with us.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
