<p><center><i>[Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish. Enter, at one</p>

<p>door, Cominius with the Romans; at another door</p>

<p>Martius, with his arm in a scarf.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span> <i>[to Martius]</i></p>

<p>If I should tell thee o’er this thy day’s work,</p>

<p>Thou ’t not believe thy deeds. But I’ll report it</p>

<p>Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles;</p>

<p>Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,</p>

<p>I’ th’ end admire; where ladies shall be frighted</p>

<p>And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the dull</p>

<p>tribunes,</p>

<p>That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honors,</p>

<p>Shall say against their hearts “We thank the gods</p>

<p>Our Rome hath such a soldier.”</p>

<p>Yet cam’st thou to a morsel of this feast,</p>

<p>Having fully dined before.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Titus Lartius with his power, from the pursuit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lartius</span>  O general,</p>

<p>Here is the steed, we the caparison.</p>

<p>Hadst thou beheld–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span>  Pray now, no more. My mother,</p>

<p>Who has a charter to extol her blood,</p>

<p>When she does praise me grieves me. I have done</p>

<p>As you have done–that’s what I can;</p>

<p>Induced as you have been–that’s for my country.</p>

<p>He that has but effected his good will</p>

<p>Hath overta’en mine act.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  You shall not be</p>

<p>The grave of your deserving. Rome must know</p>

<p>The value of her own. ’Twere a concealment</p>

<p>Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,</p>

<p>To hide your doings and to silence that</p>

<p>Which, to the spire and top of praises vouched,</p>

<p>Would seem but modest. Therefore, I beseech you–</p>

<p>In sign of what you are, not to reward</p>

<p>What you have done–before our army hear me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span></p>

<p>I have some wounds upon me, and they smart</p>

<p>To hear themselves remembered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Should they not,</p>

<p>Well might they fester ’gainst ingratitude</p>

<p>And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses–</p>

<p>Whereof we have ta’en good and good store–of all</p>

<p>The treasure in this field achieved and city,</p>

<p>We render you the tenth, to be ta’en forth</p>

<p>Before the common distribution</p>

<p>At your only choice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Martius</span>  I thank you, general,</p>

<p>But cannot make my heart consent to take</p>

<p>A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it</p>

<p>And stand upon my common part with those</p>

<p>That have beheld the doing.</p>

<p><center><i>[A long flourish. They all cry “Martius, Martius!”</p>

<p>and cast up their caps and lances.</p>

<p>Cominius and Lartius stand bare.]</i></center></p>

<p>May these same instruments, which you profane,</p>

<p>Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall</p>

<p>I’ th’ field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be</p>

<p>Made all of false-faced soothing! When steel grows</p>

<p>Soft as the parasite’s silk, let him be made</p>

<p>An ovator for th’ wars! No more, I say.</p>

<p>For that I have not washed my nose that bled,</p>

<p>Or foiled some debile wretch–which, without note,</p>

<p>Here’s many else have done–you shout me forth</p>

<p>In acclamations hyperbolical,</p>

<p>As if I loved my little should be dieted</p>

<p>In praises sauced with lies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Too modest are you,</p>

<p>More cruel to your good report than grateful</p>

<p>To us that give you truly. By your patience,</p>

<p>If ’gainst yourself you be incensed, we’ll put you,</p>

<p>Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,</p>

<p>Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known,</p>

<p>As to us to all the world, that Caius Martius</p>

<p>Wears this war’s garland, in token of the which</p>

<p>My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,</p>

<p>With all his trim belonging. And from this time,</p>

<p>For what he did before Corioles, call him,</p>

<p>With all th’ applause and clamor of the host,</p>

<p>Martius Caius Coriolanus! Bear</p>

<p>Th’ addition nobly ever!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span></p>

<p>Martius Caius Coriolanus!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  I will go wash;</p>

<p>And when my face is fair, you shall perceive</p>

<p>Whether I blush or no. Howbeit, I thank you.</p>

<p>I mean to stride your steed and at all times</p>

<p>To undercrest your good addition</p>

<p>To th’ fairness of my power.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  So, to our tent,</p>

<p>Where, ere we do repose us, we will write</p>

<p>To Rome of our success.–You, Titus Lartius,</p>

<p>Must to Corioles back. Send us to Rome</p>

<p>The best, with whom we may articulate</p>

<p>For their own good and ours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lartius</span>  I shall, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>The gods begin to mock me. I, that now</p>

<p>Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg</p>

<p>Of my lord general.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Take ’t, ’tis yours. What is ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>I sometime lay here in Corioles</p>

<p>At a poor man’s house; he used me kindly.</p>

<p>He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;</p>

<p>But then Aufidius was within my view,</p>

<p>And wrath o’erwhelmed my pity. I request you</p>

<p>To give my poor host freedom.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  O, well begged!</p>

<p>Were he the butcher of my son, he should</p>

<p>Be free as is the wind.–Deliver him, Titus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lartius</span></p>

<p>Martius, his name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  By Jupiter, forgot!</p>

<p>I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.</p>

<p>Have we no wine here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Go we to our tent.</p>

<p>The blood upon your visage dries; ’tis time</p>

<p>It should be looked to. Come.</p>
