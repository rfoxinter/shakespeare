<p><center><i>[Enter Tullus Aufidius, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc></p>

<p>Go tell the lords o’ th’ city I am here.</p>

<p>Deliver them this paper.     <i><i>[(He gives them a paper.)]</i></i></p>

<p>Having read it,</p>

<p>Bid them repair to th’ marketplace, where I,</p>

<p>Even in theirs and in the commons’ ears,</p>

<p>Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse</p>

<p>The city ports by this hath entered and</p>

<p>Intends t’ appear before the people, hoping</p>

<p>To purge himself with words. Dispatch.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Attendants exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter three or four Conspirators of Aufidius’s faction.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Most welcome!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Conspirator</sc></p>

<p>How is it with our general?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  Even so</p>

<p>As with a man by his own alms empoisoned</p>

<p>And with his charity slain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Conspirator</sc>  Most noble sir,</p>

<p>If you do hold the same intent wherein</p>

<p>You wished us parties, we’ll deliver you</p>

<p>Of your great danger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  Sir, I cannot tell.</p>

<p>We must proceed as we do find the people.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Conspirator</sc></p>

<p>The people will remain uncertain whilst</p>

<p>’Twixt you there’s difference, but the fall of either</p>

<p>Makes the survivor heir of all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  I know it,</p>

<p>And my pretext to strike at him admits</p>

<p>A good construction. I raised him, and I pawned</p>

<p>Mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened,</p>

<p>He watered his new plants with dews of flattery,</p>

<p>Seducing so my friends; and to this end,</p>

<p>He bowed his nature, never known before</p>

<p>But to be rough, unswayable, and free.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Conspirator</sc>  Sir, his stoutness</p>

<p>When he did stand for consul, which he lost</p>

<p>By lack of stooping–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  That I would have spoke of.</p>

<p>Being banished for ’t, he came unto my hearth,</p>

<p>Presented to my knife his throat. I took him,</p>

<p>Made him joint servant with me, gave him way</p>

<p>In all his own desires; nay, let him choose</p>

<p>Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,</p>

<p>My best and freshest men; served his designments</p>

<p>In mine own person; holp to reap the fame</p>

<p>Which he did end all his; and took some pride</p>

<p>To do myself this wrong; till at the last</p>

<p>I seemed his follower, not partner; and</p>

<p>He waged me with his countenance as if</p>

<p>I had been mercenary.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Conspirator</sc>  So he did, my lord.</p>

<p>The army marvelled at it, and, in the last,</p>

<p>When he had carried Rome and that we looked</p>

<p>For no less spoil than glory–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  There was it</p>

<p>For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.</p>

<p>At a few drops of women’s rheum, which are</p>

<p>As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor</p>

<p>Of our great action. Therefore shall he die,</p>

<p>And I’ll renew me in his fall. But hark!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Drums and trumpets sounds, with great shouts</p>

<p>of the people.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Conspirator</sc></p>

<p>Your native town you entered like a post</p>

<p>And had no welcomes home, but he returns</p>

<p>Splitting the air with noise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Conspirator</sc>  And patient fools,</p>

<p>Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear</p>

<p>With giving him glory.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Conspirator</sc>  Therefore at your vantage,</p>

<p>Ere he express himself or move the people</p>

<p>With what he would say, let him feel your sword,</p>

<p>Which we will second. When he lies along,</p>

<p>After your way his tale pronounced shall bury</p>

<p>His reasons with his body.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  Say no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Lords of the city.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here come the lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Lords</sc></p>

<p>You are most welcome home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  I have not deserved it.</p>

<p>But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused</p>

<p>What I have written to you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Lords</sc>  We have.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  And grieve to hear ’t.</p>

<p>What faults he made before the last, I think</p>

<p>Might have found easy fines, but there to end</p>

<p>Where he was to begin and give away</p>

<p>The benefit of our levies, answering us</p>

<p>With our own charge, making a treaty where</p>

<p>There was a yielding–this admits no excuse.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Coriolanus marching with Drum and Colors, the</p>

<p>Commoners being with him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  He approaches. You shall hear him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>Hail, lords! I am returned your soldier,</p>

<p>No more infected with my country’s love</p>

<p>Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting</p>

<p>Under your great command. You are to know</p>

<p>That prosperously I have attempted, and</p>

<p>With bloody passage led your wars even to</p>

<p>The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought</p>

<p>home</p>

<p>Doth more than counterpoise a full third part</p>

<p>The charges of the action. We have made peace</p>

<p>With no less honor to the Antiates</p>

<p>Than shame to th’ Romans, and we here deliver,</p>

<p>Subscribed by’ th’ Consuls and patricians,</p>

<p>Together with the seal o’ th’ Senate, what</p>

<p>We have compounded on.</p>

<p><center><i>[He offers the lords a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  Read it not, noble lords,</p>

<p>But tell the traitor in the highest degree</p>

<p>He hath abused your powers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  “Traitor”? How now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  Ay, traitor, Martius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Martius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc></p>

<p>Ay, Martius, Caius Martius. Dost thou think</p>

<p>I’ll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol’n name</p>

<p>Coriolanus, in Corioles?</p>

<p>You lords and heads o’ th’ state, perfidiously</p>

<p>He has betrayed your business and given up</p>

<p>For certain drops of salt your city Rome–</p>

<p>I say your city–to his wife and mother,</p>

<p>Breaking his oath and resolution like</p>

<p>A twist of rotten silk, never admitting</p>

<p>Counsel o’ th’ war, but at his nurse’s tears</p>

<p>He whined and roared away your victory,</p>

<p>That pages blushed at him and men of heart</p>

<p>Looked wond’ring each at other.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Hear’st thou, Mars?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  Name not the god, thou boy of tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc>  Ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  No more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart</p>

<p>Too great for what contains it. “Boy”? O slave!–</p>

<p>Pardon me, lords, ’tis the first time that ever</p>

<p>I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave</p>

<p>lords,</p>

<p>Must give this cur the lie; and his own notion–</p>

<p>Who wears my stripes impressed upon him, that</p>

<p>Must bear my beating to his grave–shall join</p>

<p>To thrust the lie unto him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Peace, both, and hear me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc></p>

<p>Cut me to pieces, Volsces. Men and lads,</p>

<p>Stain all your edges on me. “Boy”? False hound!</p>

<p>If you have writ your annals true, ’tis there</p>

<p>That like an eagle in a dovecote, I</p>

<p>Fluttered your Volscians in Corioles,</p>

<p>Alone I did it. “Boy”!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  Why, noble lords,</p>

<p>Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,</p>

<p>Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,</p>

<p>’Fore your own eyes and ears?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Conspirators</sc>  Let him die for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>People</sc>  Tear him to pieces! Do it presently! He</p>

<p>killed my son! My daughter! He killed my cousin</p>

<p>Marcus! He killed my father!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Peace, ho! No outrage! Peace!</p>

<p>The man is noble, and his fame folds in</p>

<p>This orb o’ th’ Earth. His last offenses to us</p>

<p>Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,</p>

<p>And trouble not the peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Coriolanus</sc> <i>[drawing his sword]</i>  O, that I had him,</p>

<p>With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,</p>

<p>To use my lawful sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  Insolent villain!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>Conspirators</sc>  Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Draw the Conspirators, and kills Martius, who falls.</p>

<p>Aufidius stands on him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lords</sc>  Hold, hold, hold, hold!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc></p>

<p>My noble masters, hear me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  O Tullus!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Thou hast done a deed whereat valor will weep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Tread not upon him.–Masters, all be quiet.–</p>

<p>Put up your swords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc></p>

<p>My lords, when you shall know–as in this rage,</p>

<p>Provoked by him, you cannot–the great danger</p>

<p>Which this man’s life did owe you, you’ll rejoice</p>

<p>That he is thus cut off. Please it your Honors</p>

<p>To call me to your senate, I’ll deliver</p>

<p>Myself your loyal servant or endure</p>

<p>Your heaviest censure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Bear from hence his body,</p>

<p>And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded</p>

<p>As the most noble corse that ever herald</p>

<p>Did follow to his urn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  His own impatience</p>

<p>Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.</p>

<p>Let’s make the best of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aufidius</sc>  My rage is gone,</p>

<p>And I am struck with sorrow.–Take him up.</p>

<p>Help, three o’ th’ chiefest soldiers; I’ll be one.–</p>

<p>Beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully.–</p>

<p>Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he</p>

<p>Hath widowed and unchilded many a one,</p>

<p>Which to this hour bewail the injury,</p>

<p>Yet he shall have a noble memory.</p>

<p>Assist.</p>
