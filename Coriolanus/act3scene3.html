<p><center><i>[Enter Sicinius and Brutus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>In this point charge him home, that he affects</p>

<p>Tyrannical power. If he evade us there,</p>

<p>Enforce him with his envy to the people,</p>

<p>And that the spoil got on the Antiates</p>

<p>Was ne’er distributed.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter an Aedile.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What, will he come?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aedile</span>  He’s coming.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  How accompanied?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aedile</span></p>

<p>With old Menenius, and those senators</p>

<p>That always favored him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Have you a catalogue</p>

<p>Of all the voices that we have procured,</p>

<p>Set down by th’ poll?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aedile</span>  I have. ’Tis ready.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span></p>

<p>Have you collected them by tribes?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aedile</span>  I have.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span></p>

<p>Assemble presently the people hither;</p>

<p>And when they hear me say “It shall be so</p>

<p>I’ th’ right and strength o’ th’ commons,” be it either</p>

<p>For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them</p>

<p>If I say “Fine,” cry “Fine,” if “Death,” cry “Death,”</p>

<p>Insisting on the old prerogative</p>

<p>And power i’ th’ truth o’ th’ cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aedile</span>  I shall inform them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>And when such time they have begun to cry,</p>

<p>Let them not cease, but with a din confused</p>

<p>Enforce the present execution</p>

<p>Of what we chance to sentence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aedile</span>  Very well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span></p>

<p>Make them be strong and ready for this hint</p>

<p>When we shall hap to give ’t them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Go about it.</p>

<p><center><i>[Aedile exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Put him to choler straight. He hath been used</p>

<p>Ever to conquer and to have his worth</p>

<p>Of contradiction. Being once chafed, he cannot</p>

<p>Be reined again to temperance; then he speaks</p>

<p>What’s in his heart, and that is there which looks</p>

<p>With us to break his neck.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Coriolanus, Menenius, and Cominius, with</p>

<p>others (Senators).]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Well, here he comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span> <i>[aside to Coriolanus]</i>  Calmly, I do beseech</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span> <i>[aside to Menenius]</i></p>

<p>Ay, as an hostler that for th’ poorest piece</p>

<p>Will bear the knave by th’ volume.–Th’ honored</p>

<p>gods</p>

<p>Keep Rome in safety and the chairs of justice</p>

<p>Supplied with worthy men! Plant love among ’s!</p>

<p>Throng our large temples with the shows of peace</p>

<p>And not our streets with war!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  Amen, amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  A noble wish.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Aedile with the Plebeians.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Draw near, you people.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aedile</span></p>

<p>List to your tribunes. Audience! Peace, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  First, hear me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span> <span class='sc'>Tribunes</span>  Well, say.–Peace, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>Shall I be charged no further than this present?</p>

<p>Must all determine here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  I do demand</p>

<p>If you submit you to the people’s voices,</p>

<p>Allow their officers, and are content</p>

<p>To suffer lawful censure for such faults</p>

<p>As shall be proved upon you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  I am content.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span></p>

<p>Lo, citizens, he says he is content.</p>

<p>The warlike service he has done, consider. Think</p>

<p>Upon the wounds his body bears, which show</p>

<p>Like graves i’ th’ holy churchyard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Scratches with</p>

<p>briars,</p>

<p>Scars to move laughter only.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Consider further,</p>

<p>That when he speaks not like a citizen,</p>

<p>You find him like a soldier. Do not take</p>

<p>His rougher accents for malicious sounds,</p>

<p>But, as I say, such as become a soldier</p>

<p>Rather than envy you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Well, well, no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  What is the matter,</p>

<p>That, being passed for consul with full voice,</p>

<p>I am so dishonored that the very hour</p>

<p>You take it off again?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Answer to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Say then. ’Tis true, I ought so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span></p>

<p>We charge you that you have contrived to take</p>

<p>From Rome all seasoned office and to wind</p>

<p>Yourself into a power tyrannical,</p>

<p>For which you are a traitor to the people.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>How? Traitor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Nay, temperately! Your promise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>The fires i’ th’ lowest hell fold in the people!</p>

<p>Call me their traitor? Thou injurious tribune!</p>

<p>Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,</p>

<p>In thy hands clutched as many millions, in</p>

<p>Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say</p>

<p>“Thou liest” unto thee with a voice as free</p>

<p>As I do pray the gods.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Mark you this, people?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>Plebeians</span>  To th’ rock, to th’ rock with him!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Peace!</p>

<p>We need not put new matter to his charge.</p>

<p>What you have seen him do and heard him speak,</p>

<p>Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,</p>

<p>Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying</p>

<p>Those whose great power must try him–even this,</p>

<p>So criminal and in such capital kind,</p>

<p>Deserves th’ extremest death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  But since he hath</p>

<p>Served well for Rome–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  What do you prate of service?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  I talk of that that know it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  You?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span></p>

<p>Is this the promise that you made your mother?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Know, I pray you–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  I’ll know no further.</p>

<p>Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,</p>

<p>Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger</p>

<p>But with a grain a day, I would not buy</p>

<p>Their mercy at the price of one fair word,</p>

<p>Nor check my courage for what they can give,</p>

<p>To have ’t with saying “Good morrow.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  For that he has,</p>

<p>As much as in him lies, from time to time</p>

<p>Envied against the people, seeking means</p>

<p>To pluck away their power, as now at last</p>

<p>Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence</p>

<p>Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers</p>

<p>That doth distribute it, in the name o’ th’ people</p>

<p>And in the power of us the Tribunes, we,</p>

<p>Even from this instant, banish him our city</p>

<p>In peril of precipitation</p>

<p>From off the rock Tarpeian, never more</p>

<p>To enter our Rome gates. I’ th’ people’s name,</p>

<p>I say it shall be so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>Plebeians</span></p>

<p>It shall be so, it shall be so! Let him away!</p>

<p>He’s banished, and it shall be so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span></p>

<p>Hear me, my masters and my common friends–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span></p>

<p>He’s sentenced. No more hearing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Let me speak.</p>

<p>I have been consul and can show for Rome</p>

<p>Her enemies’ marks upon me. I do love</p>

<p>My country’s good with a respect more tender,</p>

<p>More holy and profound, than mine own life,</p>

<p>My dear wife’s estimate, her womb’s increase,</p>

<p>And treasure of my loins. Then if I would</p>

<p>Speak that–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  We know your drift. Speak what?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>There’s no more to be said, but he is banished</p>

<p>As enemy to the people and his country.</p>

<p>It shall be so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>Plebeians</span>  It shall be so, it shall be so!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>You common cry of curs, whose breath I hate</p>

<p>As reek o’ th’ rotten fens, whose loves I prize</p>

<p>As the dead carcasses of unburied men</p>

<p>That do corrupt my air, I banish you!</p>

<p>And here remain with your uncertainty;</p>

<p>Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts;</p>

<p>Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,</p>

<p>Fan you into despair! Have the power still</p>

<p>To banish your defenders, till at length</p>

<p>Your ignorance–which finds not till it feels,</p>

<p>Making but reservation of yourselves,</p>

<p>Still your own foes–deliver you</p>

<p>As most abated captives to some nation</p>

<p>That won you without blows! Despising</p>

<p>For you the city, thus I turn my back.</p>

<p>There is a world elsewhere.</p>

<p><center><i>[Coriolanus, Cominius, with others (Senators) exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aedile</span></p>

<p>The people’s enemy is gone, is gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>Plebeians</span></p>

<p>Our enemy is banished; he is gone. Hoo, hoo!</p>

<p><center><i>[They all shout and throw up their caps.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span></p>

<p>Go see him out at gates, and follow him,</p>

<p>As he hath followed you, with all despite.</p>

<p>Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard</p>

<p>Attend us through the city.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>Plebeians</span></p>

<p>Come, come, let’s see him out at gates! Come!</p>

<p>The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come!</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
