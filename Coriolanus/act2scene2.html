<p><center><i>[Enter two Officers, to lay cushions, as it were</p>

<p>in the Capitol.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span>  Come, come. They are almost here. How</p>

<p>many stand for consulships?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span>  Three, they say; but ’tis thought of</p>

<p>everyone Coriolanus will carry it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span>  That’s a brave fellow, but he’s vengeance</p>

<p>proud and loves not the common people.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span>  ’Faith, there hath been many great</p>

<p>men that have flattered the people who ne’er loved</p>

<p>them; and there be many that they have loved they</p>

<p>know not wherefore; so that, if they love they</p>

<p>know not why, they hate upon no better a ground.</p>

<p>Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether</p>

<p>they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge</p>

<p>he has in their disposition and, out of his noble</p>

<p>carelessness, lets them plainly see ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span>  If he did not care whether he had their</p>

<p>love or no, he waved indifferently ’twixt doing them</p>

<p>neither good nor harm; but he seeks their hate with</p>

<p>greater devotion than they can render it him and</p>

<p>leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him</p>

<p>their opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice</p>

<p>and displeasure of the people is as bad as that</p>

<p>which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span>  He hath deserved worthily of his</p>

<p>country, and his ascent is not by such easy degrees</p>

<p>as those who, having been supple and courteous to</p>

<p>the people, bonneted, without any further deed to</p>

<p>have them at all into their estimation and report;</p>

<p>but he hath so planted his honors in their eyes and</p>

<p>his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to</p>

<p>be silent and not confess so much were a kind of</p>

<p>ingrateful injury. To report otherwise were a malice</p>

<p>that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof</p>

<p>and rebuke from every ear that heard it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Officer</span>  No more of him; he’s a worthy man.</p>

<p>Make way. They are coming.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[A sennet. Enter the Patricians and the Tribunes of the</p>

<p>people, Lictors before them; Coriolanus, Menenius,</p>

<p>Cominius the consul. The Patricians sit. Sicinius</p>

<p>and Brutus take their places by themselves.</p>

<p>Coriolanus stands.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span></p>

<p>Having determined of the Volsces and</p>

<p>To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,</p>

<p>As the main point of this our after-meeting,</p>

<p>To gratify his noble service that</p>

<p>Hath thus stood for his country. Therefore please</p>

<p>you,</p>

<p>Most reverend and grave elders, to desire</p>

<p>The present consul and last general</p>

<p>In our well-found successes to report</p>

<p>A little of that worthy work performed</p>

<p>By Martius Caius Coriolanus, whom</p>

<p>We met here both to thank and to remember</p>

<p>With honors like himself.     <i><i>[Coriolanus sits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  Speak, good Cominius.</p>

<p>Leave nothing out for length, and make us think</p>

<p>Rather our state’s defective for requital,</p>

<p>Than we to stretch it out. <i>[(To the Tribunes.)]</i></p>

<p>Masters o’ th’ people,</p>

<p>We do request your kindest ears and, after,</p>

<p>Your loving motion toward the common body</p>

<p>To yield what passes here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  We are convented</p>

<p>Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts</p>

<p>Inclinable to honor and advance</p>

<p>The theme of our assembly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Which the rather</p>

<p>We shall be blest to do if he remember</p>

<p>A kinder value of the people than</p>

<p>He hath hereto prized them at.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  That’s off, that’s off!</p>

<p>I would you rather had been silent. Please you</p>

<p>To hear Cominius speak?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Most willingly,</p>

<p>But yet my caution was more pertinent</p>

<p>Than the rebuke you give it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  He loves your people,</p>

<p>But tie him not to be their bedfellow.–</p>

<p>Worthy Cominius, speak.</p>

<p><center><i>[Coriolanus rises and offers to go away.]</i></center></p>

<p>Nay, keep your place.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span></p>

<p>Sit, Coriolanus. Never shame to hear</p>

<p>What you have nobly done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Your Honors, pardon.</p>

<p>I had rather have my wounds to heal again</p>

<p>Than hear say how I got them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Sir, I hope</p>

<p>My words disbenched you not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  No, sir. Yet oft,</p>

<p>When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.</p>

<p>You soothed not, therefore hurt not; but your</p>

<p>people,</p>

<p>I love them as they weigh.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Pray now, sit down.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>I had rather have one scratch my head i’ th’ sun</p>

<p>When the alarum were struck than idly sit</p>

<p>To hear my nothings monstered.     <i><i>[Coriolanus exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Masters of the people,</p>

<p>Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter–</p>

<p>That’s thousand to one good one–when you now</p>

<p>see</p>

<p>He had rather venture all his limbs for honor</p>

<p>Than one on ’s ears to hear it.–Proceed, Cominius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span></p>

<p>I shall lack voice. The deeds of Coriolanus</p>

<p>Should not be uttered feebly. It is held</p>

<p>That valor is the chiefest virtue and</p>

<p>Most dignifies the haver; if it be,</p>

<p>The man I speak of cannot in the world</p>

<p>Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,</p>

<p>When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought</p>

<p>Beyond the mark of others. Our then dictator,</p>

<p>Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight</p>

<p>When with his Amazonian chin he drove</p>

<p>The bristled lips before him. He bestrid</p>

<p>An o’erpressed Roman and i’ th’ Consul’s view</p>

<p>Slew three opposers. Tarquin’s self he met</p>

<p>And struck him on his knee. In that day’s feats,</p>

<p>When he might act the woman in the scene,</p>

<p>He proved best man i’ th’ field and for his meed</p>

<p>Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age</p>

<p>Man-entered thus, he waxed like a sea,</p>

<p>And in the brunt of seventeen battles since</p>

<p>He lurched all swords of the garland. For this last,</p>

<p>Before and in Corioles, let me say,</p>

<p>I cannot speak him home. He stopped the flyers</p>

<p>And by his rare example made the coward</p>

<p>Turn terror into sport. As weeds before</p>

<p>A vessel under sail, so men obeyed</p>

<p>And fell below his stem. His sword, Death’s stamp,</p>

<p>Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot</p>

<p>He was a thing of blood, whose every motion</p>

<p>Was timed with dying cries. Alone he entered</p>

<p>The mortal gate o’ th’ city, which he painted</p>

<p>With shunless destiny; aidless came off</p>

<p>And with a sudden reinforcement struck</p>

<p>Corioles like a planet. Now all’s his,</p>

<p>When by and by the din of war gan pierce</p>

<p>His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit</p>

<p>Requickened what in flesh was fatigate,</p>

<p>And to the battle came he, where he did</p>

<p>Run reeking o’er the lives of men as if</p>

<p>’Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we called</p>

<p>Both field and city ours, he never stood</p>

<p>To ease his breast with panting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Worthy man!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span></p>

<p>He cannot but with measure fit the honors</p>

<p>Which we devise him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cominius</span>  Our spoils he kicked at</p>

<p>And looked upon things precious as they were</p>

<p>The common muck of the world. He covets less</p>

<p>Than misery itself would give, rewards</p>

<p>His deeds with doing them, and is content</p>

<p>To spend the time to end it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  He’s right noble.</p>

<p>Let him be called for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  Call Coriolanus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Officer</span>  He doth appear.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Coriolanus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span></p>

<p>The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased</p>

<p>To make thee consul.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  I do owe them still</p>

<p>My life and services.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  It then remains</p>

<p>That you do speak to the people.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  I do beseech you,</p>

<p>Let me o’erleap that custom, for I cannot</p>

<p>Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them</p>

<p>For my wounds’ sake to give their suffrage. Please</p>

<p>you</p>

<p>That I may pass this doing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Sir, the people</p>

<p>Must have their voices; neither will they bate</p>

<p>One jot of ceremony.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span> <i>[to Coriolanus]</i>  Put them not to ’t.</p>

<p>Pray you, go fit you to the custom, and</p>

<p>Take to you, as your predecessors have,</p>

<p>Your honor with your form.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  It is a part</p>

<p>That I shall blush in acting, and might well</p>

<p>Be taken from the people.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span> <i>[to Sicinius]</i>  Mark you that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>To brag unto them “Thus I did, and thus!”</p>

<p>Show them th’ unaching scars, which I should hide,</p>

<p>As if I had received them for the hire</p>

<p>Of their breath only!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Do not stand upon ’t.–</p>

<p>We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,</p>

<p>Our purpose to them, and to our noble consul</p>

<p>Wish we all joy and honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Senators</span></p>

<p>To Coriolanus come all joy and honor!</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish cornets. Then they exit. Sicinius and</p>

<p>Brutus remain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>You see how he intends to use the people.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span></p>

<p>May they perceive ’s intent! He will require them</p>

<p>As if he did contemn what he requested</p>

<p>Should be in them to give.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Come, we’ll inform them</p>

<p>Of our proceedings here. On th’ marketplace</p>

<p>I know they do attend us.</p>
