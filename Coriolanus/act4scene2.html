<p><center><i>[Enter the two Tribunes, Sicinius, and Brutus,</p>

<p>with the Aedile.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span></p>

<p>Bid them all home. He’s gone, and we’ll no further.</p>

<p>The nobility are vexed, whom we see have sided</p>

<p>In his behalf.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Now we have shown our power,</p>

<p>Let us seem humbler after it is done</p>

<p>Than when it was a-doing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Bid them home.</p>

<p>Say their great enemy is gone, and they</p>

<p>Stand in their ancient strength.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Dismiss them home.</p>

<p><center><i>[Aedile exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Here comes his mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and Menenius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Let’s not meet her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Why?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  They say she’s mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>They have ta’en note of us. Keep on your way.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>O, you’re well met. The hoarded plague o’ th’ gods</p>

<p>Requite your love!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Peace, peace! Be not so loud.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span> <i>[to the Tribunes]</i></p>

<p>If that I could for weeping, you should hear–</p>

<p>Nay, and you shall hear some. <i>[(To Sicinius.)]</i> Will</p>

<p>you be gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span> <i>[to Brutus]</i></p>

<p>You shall stay too. I would I had the power</p>

<p>To say so to my husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span> <i>[to Volumnia]</i>  Are you mankind?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>Ay, fool, is that a shame? Note but this, fool.</p>

<p>Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship</p>

<p>To banish him that struck more blows for Rome</p>

<p>Than thou hast spoken words?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  O blessed heavens!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>More noble blows than ever thou wise words,</p>

<p>And for Rome’s good. I’ll tell thee what–yet go.</p>

<p>Nay, but thou shalt stay too. I would my son</p>

<p>Were in Arabia and thy tribe before him,</p>

<p>His good sword in his hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  What then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Virgilia</span>  What then?</p>

<p>He’d make an end of thy posterity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Bastards and all.</p>

<p>Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Come, come, peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span></p>

<p>I would he had continued to his country</p>

<p>As he began, and not unknit himself</p>

<p>The noble knot he made.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  I would he had.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>“I would he had”? ’Twas you incensed the rabble.</p>

<p>Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth</p>

<p>As I can of those mysteries which heaven</p>

<p>Will not have Earth to know.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span> <i>[to Sicinius]</i>  Pray, let’s go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Now, pray, sir, get you gone.</p>

<p>You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:</p>

<p>As far as doth the Capitol exceed</p>

<p>The meanest house in Rome, so far my son–</p>

<p>This lady’s husband here, this, do you see?–</p>

<p>Whom you have banished, does exceed you all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Well, well, we’ll leave you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sicinius</span>  Why stay we to be baited</p>

<p>With one that wants her wits?     <i><i>[Tribunes exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span>  Take my prayers with</p>

<p>you.</p>

<p>I would the gods had nothing else to do</p>

<p>But to confirm my curses. Could I meet ’em</p>

<p>But once a day, it would unclog my heart</p>

<p>Of what lies heavy to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  You have told them home,</p>

<p>And, by my troth, you have cause. You’ll sup with</p>

<p>me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Volumnia</span></p>

<p>Anger’s my meat. I sup upon myself</p>

<p>And so shall starve with feeding.</p>

<p><i>[(To Virgilia.)]</i> Come, let’s go.</p>

<p>Leave this faint puling, and lament as I do,</p>

<p>In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.     <i><i>[They exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Fie, fie, fie!</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
