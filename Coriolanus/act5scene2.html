<p><center><i>[Enter Menenius to the Watch, or Guard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  Stay! Whence are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  Stand, and go back.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span></p>

<p>You guard like men; ’tis well. But by your leave,</p>

<p>I am an officer of state and come</p>

<p>To speak with Coriolanus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  From whence?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  From Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>You may not pass; you must return. Our general</p>

<p>Will no more hear from thence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>You’ll see your Rome embraced with fire before</p>

<p>You’ll speak with Coriolanus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Good my friends,</p>

<p>If you have heard your general talk of Rome</p>

<p>And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks</p>

<p>My name hath touched your ears. It is Menenius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>Be it so; go back. The virtue of your name</p>

<p>Is not here passable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  I tell thee, fellow,</p>

<p>Thy general is my lover. I have been</p>

<p>The book of his good acts, whence men have read</p>

<p>His fame unparalleled happily amplified;</p>

<p>For I have ever verified my friends–</p>

<p>Of whom he’s chief–with all the size that verity</p>

<p>Would without lapsing suffer. Nay, sometimes,</p>

<p>Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,</p>

<p>I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise</p>

<p>Have almost stamped the leasing. Therefore, fellow,</p>

<p>I must have leave to pass.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in</p>

<p>his behalf as you have uttered words in your own,</p>

<p>you should not pass here, no, though it were as virtuous</p>

<p>to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,</p>

<p>always factionary on the party of your</p>

<p>general.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  Howsoever you have been his liar, as</p>

<p>you say you have, I am one that, telling true under</p>

<p>him, must say you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Has he dined, can’st thou tell? For I would</p>

<p>not speak with him till after dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  You are a Roman, are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  I am, as thy general is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  Then you should hate Rome as he does.</p>

<p>Can you, when you have pushed out your gates the</p>

<p>very defender of them, and, in a violent popular</p>

<p>ignorance given your enemy your shield, think to</p>

<p>front his revenges with the easy groans of old</p>

<p>women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or</p>

<p>with the palsied intercession of such a decayed</p>

<p>dotant as you seem to be? Can you think to blow</p>

<p>out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in</p>

<p>with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived.</p>

<p>Therefore, back to Rome and prepare for</p>

<p>your execution. You are condemned. Our general</p>

<p>has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he</p>

<p>would use me with estimation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  Come, my captain knows you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  I mean thy general.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  My general cares not for you. Back, I say,</p>

<p>go, lest I let forth your half pint of blood. Back!</p>

<p>That’s the utmost of your having. Back!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  Nay, but fellow, fellow–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Coriolanus with Aufidius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span> <i>[to First Watch]</i>  Now, you companion, I’ll</p>

<p>say an errand for you. You shall know now that I</p>

<p>am in estimation; you shall perceive that a Jack</p>

<p>guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus.</p>

<p>Guess but by my entertainment with him</p>

<p>if thou stand’st not i’ th’ state of hanging or of some</p>

<p>death more long in spectatorship and crueler in</p>

<p>suffering; behold now presently, and swoon for</p>

<p>what’s to come upon thee. <i>[(To Coriolanus.)]</i> The</p>

<p>glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular</p>

<p>prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old</p>

<p>father Menenius does! O my son, my son! <i>[(He</p>

<p>weeps.)]</i> Thou art preparing fire for us; look thee,</p>

<p>here’s water to quench it. I was hardly moved to</p>

<p>come to thee; but being assured none but myself</p>

<p>could move thee, I have been blown out of your</p>

<p>gates with sighs, and conjure thee to pardon Rome</p>

<p>and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods</p>

<p>assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon</p>

<p>this varlet here, this, who, like a block, hath denied</p>

<p>my access to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>  Away!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  How? Away?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span></p>

<p>Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs</p>

<p>Are servanted to others. Though I owe</p>

<p>My revenge properly, my remission lies</p>

<p>In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,</p>

<p>Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather</p>

<p>Than pity note how much. Therefore, begone.</p>

<p>Mine ears against your suits are stronger than</p>

<p>Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,</p>

<p>Take this along; I writ it for thy sake,</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives Menenius a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,</p>

<p>I will not hear thee speak.–This man, Aufidius,</p>

<p>Was my beloved in Rome; yet thou behold’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aufidius</span>  You keep a constant temper.     <i><i>[They exit.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[The Guard and Menenius remain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  Now, sir, is your name Menenius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  ’Tis a spell, you see, of much power. You</p>

<p>know the way home again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  Do you hear how we are shent for keeping</p>

<p>your Greatness back?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  What cause do you think I have to</p>

<p>swoon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menenius</span>  I neither care for th’ world nor your general.</p>

<p>For such things as you, I can scarce think</p>

<p>there’s any, you’re so slight. He that hath a will to</p>

<p>die by himself fears it not from another. Let your</p>

<p>general do his worst. For you, be that you are,</p>

<p>long; and your misery increase with your age! I say</p>

<p>to you, as I was said to, away!     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  A noble fellow, I warrant him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  The worthy fellow is our general. He’s</p>

<p>the rock, the oak not to be wind-shaken.</p>

<p><center><i>[Watch exit.]</i></center></p>
