<p><center><i>[Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>Nurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,</p>

<p>I bade her come.–What, lamb! What, ladybird!</p>

<p>God forbid. Where’s this girl? What, Juliet!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Juliet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc>  How now, who calls?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc>  Your mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Madam, I am here. What is your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>This is the matter.–Nurse, give leave awhile.</p>

<p>We must talk in secret.–Nurse, come back again.</p>

<p>I have remembered me, thou ’s hear our counsel.</p>

<p>Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc>  She’s not fourteen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc>  I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth (and yet, to my teen</p>

<p>be it spoken, I have but four) she’s not fourteen.</p>

<p>How long is it now to Lammastide?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc>  A fortnight and odd days.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Even or odd, of all days in the year,</p>

<p>Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.</p>

<p>Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)</p>

<p>Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;</p>

<p>She was too good for me. But, as I said,</p>

<p>On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.</p>

<p>That shall she. Marry, I remember it well.</p>

<p>’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years,</p>

<p>And she was weaned (I never shall forget it)</p>

<p>Of all the days of the year, upon that day.</p>

<p>For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,</p>

<p>Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.</p>

<p>My lord and you were then at Mantua.</p>

<p>Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,</p>

<p>When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple</p>

<p>Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,</p>

<p>To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug.</p>

<p>“Shake,” quoth the dovehouse. ’Twas no need, I</p>

<p>trow,</p>

<p>To bid me trudge.</p>

<p>And since that time it is eleven years.</p>

<p>For then she could stand high-lone. Nay, by th’</p>

<p>rood,</p>

<p>She could have run and waddled all about,</p>

<p>For even the day before, she broke her brow,</p>

<p>And then my husband (God be with his soul,</p>

<p>He was a merry man) took up the child.</p>

<p>“Yea,” quoth he, “Dost thou fall upon thy face?</p>

<p>Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,</p>

<p>Wilt thou not, Jule?” And, by my holidam,</p>

<p>The pretty wretch left crying and said “Ay.”</p>

<p>To see now how a jest shall come about!</p>

<p>I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,</p>

<p>I never should forget it. “Wilt thou not, Jule?”</p>

<p>quoth he.</p>

<p>And, pretty fool, it stinted and said “Ay.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>Enough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh</p>

<p>To think it should leave crying and say “Ay.”</p>

<p>And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow</p>

<p>A bump as big as a young cock’rel’s stone,</p>

<p>A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.</p>

<p>“Yea,” quoth my husband. “Fall’st upon thy face?</p>

<p>Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age,</p>

<p>Wilt thou not, Jule?” It stinted and said “Ay.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>And stint thou, too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Peace. I have done. God mark thee to his grace,</p>

<p>Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nursed.</p>

<p>An I might live to see thee married once,</p>

<p>I have my wish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>Marry, that “marry” is the very theme</p>

<p>I came to talk of.–Tell me, daughter Juliet,</p>

<p>How stands your disposition to be married?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>It is an honor that I dream not of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>An honor? Were not I thine only nurse,</p>

<p>I would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy</p>

<p>teat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you</p>

<p>Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,</p>

<p>Are made already mothers. By my count</p>

<p>I was your mother much upon these years</p>

<p>That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief:</p>

<p>The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>A man, young lady–lady, such a man</p>

<p>As all the world–why, he’s a man of wax.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Nay, he’s a flower, in faith, a very flower.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>What say you? Can you love the gentleman?</p>

<p>This night you shall behold him at our feast.</p>

<p>Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,</p>

<p>And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.</p>

<p>Examine every married lineament</p>

<p>And see how one another lends content,</p>

<p>And what obscured in this fair volume lies</p>

<p>Find written in the margent of his eyes.</p>

<p>This precious book of love, this unbound lover,</p>

<p>To beautify him only lacks a cover.</p>

<p>The fish lives in the sea, and ’tis much pride</p>

<p>For fair without the fair within to hide.</p>

<p>That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory</p>

<p>That in gold clasps locks in the golden story.</p>

<p>So shall you share all that he doth possess</p>

<p>By having him, making yourself no less.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>No less? Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>Speak briefly. Can you like of Paris’ love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>I’ll look to like, if looking liking move.</p>

<p>But no more deep will I endart mine eye</p>

<p>Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servingman</sc>  Madam, the guests are come, supper</p>

<p>served up, you called, my young lady asked for, the</p>

<p>Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in</p>

<p>extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you,</p>

<p>follow straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>We follow thee.     <i><i>[Servingman exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Juliet, the County stays.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
