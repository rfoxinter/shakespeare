<br/>

<br/>

<p>Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,</p>

<p>And young affection gapes to be his heir.</p>

<p>That fair for which love groaned for and would die,</p>

<p>With tender Juliet matched, is now not fair.</p>

<p>Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,</p>

<p>Alike bewitched by the charm of looks,</p>

<p>But to his foe supposed he must complain,</p>

<p>And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks.</p>

<p>Being held a foe, he may not have access</p>

<p>To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,</p>

<p>And she as much in love, her means much less</p>

<p>To meet her new beloved anywhere.</p>

<p>But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,</p>

<p>Temp’ring extremities with extreme sweet.</p>
