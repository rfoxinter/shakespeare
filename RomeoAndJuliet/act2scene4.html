<p><center><i>[Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span></p>

<p>Where the devil should this Romeo be?</p>

<p>Came he not home tonight?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span></p>

<p>Not to his father’s. I spoke with his man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span></p>

<p>Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that</p>

<p>Rosaline,</p>

<p>Torments him so that he will sure run mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span></p>

<p>Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,</p>

<p>Hath sent a letter to his father’s house.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  A challenge, on my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span>  Romeo will answer it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Any man that can write may answer a letter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span>  Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how</p>

<p>he dares, being dared.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead,</p>

<p>stabbed with a white wench’s black eye, run</p>

<p>through the ear with a love-song, the very pin of his</p>

<p>heart cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt shaft. And</p>

<p>is he a man to encounter Tybalt?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span>  Why, what is Tybalt?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  More than prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous</p>

<p>captain of compliments. He fights as you sing</p>

<p>prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion.</p>

<p>He rests his minim rests, one, two, and the third in</p>

<p>your bosom–the very butcher of a silk button, a</p>

<p>duelist, a duelist, a gentleman of the very first house</p>

<p>of the first and second cause. Ah, the immortal</p>

<p>passado, the punto reverso, the hay!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span>  The what?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting</p>

<p>phantasimes, these new tuners of accent: “By</p>

<p>Jesu, a very good blade! A very tall man! A very good</p>

<p>whore!” Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire,</p>

<p>that we should be thus afflicted with these</p>

<p>strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these “pardon-me” ’s,</p>

<p>who stand so much on the new form</p>

<p>that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O their</p>

<p>bones, their bones!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Romeo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span>  Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Without his roe, like a dried herring. O</p>

<p>flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the</p>

<p>numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura to his lady</p>

<p>was a kitchen wench (marry, she had a better love</p>

<p>to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,</p>

<p>Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, Thisbe a gray</p>

<p>eye or so, but not to the purpose.–Signior Romeo,</p>

<p>bonjour. There’s a French salutation to your French</p>

<p>slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit</p>

<p>did I give you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was</p>

<p>great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain</p>

<p>courtesy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  That’s as much as to say such a case as</p>

<p>yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Meaning, to curtsy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Thou hast most kindly hit it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  A most courteous exposition.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  “Pink” for flower.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Right.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Why, then is my pump well flowered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Sure wit, follow me this jest now till thou</p>

<p>hast worn out thy pump, that when the single sole</p>

<p>of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing,</p>

<p>solely singular.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  O single-soled jest, solely singular for the</p>

<p>singleness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Come between us, good Benvolio. My wits</p>

<p>faints.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I’ll cry</p>

<p>a match.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I</p>

<p>am done, for thou hast more of the wild goose in</p>

<p>one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole</p>

<p>five. Was I with you there for the goose?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Thou wast never with me for anything when</p>

<p>thou wast not there for the goose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Nay, good goose, bite not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most</p>

<p>sharp sauce.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  And is it not, then, well served into a sweet</p>

<p>goose?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  O, here’s a wit of cheveril that stretches</p>

<p>from an inch narrow to an ell broad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  I stretch it out for that word “broad,” which</p>

<p>added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a</p>

<p>broad goose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Why, is not this better now than groaning</p>

<p>for love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou</p>

<p>Romeo, now art thou what thou art, by art as well as</p>

<p>by nature. For this driveling love is like a great</p>

<p>natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his</p>

<p>bauble in a hole.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span>  Stop there, stop there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against</p>

<p>the hair.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span>  Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  O, thou art deceived. I would have made it</p>

<p>short, for I was come to the whole depth of my tale</p>

<p>and meant indeed to occupy the argument no</p>

<p>longer.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Nurse and her man Peter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Here’s goodly gear. A sail, a sail!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Two, two–a shirt and a smock.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Peter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  Anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  My fan, Peter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Good Peter, to hide her face, for her fan’s</p>

<p>the fairer face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  God you good morrow, gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  God you good e’en, fair gentlewoman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Is it good e’en?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  ’Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of</p>

<p>the dial is now upon the prick of noon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Out upon you! What a man are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  One, gentlewoman, that God hath made, himself</p>

<p>to mar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  By my troth, it is well said: “for himself to</p>

<p>mar,” quoth he? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me</p>

<p>where I may find the young Romeo?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older</p>

<p>when you have found him than he was when you</p>

<p>sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for</p>

<p>fault of a worse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  You say well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’</p>

<p>faith, wisely, wisely.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span>  She will indite him to some supper.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  A bawd, a bawd, a bawd. So ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  What hast thou found?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  No hare, sir, unless a hare, sir, in a Lenten</p>

<p>pie that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.</p>

<p><i>[Singing.]</i>     <i>An old hare hoar,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And an old hare hoar,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Is very good meat in Lent.</i></p>

<p>     <i>But a hare that is hoar</i></p>

<p>     <i>Is too much for a score</i></p>

<p>        <i>When it hoars ere it be spent.</i></p>

<p>Romeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to</p>

<p>dinner thither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  I will follow you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell, lady, lady,</p>

<p>lady.     <i><i>[Mercutio and Benvolio exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this</p>

<p>that was so full of his ropery?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself</p>

<p>talk and will speak more in a minute than he will</p>

<p>stand to in a month.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  An he speak anything against me, I’ll take him</p>

<p>down, an he were lustier than he is, and twenty</p>

<p>such jacks. An if I cannot, I’ll find those that shall.</p>

<p>Scurvy knave, I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none</p>

<p>of his skains-mates. <i>[To Peter.]</i> And thou must stand</p>

<p>by too and suffer every knave to use me at his</p>

<p>pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had,</p>

<p>my weapon should quickly have been out. I warrant</p>

<p>you, I dare draw as soon as another man, if I</p>

<p>see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my</p>

<p>side.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part</p>

<p>about me quivers. Scurvy knave! <i>[To Romeo.]</i> Pray</p>

<p>you, sir, a word. And, as I told you, my young lady</p>

<p>bid me inquire you out. What she bid me say, I will</p>

<p>keep to myself. But first let me tell you, if you</p>

<p>should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they say, it</p>

<p>were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For</p>

<p>the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you</p>

<p>should deal double with her, truly it were an ill</p>

<p>thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very</p>

<p>weak dealing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.</p>

<p>I protest unto thee–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Good heart, and i’ faith I will tell her as much.</p>

<p>Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not</p>

<p>mark me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as</p>

<p>I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Bid her devise</p>

<p>Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,</p>

<p>And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell</p>

<p>Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.</p>

<p><center><i>[Offering her money.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  No, truly, sir, not a penny.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Go to, I say you shall.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.</p>

<p>Within this hour my man shall be with thee</p>

<p>And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,</p>

<p>Which to the high topgallant of my joy</p>

<p>Must be my convoy in the secret night.</p>

<p>Farewell. Be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains.</p>

<p>Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>Now, God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  What sayst thou, my dear nurse?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>Is your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say</p>

<p>“Two may keep counsel, putting one away”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Warrant thee, my man’s as true as steel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord,</p>

<p>Lord, when ’twas a little prating thing–O, there is</p>

<p>a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay</p>

<p>knife aboard, but she, good soul, had as lief see a</p>

<p>toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes</p>

<p>and tell her that Paris is the properer man, but I’ll</p>

<p>warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any</p>

<p>clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and</p>

<p>Romeo begin both with a letter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Ay, nurse, what of that? Both with an R.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Ah, mocker, that’s the dog’s name. R is for</p>

<p>the–No, I know it begins with some other letter,</p>

<p>and she hath the prettiest sententious of it, of you</p>

<p>and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Commend me to thy lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Ay, a thousand times.–Peter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  Anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Before and apace.</p>
