<p><center><i>[Enter Paris and his Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.</p>

<p>Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.</p>

<p>Under yond yew trees lay thee all along,</p>

<p>Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground.</p>

<p>So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread</p>

<p>(Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)</p>

<p>But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me</p>

<p>As signal that thou hearest something approach.</p>

<p>Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee. Go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I am almost afraid to stand alone</p>

<p>Here in the churchyard. Yet I will adventure.</p>

<p><center><i>[He moves away from Paris.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span> <i>[scattering flowers]</i></p>

<p>Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew</p>

<p>(O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones!)</p>

<p>Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,</p>

<p>Or, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans.</p>

<p>The obsequies that I for thee will keep</p>

<p>Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.</p>

<p><center><i>[Page whistles.]</i></center></p>

<p>The boy gives warning something doth approach.</p>

<p>What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,</p>

<p>To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?</p>

<p>What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.</p>

<p><center><i>[He steps aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Romeo and Balthasar.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.</p>

<p>Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning</p>

<p>See thou deliver it to my lord and father.</p>

<p>Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,</p>

<p>Whate’er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof</p>

<p>And do not interrupt me in my course.</p>

<p>Why I descend into this bed of death</p>

<p>Is partly to behold my lady’s face,</p>

<p>But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger</p>

<p>A precious ring, a ring that I must use</p>

<p>In dear employment. Therefore hence, begone.</p>

<p>But, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry</p>

<p>In what I farther shall intend to do,</p>

<p>By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint</p>

<p>And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.</p>

<p>The time and my intents are savage-wild,</p>

<p>More fierce and more inexorable far</p>

<p>Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span></p>

<p>I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.</p>

<p><center><i>[Giving money.]</i></center></p>

<p>Live and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.</p>

<p>His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.</p>

<p><center><i>[He steps aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span> <i>[beginning to force open the tomb]</i></p>

<p>Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,</p>

<p>Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,</p>

<p>Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,</p>

<p>And in despite I’ll cram thee with more food.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>This is that banished haughty Montague</p>

<p>That murdered my love’s cousin, with which grief</p>

<p>It is supposed the fair creature died,</p>

<p>And here is come to do some villainous shame</p>

<p>To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.</p>

<p><center><i>[Stepping forward.]</i></center></p>

<p>Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague.</p>

<p>Can vengeance be pursued further than death?</p>

<p>Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.</p>

<p>Obey and go with me, for thou must die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.</p>

<p>Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp’rate man.</p>

<p>Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone.</p>

<p>Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,</p>

<p>Put not another sin upon my head</p>

<p>By urging me to fury. O, begone!</p>

<p>By heaven, I love thee better than myself,</p>

<p>For I come hither armed against myself.</p>

<p>Stay not, begone, live, and hereafter say</p>

<p>A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>I do defy thy commination</p>

<p>And apprehend thee for a felon here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!</p>

<p><center><i>[They draw and fight.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span></p>

<p>O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,</p>

<p>Open the tomb; lay me with Juliet.     <i><i>[He dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>In faith, I will.–Let me peruse this face.</p>

<p>Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!</p>

<p>What said my man when my betossed soul</p>

<p>Did not attend him as we rode? I think</p>

<p>He told me Paris should have married Juliet.</p>

<p>Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?</p>

<p>Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,</p>

<p>To think it was so?–O, give me thy hand,</p>

<p>One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book!</p>

<p>I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.–</p>

<p><center><i>[He opens the tomb.]</i></center></p>

<p>A grave? O, no. A lantern, slaughtered youth,</p>

<p>For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes</p>

<p>This vault a feasting presence full of light.–</p>

<p>Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interred.</p>

<p><center><i>[Laying Paris in the tomb.]</i></center></p>

<p>How oft when men are at the point of death</p>

<p>Have they been merry, which their keepers call</p>

<p>A light’ning before death! O, how may I</p>

<p>Call this a light’ning?–O my love, my wife,</p>

<p>Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,</p>

<p>Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.</p>

<p>Thou art not conquered. Beauty’s ensign yet</p>

<p>Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,</p>

<p>And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.–</p>

<p>Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?</p>

<p>O, what more favor can I do to thee</p>

<p>Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain</p>

<p>To sunder his that was thine enemy?</p>

<p>Forgive me, cousin.–Ah, dear Juliet,</p>

<p>Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe</p>

<p>That unsubstantial death is amorous,</p>

<p>And that the lean abhorred monster keeps</p>

<p>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?</p>

<p>For fear of that I still will stay with thee</p>

<p>And never from this palace of dim night</p>

<p>Depart again. Here, here will I remain</p>

<p>With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here</p>

<p>Will I set up my everlasting rest</p>

<p>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars</p>

<p>From this world-wearied flesh! Eyes, look your last.</p>

<p>Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O, you</p>

<p>The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss</p>

<p>A dateless bargain to engrossing death.</p>

<p><center><i>[Kissing Juliet.]</i></center></p>

<p>Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide!</p>

<p>Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on</p>

<p>The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!</p>

<p>Here’s to my love. <i>[Drinking.]</i> O true apothecary,</p>

<p>Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.</p>

<p><center><i>[He dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Friar Lawrence with lantern, crow, and spade.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span></p>

<p>Saint Francis be my speed! How oft tonight</p>

<p>Have my old feet stumbled at graves!–Who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span></p>

<p>Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span></p>

<p>Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,</p>

<p>What torch is yond that vainly lends his light</p>

<p>To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,</p>

<p>It burneth in the Capels’ monument.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span></p>

<p>It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,</p>

<p>One that you love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span>  Who is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span>  Romeo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span></p>

<p>How long hath he been there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span>  Full half an hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span></p>

<p>Go with me to the vault.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span>  I dare not, sir.</p>

<p>My master knows not but I am gone hence,</p>

<p>And fearfully did menace me with death</p>

<p>If I did stay to look on his intents.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span></p>

<p>Stay, then. I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.</p>

<p>O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span></p>

<p>As I did sleep under this yew tree here,</p>

<p>I dreamt my master and another fought,</p>

<p>And that my master slew him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span> <i>[moving toward the tomb]</i></p>

<p>Romeo!–</p>

<p>Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains</p>

<p>The stony entrance of this sepulcher?</p>

<p>What mean these masterless and gory swords</p>

<p>To lie discolored by this place of peace?</p>

<p>Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?</p>

<p>And steeped in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour</p>

<p>Is guilty of this lamentable chance!</p>

<p>The lady stirs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>O comfortable friar, where is my lord?</p>

<p>I do remember well where I should be,</p>

<p>And there I am. Where is my Romeo?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span></p>

<p>I hear some noise.–Lady, come from that nest</p>

<p>Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.</p>

<p>A greater power than we can contradict</p>

<p>Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.</p>

<p>Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,</p>

<p>And Paris, too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee</p>

<p>Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.</p>

<p>Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.</p>

<p>Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>What’s here? A cup closed in my true love’s hand?</p>

<p>Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.–</p>

<p>O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop</p>

<p>To help me after! I will kiss thy lips.</p>

<p>Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,</p>

<p>To make me die with a restorative.     <i><i>[She kisses him.]</i></i></p>

<p>Thy lips are warm!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Paris’s Page and Watch.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>  Lead, boy. Which way?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O, happy dagger,</p>

<p>This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.</p>

<p><center><i>[She takes Romeo’s dagger, stabs herself, and dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span></p>

<p>This is the place, there where the torch doth burn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>The ground is bloody.–Search about the</p>

<p>churchyard.</p>

<p>Go, some of you; whoe’er you find, attach.</p>

<p><center><i>[Some watchmen exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,</p>

<p>And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,</p>

<p>Who here hath lain this two days buried.–</p>

<p>Go, tell the Prince. Run to the Capulets.</p>

<p>Raise up the Montagues. Some others search.</p>

<p><center><i>[Others exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,</p>

<p>But the true ground of all these piteous woes</p>

<p>We cannot without circumstance descry.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Watchmen with Romeo’s man Balthasar.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the</p>

<p>churchyard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Friar Lawrence and another Watchman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.</p>

<p>We took this mattock and this spade from him</p>

<p>As he was coming from this churchyard’s side.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Prince with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>What misadventure is so early up</p>

<p>That calls our person from our morning rest?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Capulet and Lady Capulet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>O, the people in the street cry “Romeo,”</p>

<p>Some “Juliet,” and some “Paris,” and all run</p>

<p>With open outcry toward our monument.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>What fear is this which startles in our ears?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,</p>

<p>And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,</p>

<p>Warm and new killed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>Search, seek, and know how this foul murder</p>

<p>comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watch</span></p>

<p>Here is a friar, and slaughtered Romeo’s man,</p>

<p>With instruments upon them fit to open</p>

<p>These dead men’s tombs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!</p>

<p>This dagger hath mista’en, for, lo, his house</p>

<p>Is empty on the back of Montague,</p>

<p>And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>O me, this sight of death is as a bell</p>

<p>That warns my old age to a sepulcher.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Montague.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>Come, Montague, for thou art early up</p>

<p>To see thy son and heir now early down.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montague</span></p>

<p>Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.</p>

<p>Grief of my son’s exile hath stopped her breath.</p>

<p>What further woe conspires against mine age?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Look, and thou shalt see.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montague</span> <i>[seeing Romeo dead]</i></p>

<p>O thou untaught! What manners is in this,</p>

<p>To press before thy father to a grave?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>Seal up the mouth of outrage for awhile,</p>

<p>Till we can clear these ambiguities</p>

<p>And know their spring, their head, their true</p>

<p>descent,</p>

<p>And then will I be general of your woes</p>

<p>And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,</p>

<p>And let mischance be slave to patience.–</p>

<p>Bring forth the parties of suspicion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span></p>

<p>I am the greatest, able to do least,</p>

<p>Yet most suspected, as the time and place</p>

<p>Doth make against me, of this direful murder.</p>

<p>And here I stand, both to impeach and purge</p>

<p>Myself condemned and myself excused.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>Then say at once what thou dost know in this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span></p>

<p>I will be brief, for my short date of breath</p>

<p>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</p>

<p>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,</p>

<p>And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.</p>

<p>I married them, and their stol’n marriage day</p>

<p>Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death</p>

<p>Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city,</p>

<p>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</p>

<p>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</p>

<p>Betrothed and would have married her perforce</p>

<p>To County Paris. Then comes she to me,</p>

<p>And with wild looks bid me devise some mean</p>

<p>To rid her from this second marriage,</p>

<p>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</p>

<p>Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)</p>

<p>A sleeping potion, which so took effect</p>

<p>As I intended, for it wrought on her</p>

<p>The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo</p>

<p>That he should hither come as this dire night</p>

<p>To help to take her from her borrowed grave,</p>

<p>Being the time the potion’s force should cease.</p>

<p>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</p>

<p>Was stayed by accident, and yesternight</p>

<p>Returned my letter back. Then all alone</p>

<p>At the prefixed hour of her waking</p>

<p>Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,</p>

<p>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell</p>

<p>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.</p>

<p>But when I came, some minute ere the time</p>

<p>Of her awakening, here untimely lay</p>

<p>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</p>

<p>She wakes, and I entreated her come forth</p>

<p>And bear this work of heaven with patience.</p>

<p>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,</p>

<p>And she, too desperate, would not go with me</p>

<p>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</p>

<p>All this I know, and to the marriage</p>

<p>Her nurse is privy. And if aught in this</p>

<p>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</p>

<p>Be sacrificed some hour before his time</p>

<p>Unto the rigor of severest law.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>We still have known thee for a holy man.–</p>

<p>Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span></p>

<p>I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,</p>

<p>And then in post he came from Mantua</p>

<p>To this same place, to this same monument.</p>

<p>This letter he early bid me give his father</p>

<p>And threatened me with death, going in the vault,</p>

<p>If I departed not and left him there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>Give me the letter. I will look on it.–</p>

<p><center><i>[He takes Romeo’s letter.]</i></center></p>

<p>Where is the County’s page, that raised the</p>

<p>watch?–</p>

<p>Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span></p>

<p>He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave</p>

<p>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.</p>

<p>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,</p>

<p>And by and by my master drew on him,</p>

<p>And then I ran away to call the watch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,</p>

<p>Their course of love, the tidings of her death;</p>

<p>And here he writes that he did buy a poison</p>

<p>Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal</p>

<p>Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.</p>

<p>Where be these enemies?–Capulet, Montague,</p>

<p>See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</p>

<p>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love,</p>

<p>And I, for winking at your discords too,</p>

<p>Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>O brother Montague, give me thy hand.</p>

<p>This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more</p>

<p>Can I demand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montague</span>  But I can give thee more,</p>

<p>For I will ray her statue in pure gold,</p>

<p>That whiles Verona by that name is known,</p>

<p>There shall no figure at such rate be set</p>

<p>As that of true and faithful Juliet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,</p>

<p>Poor sacrifices of our enmity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>A glooming peace this morning with it brings.</p>

<p>The sun for sorrow will not show his head.</p>

<p>Go hence to have more talk of these sad things.</p>

<p>Some shall be pardoned, and some punished.</p>

<p>For never was a story of more woe</p>

<p>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</p>
