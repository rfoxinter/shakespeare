<p><center><i>[Servingmen come forth with napkins.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc>  Where’s Potpan that he helps not</p>

<p>to take away? He shift a trencher? He scrape a</p>

<p>trencher?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc>  When good manners shall lie</p>

<p>all in one or two men’s hands, and they unwashed</p>

<p>too, ’tis a foul thing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc>  Away with the joint stools, remove</p>

<p>the court cupboard, look to the plate.–</p>

<p>Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as</p>

<p>thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone</p>

<p>and Nell.–Anthony and Potpan!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc>  Ay, boy, ready.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc>  You are looked for and called for,</p>

<p>asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc>  We cannot be here and there too.</p>

<p>Cheerly, boys! Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver</p>

<p>take all.     <i><i>[They move aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Capulet and his household, all the guests and</p>

<p>gentlewomen to Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, and the</p>

<p>other Maskers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>Welcome, gentlemen. Ladies that have their toes</p>

<p>Unplagued with corns will walk a bout with</p>

<p>you.–</p>

<p>Ah, my mistresses, which of you all</p>

<p>Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,</p>

<p>She, I’ll swear, hath corns. Am I come near you</p>

<p>now?–</p>

<p>Welcome, gentlemen. I have seen the day</p>

<p>That I have worn a visor and could tell</p>

<p>A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,</p>

<p>Such as would please. ’Tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone.</p>

<p>You are welcome, gentlemen.–Come, musicians,</p>

<p>play.     <i><i>[Music plays and they dance.]</i></i></p>

<p>A hall, a hall, give room!–And foot it, girls.–</p>

<p>More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up,</p>

<p>And quench the fire; the room is grown too hot.–</p>

<p>Ah, sirrah, this unlooked-for sport comes well.–</p>

<p>Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,</p>

<p>For you and I are past our dancing days.</p>

<p>How long is ’t now since last yourself and I</p>

<p>Were in a mask?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet’s</sc> <sc>Cousin</sc>  By ’r Lady, thirty years.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much.</p>

<p>’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,</p>

<p>Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,</p>

<p>Some five and twenty years, and then we masked.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet’s</sc> <sc>Cousin</sc></p>

<p>’Tis more, ’tis more. His son is elder, sir.</p>

<p>His son is thirty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet</sc>  Will you tell me that?</p>

<p>His son was but a ward two years ago.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc> <i>[to a Servingman]</i></p>

<p>What lady’s that which doth enrich the hand</p>

<p>Of yonder knight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servingman</sc>  I know not, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!</p>

<p>It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night</p>

<p>As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear–</p>

<p>Beauty too rich for use, for Earth too dear.</p>

<p>So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows</p>

<p>As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.</p>

<p>The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand</p>

<p>And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.</p>

<p>Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight,</p>

<p>For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc></p>

<p>This, by his voice, should be a Montague.–</p>

<p>Fetch me my rapier, boy.     <i><i>[Page exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>What, dares the slave</p>

<p>Come hither covered with an antic face</p>

<p>To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?</p>

<p>Now, by the stock and honor of my kin,</p>

<p>To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc></p>

<p>Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,</p>

<p>A villain that is hither come in spite</p>

<p>To scorn at our solemnity this night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>Young Romeo is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc>  ’Tis he, that villain Romeo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>Content thee, gentle coz. Let him alone.</p>

<p>He bears him like a portly gentleman,</p>

<p>And, to say truth, Verona brags of him</p>

<p>To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.</p>

<p>I would not for the wealth of all this town</p>

<p>Here in my house do him disparagement.</p>

<p>Therefore be patient. Take no note of him.</p>

<p>It is my will, the which if thou respect,</p>

<p>Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,</p>

<p>An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc></p>

<p>It fits when such a villain is a guest.</p>

<p>I’ll not endure him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet</sc>  He shall be endured.</p>

<p>What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to.</p>

<p>Am I the master here or you? Go to.</p>

<p>You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,</p>

<p>You’ll make a mutiny among my guests,</p>

<p>You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc></p>

<p>Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet</sc>  Go to, go to.</p>

<p>You are a saucy boy. Is ’t so indeed?</p>

<p>This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.</p>

<p>You must contrary me. Marry, ’tis time–</p>

<p>Well said, my hearts.–You are a princox, go.</p>

<p>Be quiet, or–More light, more light!–for shame,</p>

<p>I’ll make you quiet.–What, cheerly, my hearts!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc></p>

<p>Patience perforce with willful choler meeting</p>

<p>Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.</p>

<p>I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall,</p>

<p>Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt’rest gall.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc> <i>[taking Juliet’s hand]</i></p>

<p>If I profane with my unworthiest hand</p>

<p>This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this:</p>

<p>My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand</p>

<p>To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,</p>

<p>Which mannerly devotion shows in this;</p>

<p>For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,</p>

<p>And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>O then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.</p>

<p>They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kisses her.]</i></center></p>

<p>Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Then have my lips the sin that they have took.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged!</p>

<p>Give me my sin again.     <i><i>[He kisses her.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc>  You kiss by th’ book.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Madam, your mother craves a word with you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Juliet moves toward her mother.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>What is her mother?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc>  Marry, bachelor,</p>

<p>Her mother is the lady of the house,</p>

<p>And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.</p>

<p>I nursed her daughter that you talked withal.</p>

<p>I tell you, he that can lay hold of her</p>

<p>Shall have the chinks.     <i><i>[Nurse moves away.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Is she a Capulet?</p>

<p>O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Away, begone. The sport is at the best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.</p>

<p>We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.–</p>

<p>Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all.</p>

<p>I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.–</p>

<p>More torches here.–Come on then, let’s to bed.–</p>

<p>Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late.</p>

<p>I’ll to my rest.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Juliet and the Nurse begin to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>The son and heir of old Tiberio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>What’s he that now is going out of door?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc>  I know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Go ask his name. <i>[The Nurse goes.]</i> If he be married,</p>

<p>My grave is like to be my wedding bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc> <i>[returning]</i></p>

<p>His name is Romeo, and a Montague,</p>

<p>The only son of your great enemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>My only love sprung from my only hate!</p>

<p>Too early seen unknown, and known too late!</p>

<p>Prodigious birth of love it is to me</p>

<p>That I must love a loathed enemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>What’s this? What’s this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc>  A rhyme I learned even now</p>

<p>Of one I danced withal.</p>

<p><center><i>[One calls within “Juliet.”]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc>  Anon, anon.</p>

<p>Come, let’s away. The strangers all are gone.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
