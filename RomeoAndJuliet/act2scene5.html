<p><center><i>[Enter Juliet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.</p>

<p>In half an hour she promised to return.</p>

<p>Perchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.</p>

<p>O, she is lame! Love’s heralds should be thoughts,</p>

<p>Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,</p>

<p>Driving back shadows over louring hills.</p>

<p>Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw Love,</p>

<p>And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.</p>

<p>Now is the sun upon the highmost hill</p>

<p>Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve</p>

<p>Is three long hours, yet she is not come.</p>

<p>Had she affections and warm youthful blood,</p>

<p>She would be as swift in motion as a ball;</p>

<p>My words would bandy her to my sweet love,</p>

<p>And his to me.</p>

<p>But old folks, many feign as they were dead,</p>

<p>Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Nurse and Peter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O God, she comes!–O, honey nurse, what news?</p>

<p>Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc>  Peter, stay at the gate.     <i><i>[Peter exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Now, good sweet nurse–O Lord, why lookest thou</p>

<p>sad?</p>

<p>Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.</p>

<p>If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news</p>

<p>By playing it to me with so sour a face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>I am aweary. Give me leave awhile.</p>

<p>Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.</p>

<p>Nay, come, I pray thee, speak. Good, good nurse,</p>

<p>speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?</p>

<p>Do you not see that I am out of breath?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath</p>

<p>To say to me that thou art out of breath?</p>

<p>The excuse that thou dost make in this delay</p>

<p>Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.</p>

<p>Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.</p>

<p>Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.</p>

<p>Let me be satisfied; is ’t good or bad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc>  Well, you have made a simple choice. You know</p>

<p>not how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he.</p>

<p>Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his leg</p>

<p>excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot and a</p>

<p>body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they</p>

<p>are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy,</p>

<p>but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy</p>

<p>ways, wench. Serve God. What, have you dined at</p>

<p>home?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>No, no. But all this did I know before.</p>

<p>What says he of our marriage? What of that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!</p>

<p>It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.</p>

<p>My back o’ t’ other side! Ah, my back, my back!</p>

<p>Beshrew your heart for sending me about</p>

<p>To catch my death with jaunting up and down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>I’ faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.</p>

<p>Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my</p>

<p>love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc>  Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a</p>

<p>courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I</p>

<p>warrant, a virtuous–Where is your mother?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Where is my mother? Why, she is within.</p>

<p>Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest:</p>

<p>“Your love says, like an honest gentleman,</p>

<p>Where is your mother?”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc>  O God’s lady dear,</p>

<p>Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.</p>

<p>Is this the poultice for my aching bones?</p>

<p>Henceforward do your messages yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Have you got leave to go to shrift today?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc>  I have.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell.</p>

<p>There stays a husband to make you a wife.</p>

<p>Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks;</p>

<p>They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.</p>

<p>Hie you to church. I must another way,</p>

<p>To fetch a ladder by the which your love</p>

<p>Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.</p>

<p>I am the drudge and toil in your delight,</p>

<p>But you shall bear the burden soon at night.</p>

<p>Go. I’ll to dinner. Hie you to the cell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.</p>
