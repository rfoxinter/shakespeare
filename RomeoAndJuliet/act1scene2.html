<p><center><i>[Enter Capulet, County Paris, and a Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>But Montague is bound as well as I,</p>

<p>In penalty alike, and ’tis not hard, I think,</p>

<p>For men so old as we to keep the peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>Of honorable reckoning are you both,</p>

<p>And pity ’tis you lived at odds so long.</p>

<p>But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>But saying o’er what I have said before.</p>

<p>My child is yet a stranger in the world.</p>

<p>She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.</p>

<p>Let two more summers wither in their pride</p>

<p>Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>Younger than she are happy mothers made.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>And too soon marred are those so early made.</p>

<p>Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;</p>

<p>She’s the hopeful lady of my earth.</p>

<p>But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;</p>

<p>My will to her consent is but a part.</p>

<p>And, she agreed, within her scope of choice</p>

<p>Lies my consent and fair according voice.</p>

<p>This night I hold an old accustomed feast,</p>

<p>Whereto I have invited many a guest</p>

<p>Such as I love; and you among the store,</p>

<p>One more, most welcome, makes my number more.</p>

<p>At my poor house look to behold this night</p>

<p>Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.</p>

<p>Such comfort as do lusty young men feel</p>

<p>When well-appareled April on the heel</p>

<p>Of limping winter treads, even such delight</p>

<p>Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night</p>

<p>Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,</p>

<p>And like her most whose merit most shall be;</p>

<p>Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,</p>

<p>May stand in number, though in reck’ning none.</p>

<p>Come go with me.     <i><i>[To Servingman, giving him a list.]</i></i></p>

<p>Go, sirrah, trudge about</p>

<p>Through fair Verona, find those persons out</p>

<p>Whose names are written there, and to them say</p>

<p>My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.</p>

<p><center><i>[Capulet and Paris exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Find them out whose names are written</p>

<p>here! It is written that the shoemaker should</p>

<p>meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the</p>

<p>fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.</p>

<p>But I am sent to find those persons whose names</p>

<p>are here writ, and can never find what names the</p>

<p>writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned.</p>

<p>In good time!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Benvolio and Romeo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span> <i>[to Romeo]</i></p>

<p>Tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning;</p>

<p>One pain is lessened by another’s anguish.</p>

<p>Turn giddy, and be helped by backward turning.</p>

<p>One desperate grief cures with another’s languish.</p>

<p>Take thou some new infection to thy eye,</p>

<p>And the rank poison of the old will die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span></p>

<p>For what, I pray thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  For your broken shin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span>  Why Romeo, art thou mad?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Not mad, but bound more than a madman is,</p>

<p>Shut up in prison, kept without my food,</p>

<p>Whipped and tormented, and–good e’en, good</p>

<p>fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  God gi’ good e’en. I pray, sir, can you</p>

<p>read?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Perhaps you have learned it without</p>

<p>book. But I pray, can you read anything you see?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Ay, if I know the letters and the language.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  You say honestly. Rest you merry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Stay, fellow. I can read.     <i><i>[(He reads the letter.)]</i></i></p>

<p>Signior Martino and his wife and daughters,</p>

<p>County Anselme and his beauteous sisters,</p>

<p>The lady widow of Vitruvio,</p>

<p>Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces,</p>

<p>Mercutio and his brother Valentine,</p>

<p>Mine Uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters,</p>

<p>My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,</p>

<p>Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt,</p>

<p>Lucio and the lively Helena.</p>

<p>A fair assembly. Whither should they come?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Whither? To supper?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  To our house.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Whose house?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  My master’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Indeed I should have asked thee that before.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  Now I’ll tell you without asking. My</p>

<p>master is the great rich Capulet, and, if you be not</p>

<p>of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a</p>

<p>cup of wine. Rest you merry.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span></p>

<p>At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s</p>

<p>Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves,</p>

<p>With all the admired beauties of Verona.</p>

<p>Go thither, and with unattainted eye</p>

<p>Compare her face with some that I shall show,</p>

<p>And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>When the devout religion of mine eye</p>

<p>Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;</p>

<p>And these who, often drowned, could never die,</p>

<p>Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.</p>

<p>One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun</p>

<p>Ne’er saw her match since first the world begun.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span></p>

<p>Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,</p>

<p>Herself poised with herself in either eye;</p>

<p>But in that crystal scales let there be weighed</p>

<p>Your lady’s love against some other maid</p>

<p>That I will show you shining at this feast,</p>

<p>And she shall scant show well that now seems best.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,</p>

<p>But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.</p>
