<p><center><i>[Enter Juliet alone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,</p>

<p>Towards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a wagoner</p>

<p>As Phaeton would whip you to the west</p>

<p>And bring in cloudy night immediately.</p>

<p>Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,</p>

<p>That runaways’ eyes may wink, and Romeo</p>

<p>Leap to these arms, untalked of and unseen.</p>

<p>Lovers can see to do their amorous rites</p>

<p>By their own beauties, or, if love be blind,</p>

<p>It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,</p>

<p>Thou sober-suited matron all in black,</p>

<p>And learn me how to lose a winning match</p>

<p>Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.</p>

<p>Hood my unmanned blood, bating in my cheeks,</p>

<p>With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,</p>

<p>Think true love acted simple modesty.</p>

<p>Come, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day in</p>

<p>night,</p>

<p>For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night</p>

<p>Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.</p>

<p>Come, gentle night; come, loving black-browed</p>

<p>night,</p>

<p>Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,</p>

<p>Take him and cut him out in little stars,</p>

<p>And he will make the face of heaven so fine</p>

<p>That all the world will be in love with night</p>

<p>And pay no worship to the garish sun.</p>

<p>O, I have bought the mansion of a love</p>

<p>But not possessed it, and, though I am sold,</p>

<p>Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day</p>

<p>As is the night before some festival</p>

<p>To an impatient child that hath new robes</p>

<p>And may not wear them.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Nurse with cords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O, here comes my nurse,</p>

<p>And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks</p>

<p>But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.–</p>

<p>Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? The</p>

<p>cords</p>

<p>That Romeo bid thee fetch?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc>  Ay, ay, the cords.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dropping the rope ladder.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Ah weraday, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!</p>

<p>We are undone, lady, we are undone.</p>

<p>Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s killed, he’s dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Can heaven be so envious?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc>  Romeo can,</p>

<p>Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo,</p>

<p>Whoever would have thought it? Romeo!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?</p>

<p>This torture should be roared in dismal hell.</p>

<p>Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but “Ay,”</p>

<p>And that bare vowel “I” shall poison more</p>

<p>Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.</p>

<p>I am not I if there be such an “I,”</p>

<p>Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer “Ay.”</p>

<p>If he be slain, say “Ay,” or if not, “No.”</p>

<p>Brief sounds determine my weal or woe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>I saw the wound. I saw it with mine eyes</p>

<p>(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast–</p>

<p>A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse,</p>

<p>Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaubed in blood,</p>

<p>All in gore blood. I swooned at the sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>O break, my heart, poor bankrout, break at once!</p>

<p>To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.</p>

<p>Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,</p>

<p>And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!</p>

<p>O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman,</p>

<p>That ever I should live to see thee dead!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>What storm is this that blows so contrary?</p>

<p>Is Romeo slaughtered and is Tybalt dead?</p>

<p>My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?</p>

<p>Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom,</p>

<p>For who is living if those two are gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished.</p>

<p>Romeo that killed him–he is banished.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>O God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>It did, it did, alas the day, it did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>O serpent heart hid with a flow’ring face!</p>

<p>Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?</p>

<p>Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical!</p>

<p>Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!</p>

<p>Despised substance of divinest show!</p>

<p>Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,</p>

<p>A damned saint, an honorable villain.</p>

<p>O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell</p>

<p>When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend</p>

<p>In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?</p>

<p>Was ever book containing such vile matter</p>

<p>So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell</p>

<p>In such a gorgeous palace!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc>  There’s no trust,</p>

<p>No faith, no honesty in men. All perjured,</p>

<p>All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.</p>

<p>Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.</p>

<p>These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me</p>

<p>old.</p>

<p>Shame come to Romeo!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc>  Blistered be thy tongue</p>

<p>For such a wish! He was not born to shame.</p>

<p>Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit,</p>

<p>For ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned</p>

<p>Sole monarch of the universal Earth.</p>

<p>O, what a beast was I to chide at him!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?</p>

<p>Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy</p>

<p>name</p>

<p>When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?</p>

<p>But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?</p>

<p>That villain cousin would have killed my husband.</p>

<p>Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;</p>

<p>Your tributary drops belong to woe,</p>

<p>Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.</p>

<p>My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,</p>

<p>And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my</p>

<p>husband.</p>

<p>All this is comfort. Wherefore weep I then?</p>

<p>Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,</p>

<p>That murdered me. I would forget it fain,</p>

<p>But, O, it presses to my memory</p>

<p>Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds:</p>

<p>“Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished.”</p>

<p>That “banished,” that one word “banished,”</p>

<p>Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death</p>

<p>Was woe enough if it had ended there;</p>

<p>Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship</p>

<p>And needly will be ranked with other griefs,</p>

<p>Why followed not, when she said “Tybalt’s dead,”</p>

<p>“Thy father” or “thy mother,” nay, or both,</p>

<p>Which modern lamentation might have moved?</p>

<p>But with a rearward following Tybalt’s death,</p>

<p>“Romeo is banished.” To speak that word</p>

<p>Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,</p>

<p>All slain, all dead. “Romeo is banished.”</p>

<p>There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,</p>

<p>In that word’s death. No words can that woe sound.</p>

<p>Where is my father and my mother, nurse?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.</p>

<p>Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be</p>

<p>spent,</p>

<p>When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.–</p>

<p>Take up those cords.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Nurse picks up the rope ladder.]</i></center></p>

<p>Poor ropes, you are beguiled,</p>

<p>Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled.</p>

<p>He made you for a highway to my bed,</p>

<p>But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.</p>

<p>Come, cords–come, nurse. I’ll to my wedding bed,</p>

<p>And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Hie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo</p>

<p>To comfort you. I wot well where he is.</p>

<p>Hark you, your Romeo will be here at night.</p>

<p>I’ll to him. He is hid at Lawrence’ cell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>O, find him!     <i><i>[Giving the Nurse a ring.]</i></i></p>

<p>Give this ring to my true knight</p>

<p>And bid him come to take his last farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
