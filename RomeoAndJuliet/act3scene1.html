<p><center><i>[Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and their men.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire.</p>

<p>The day is hot, the Capels are abroad,</p>

<p>And if we meet we shall not ’scape a brawl,</p>

<p>For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc>  Thou art like one of these fellows that, when</p>

<p>he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his</p>

<p>sword upon the table and says “God send me no</p>

<p>need of thee” and, by the operation of the second</p>

<p>cup, draws him on the drawer when indeed there is</p>

<p>no need.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc>  Am I like such a fellow?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc>  Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy</p>

<p>mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be</p>

<p>moody, and as soon moody to be moved.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc>  And what to?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc>  Nay, an there were two such, we should</p>

<p>have none shortly, for one would kill the other.</p>

<p>Thou–why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that</p>

<p>hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than</p>

<p>thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking</p>

<p>nuts, having no other reason but because thou</p>

<p>hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy</p>

<p>out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as</p>

<p>an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been</p>

<p>beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast</p>

<p>quarreled with a man for coughing in the street</p>

<p>because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain</p>

<p>asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor</p>

<p>for wearing his new doublet before Easter? With</p>

<p>another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?</p>

<p>And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc>  An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any</p>

<p>man should buy the fee simple of my life for an</p>

<p>hour and a quarter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc>  The fee simple? O simple!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Tybalt, Petruchio, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc>  By my head, here comes the Capulets.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc>  By my heel, I care not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc> <i>[to his companions]</i></p>

<p>Follow me close, for I will speak to them.–</p>

<p>Gentlemen, good e’en. A word with one of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc>  And but one word with one of us? Couple it</p>

<p>with something. Make it a word and a blow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc>  You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an</p>

<p>you will give me occasion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc>  Could you not take some occasion without</p>

<p>giving?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc>  Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc>  Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels?</p>

<p>An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear</p>

<p>nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick; here’s</p>

<p>that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>We talk here in the public haunt of men.</p>

<p>Either withdraw unto some private place,</p>

<p>Or reason coldly of your grievances,</p>

<p>Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc></p>

<p>Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.</p>

<p>I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Romeo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc></p>

<p>Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc></p>

<p>But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.</p>

<p>Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower.</p>

<p>Your Worship in that sense may call him “man.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc></p>

<p>Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford</p>

<p>No better term than this: thou art a villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee</p>

<p>Doth much excuse the appertaining rage</p>

<p>To such a greeting. Villain am I none.</p>

<p>Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc></p>

<p>Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries</p>

<p>That thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>I do protest I never injured thee</p>

<p>But love thee better than thou canst devise</p>

<p>Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.</p>

<p>And so, good Capulet, which name I tender</p>

<p>As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc></p>

<p>O calm, dishonorable, vile submission!</p>

<p>Alla stoccato carries it away.     <i><i>[He draws.]</i></i></p>

<p>Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc>  What wouldst thou have with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc>  Good king of cats, nothing but one of your</p>

<p>nine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as</p>

<p>you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the</p>

<p>eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher</p>

<p>by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your</p>

<p>ears ere it be out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc>  I am for you.     <i><i>[He draws.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc>  Come, sir, your passado.     <i><i>[They fight.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Draw, Benvolio, beat down their weapons.</p>

<p><center><i>[Romeo draws.]</i></center></p>

<p>Gentlemen, for shame forbear this outrage!</p>

<p>Tybalt! Mercutio! The Prince expressly hath</p>

<p>Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.</p>

<p>Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!</p>

<p><center><i>[Romeo attempts to beat down their rapiers.</p>

<p>Tybalt stabs Mercutio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc>  Away, Tybalt!</p>

<p><center><i>[Tybalt, Petruchio, and their followers exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc>  I am hurt.</p>

<p>A plague o’ both houses! I am sped.</p>

<p>Is he gone and hath nothing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc>  What, art thou hurt?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc></p>

<p>Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.</p>

<p>Where is my page?–Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.</p>

<p><center><i>[Page exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Courage, man, the hurt cannot be much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc>  No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as</p>

<p>a church door, but ’tis enough. ’Twill serve. Ask for</p>

<p>me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I</p>

<p>am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’</p>

<p>both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a</p>

<p>cat, to scratch a man to death! A braggart, a rogue, a</p>

<p>villain that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the</p>

<p>devil came you between us? I was hurt under your</p>

<p>arm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc>  I thought all for the best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mercutio</sc></p>

<p>Help me into some house, Benvolio,</p>

<p>Or I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses!</p>

<p>They have made worms’ meat of me.</p>

<p>I have it, and soundly, too. Your houses!</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Romeo exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,</p>

<p>My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt</p>

<p>In my behalf. My reputation stained</p>

<p>With Tybalt’s slander–Tybalt, that an hour</p>

<p>Hath been my cousin! O sweet Juliet,</p>

<p>Thy beauty hath made me effeminate</p>

<p>And in my temper softened valor’s steel.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Benvolio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead.</p>

<p>That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,</p>

<p>Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>This day’s black fate on more days doth depend.</p>

<p>This but begins the woe others must end.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Tybalt.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain!</p>

<p>Away to heaven, respective lenity,</p>

<p>And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.–</p>

<p>Now, Tybalt, take the “villain” back again</p>

<p>That late thou gavest me, for Mercutio’s soul</p>

<p>Is but a little way above our heads,</p>

<p>Staying for thine to keep him company.</p>

<p>Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc></p>

<p>Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here</p>

<p>Shalt with him hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc>  This shall determine that.</p>

<p><center><i>[They fight. Tybalt falls.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Romeo, away, begone!</p>

<p>The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.</p>

<p>Stand not amazed. The Prince will doom thee death</p>

<p>If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>O, I am Fortune’s fool!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc>  Why dost thou stay?</p>

<p><center><i>[Romeo exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Citizens.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizen</sc></p>

<p>Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?</p>

<p>Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>There lies that Tybalt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizen</sc> <i>[to Tybalt]</i>  Up, sir, go with me.</p>

<p>I charge thee in the Prince’s name, obey.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Prince, old Montague, Capulet, their Wives and all.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Where are the vile beginners of this fray?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>O noble prince, I can discover all</p>

<p>The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.</p>

<p>There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,</p>

<p>That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother’s child!</p>

<p>O prince! O cousin! Husband! O, the blood is spilled</p>

<p>Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,</p>

<p>For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.</p>

<p>O cousin, cousin!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay–</p>

<p>Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink</p>

<p>How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal</p>

<p>Your high displeasure. All this uttered</p>

<p>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed</p>

<p>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen</p>

<p>Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts</p>

<p>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,</p>

<p>Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point</p>

<p>And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats</p>

<p>Cold death aside and with the other sends</p>

<p>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity</p>

<p>Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud</p>

<p>“Hold, friends! Friends, part!” and swifter than his</p>

<p>tongue</p>

<p>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,</p>

<p>And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm</p>

<p>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life</p>

<p>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.</p>

<p>But by and by comes back to Romeo,</p>

<p>Who had but newly entertained revenge,</p>

<p>And to ’t they go like lightning, for ere I</p>

<p>Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain,</p>

<p>And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.</p>

<p>This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>He is a kinsman to the Montague.</p>

<p>Affection makes him false; he speaks not true.</p>

<p>Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,</p>

<p>And all those twenty could but kill one life.</p>

<p>I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give.</p>

<p>Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.</p>

<p>Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montague</sc></p>

<p>Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio’s friend.</p>

<p>His fault concludes but what the law should end,</p>

<p>The life of Tybalt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  And for that offense</p>

<p>Immediately we do exile him hence.</p>

<p>I have an interest in your hearts’ proceeding:</p>

<p>My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.</p>

<p>But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine</p>

<p>That you shall all repent the loss of mine.</p>

<p>I will be deaf to pleading and excuses.</p>

<p>Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.</p>

<p>Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,</p>

<p>Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.</p>

<p>Bear hence this body and attend our will.</p>

<p>Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit, the Capulet men</p>
