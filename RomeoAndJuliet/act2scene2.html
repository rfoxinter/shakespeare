<p><center><i>[Romeo comes forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>He jests at scars that never felt a wound.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Juliet above.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?</p>

<p>It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.</p>

<p>Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,</p>

<p>Who is already sick and pale with grief</p>

<p>That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.</p>

<p>Be not her maid since she is envious.</p>

<p>Her vestal livery is but sick and green,</p>

<p>And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.</p>

<p>It is my lady. O, it is my love!</p>

<p>O, that she knew she were!</p>

<p>She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?</p>

<p>Her eye discourses; I will answer it.</p>

<p>I am too bold. ’Tis not to me she speaks.</p>

<p>Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,</p>

<p>Having some business, do entreat her eyes</p>

<p>To twinkle in their spheres till they return.</p>

<p>What if her eyes were there, they in her head?</p>

<p>The brightness of her cheek would shame those</p>

<p>stars</p>

<p>As daylight doth a lamp; her eye in heaven</p>

<p>Would through the airy region stream so bright</p>

<p>That birds would sing and think it were not night.</p>

<p>See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.</p>

<p>O, that I were a glove upon that hand,</p>

<p>That I might touch that cheek!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span>  Ay me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span> <i>[aside]</i>  She speaks.</p>

<p>O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art</p>

<p>As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,</p>

<p>As is a winged messenger of heaven</p>

<p>Unto the white-upturned wond’ring eyes</p>

<p>Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him</p>

<p>When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds</p>

<p>And sails upon the bosom of the air.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?</p>

<p>Deny thy father and refuse thy name,</p>

<p>Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,</p>

<p>And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>’Tis but thy name that is my enemy.</p>

<p>Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.</p>

<p>What’s Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,</p>

<p>Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name</p>

<p>Belonging to a man.</p>

<p>What’s in a name? That which we call a rose</p>

<p>By any other word would smell as sweet.</p>

<p>So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,</p>

<p>Retain that dear perfection which he owes</p>

<p>Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,</p>

<p>And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,</p>

<p>Take all myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  I take thee at thy word.</p>

<p>Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptized.</p>

<p>Henceforth I never will be Romeo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night,</p>

<p>So stumblest on my counsel?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  By a name</p>

<p>I know not how to tell thee who I am.</p>

<p>My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself</p>

<p>Because it is an enemy to thee.</p>

<p>Had I it written, I would tear the word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words</p>

<p>Of thy tongue’s uttering, yet I know the sound.</p>

<p>Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?</p>

<p>The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,</p>

<p>And the place death, considering who thou art,</p>

<p>If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,</p>

<p>For stony limits cannot hold love out,</p>

<p>And what love can do, that dares love attempt.</p>

<p>Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye</p>

<p>Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,</p>

<p>And I am proof against their enmity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>I would not for the world they saw thee here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,</p>

<p>And, but thou love me, let them find me here.</p>

<p>My life were better ended by their hate</p>

<p>Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>By whose direction found’st thou out this place?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.</p>

<p>He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.</p>

<p>I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far</p>

<p>As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,</p>

<p>I should adventure for such merchandise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,</p>

<p>Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek</p>

<p>For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.</p>

<p>Fain would I dwell on form; fain, fain deny</p>

<p>What I have spoke. But farewell compliment.</p>

<p>Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say “Ay,”</p>

<p>And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,</p>

<p>Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,</p>

<p>They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,</p>

<p>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.</p>

<p>Or, if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,</p>

<p>I’ll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,</p>

<p>So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.</p>

<p>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,</p>

<p>And therefore thou mayst think my havior light.</p>

<p>But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true</p>

<p>Than those that have more coying to be strange.</p>

<p>I should have been more strange, I must confess,</p>

<p>But that thou overheard’st ere I was ware</p>

<p>My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,</p>

<p>And not impute this yielding to light love,</p>

<p>Which the dark night hath so discovered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,</p>

<p>That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>O, swear not by the moon, th’ inconstant moon,</p>

<p>That monthly changes in her circled orb,</p>

<p>Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>What shall I swear by?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span>  Do not swear at all.</p>

<p>Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,</p>

<p>Which is the god of my idolatry,</p>

<p>And I’ll believe thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  If my heart’s dear love–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,</p>

<p>I have no joy of this contract tonight.</p>

<p>It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,</p>

<p>Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be</p>

<p>Ere one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night.</p>

<p>This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,</p>

<p>May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.</p>

<p>Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest</p>

<p>Come to thy heart as that within my breast.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Th’ exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>I gave thee mine before thou didst request it,</p>

<p>And yet I would it were to give again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>But to be frank and give it thee again.</p>

<p>And yet I wish but for the thing I have.</p>

<p>My bounty is as boundless as the sea,</p>

<p>My love as deep. The more I give to thee,</p>

<p>The more I have, for both are infinite.</p>

<p><center><i>[Nurse calls from within.]</i></center></p>

<p>I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.–</p>

<p>Anon, good nurse.–Sweet Montague, be true.</p>

<p>Stay but a little; I will come again.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,</p>

<p>Being in night, all this is but a dream,</p>

<p>Too flattering sweet to be substantial.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Reenter Juliet above.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.</p>

<p>If that thy bent of love be honorable,</p>

<p>Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,</p>

<p>By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,</p>

<p>Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,</p>

<p>And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay</p>

<p>And follow thee my lord throughout the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span> <i>[within]</i>  Madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>I come anon.–But if thou meanest not well,</p>

<p>I do beseech thee–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span> <i>[within]</i>  Madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span>  By and by, I come.–</p>

<p>To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will I send.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  So thrive my soul–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span>  A thousand times good night.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>A thousand times the worse to want thy light.</p>

<p>Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their</p>

<p>books,</p>

<p>But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.</p>

<p><center><i>[Going.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Juliet above again.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Hist, Romeo, hist! O, for a falc’ner’s voice</p>

<p>To lure this tassel-gentle back again!</p>

<p>Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,</p>

<p>Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies</p>

<p>And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine</p>

<p>With repetition of “My Romeo!”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>It is my soul that calls upon my name.</p>

<p>How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,</p>

<p>Like softest music to attending ears.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Romeo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  My dear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span>  What o’clock tomorrow</p>

<p>Shall I send to thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  By the hour of nine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>I will not fail. ’Tis twenty year till then.</p>

<p>I have forgot why I did call thee back.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Let me stand here till thou remember it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,</p>

<p>Rememb’ring how I love thy company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,</p>

<p>Forgetting any other home but this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>’Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone,</p>

<p>And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,</p>

<p>That lets it hop a little from his hand,</p>

<p>Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,</p>

<p>And with a silken thread plucks it back again,</p>

<p>So loving-jealous of his liberty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>I would I were thy bird.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span>  Sweet, so would I.</p>

<p>Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.</p>

<p>Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet</p>

<p>sorrow</p>

<p>That I shall say “Good night” till it be morrow.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.</p>

<p>Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest.</p>

<p>Hence will I to my ghostly friar’s close cell,</p>

<p>His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
