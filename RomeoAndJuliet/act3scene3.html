<p><center><i>[Enter Friar Lawrence.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.</p>

<p>Affliction is enamored of thy parts,</p>

<p>And thou art wedded to calamity.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Romeo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?</p>

<p>What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand</p>

<p>That I yet know not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc>  Too familiar</p>

<p>Is my dear son with such sour company.</p>

<p>I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>A gentler judgment vanished from his lips:</p>

<p>Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say “death,”</p>

<p>For exile hath more terror in his look,</p>

<p>Much more than death. Do not say “banishment.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>Here from Verona art thou banished.</p>

<p>Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>There is no world without Verona walls</p>

<p>But purgatory, torture, hell itself.</p>

<p>Hence “banished” is “banished from the world,”</p>

<p>And world’s exile is death. Then “banished”</p>

<p>Is death mistermed. Calling death “banished,”</p>

<p>Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden ax</p>

<p>And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!</p>

<p>Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince,</p>

<p>Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the law</p>

<p>And turned that black word “death” to</p>

<p>“banishment.”</p>

<p>This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>’Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here</p>

<p>Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog</p>

<p>And little mouse, every unworthy thing,</p>

<p>Live here in heaven and may look on her,</p>

<p>But Romeo may not. More validity,</p>

<p>More honorable state, more courtship lives</p>

<p>In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize</p>

<p>On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand</p>

<p>And steal immortal blessing from her lips,</p>

<p>Who even in pure and vestal modesty</p>

<p>Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;</p>

<p>But Romeo may not; he is banished.</p>

<p>Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.</p>

<p>They are free men, but I am banished.</p>

<p>And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?</p>

<p>Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground</p>

<p>knife,</p>

<p>No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,</p>

<p>But “banished” to kill me? “Banished”?</p>

<p>O friar, the damned use that word in hell.</p>

<p>Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,</p>

<p>Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,</p>

<p>A sin absolver, and my friend professed,</p>

<p>To mangle me with that word “banished”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>I’ll give thee armor to keep off that word,</p>

<p>Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,</p>

<p>To comfort thee, though thou art banished.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Yet “banished”? Hang up philosophy.</p>

<p>Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,</p>

<p>Displant a town, reverse a prince’s doom,</p>

<p>It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>O, then I see that madmen have no ears.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>How should they when that wise men have no eyes?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.</p>

<p>Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,</p>

<p>An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,</p>

<p>Doting like me, and like me banished,</p>

<p>Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy</p>

<p>hair</p>

<p>And fall upon the ground as I do now,</p>

<p><center><i>[Romeo throws himself down.]</i></center></p>

<p>Taking the measure of an unmade grave.</p>

<p><center><i>[Knock within.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>Arise. One knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans,</p>

<p>Mistlike, enfold me from the search of eyes.</p>

<p><center><i>[Knock.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>Hark, how they knock!–Who’s there?–Romeo,</p>

<p>arise.</p>

<p>Thou wilt be taken.–Stay awhile.–Stand up.</p>

<p><center><i>[Knock.]</i></center></p>

<p>Run to my study.–By and by.–God’s will,</p>

<p>What simpleness is this?–I come, I come.</p>

<p><center><i>[Knock.]</i></center></p>

<p>Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What’s</p>

<p>your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.</p>

<p>I come from Lady Juliet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc> <i>[admitting the Nurse]</i></p>

<p>Welcome, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Nurse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,</p>

<p>Where’s my lady’s lord? Where’s Romeo?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>There on the ground, with his own tears made</p>

<p>drunk.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>O, he is even in my mistress’ case,</p>

<p>Just in her case. O woeful sympathy!</p>

<p>Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,</p>

<p>Blubb’ring and weeping, weeping and blubb’ring.–</p>

<p>Stand up, stand up. Stand an you be a man.</p>

<p>For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.</p>

<p>Why should you fall into so deep an O?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc>  Nurse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Ah sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc> <i>[rising up]</i></p>

<p>Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?</p>

<p>Doth not she think me an old murderer,</p>

<p>Now I have stained the childhood of our joy</p>

<p>With blood removed but little from her own?</p>

<p>Where is she? And how doth she? And what says</p>

<p>My concealed lady to our canceled love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps,</p>

<p>And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,</p>

<p>And “Tybalt” calls, and then on Romeo cries,</p>

<p>And then down falls again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc>  As if that name,</p>

<p>Shot from the deadly level of a gun,</p>

<p>Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand</p>

<p>Murdered her kinsman.–O, tell me, friar, tell me,</p>

<p>In what vile part of this anatomy</p>

<p>Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack</p>

<p>The hateful mansion.     <i><i>[He draws his dagger.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc>  Hold thy desperate hand!</p>

<p>Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.</p>

<p>Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote</p>

<p>The unreasonable fury of a beast.</p>

<p>Unseemly woman in a seeming man,</p>

<p>And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!</p>

<p>Thou hast amazed me. By my holy order,</p>

<p>I thought thy disposition better tempered.</p>

<p>Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself,</p>

<p>And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,</p>

<p>By doing damned hate upon thyself?</p>

<p>Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth,</p>

<p>Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet</p>

<p>In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose?</p>

<p>Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,</p>

<p>Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all</p>

<p>And usest none in that true use indeed</p>

<p>Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.</p>

<p>Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,</p>

<p>Digressing from the valor of a man;</p>

<p>Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,</p>

<p>Killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish;</p>

<p>Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,</p>

<p>Misshapen in the conduct of them both,</p>

<p>Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,</p>

<p>Is set afire by thine own ignorance,</p>

<p>And thou dismembered with thine own defense.</p>

<p>What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,</p>

<p>For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead:</p>

<p>There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,</p>

<p>But thou slewest Tybalt: there art thou happy.</p>

<p>The law that threatened death becomes thy friend</p>

<p>And turns it to exile: there art thou happy.</p>

<p>A pack of blessings light upon thy back;</p>

<p>Happiness courts thee in her best array;</p>

<p>But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,</p>

<p>Thou pouts upon thy fortune and thy love.</p>

<p>Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.</p>

<p>Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed.</p>

<p>Ascend her chamber. Hence and comfort her.</p>

<p>But look thou stay not till the watch be set,</p>

<p>For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,</p>

<p>Where thou shalt live till we can find a time</p>

<p>To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,</p>

<p>Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back</p>

<p>With twenty hundred thousand times more joy</p>

<p>Than thou went’st forth in lamentation.–</p>

<p>Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,</p>

<p>And bid her hasten all the house to bed,</p>

<p>Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.</p>

<p>Romeo is coming.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>O Lord, I could have stayed here all the night</p>

<p>To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!–</p>

<p>My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nurse</sc></p>

<p>Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[Nurse gives Romeo a ring.]</i></center></p>

<p>Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>How well my comfort is revived by this!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>Go hence, good night–and here stands all your</p>

<p>state:</p>

<p>Either be gone before the watch be set</p>

<p>Or by the break of day disguised from hence.</p>

<p>Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,</p>

<p>And he shall signify from time to time</p>

<p>Every good hap to you that chances here.</p>

<p>Give me thy hand. ’Tis late. Farewell. Good night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>But that a joy past joy calls out on me,</p>

<p>It were a grief so brief to part with thee.</p>

<p>Farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
