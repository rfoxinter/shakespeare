<p><center><i>[Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other</p>

<p>Maskers, Torchbearers, and a Boy with a drum.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?</p>

<p>Or shall we on without apology?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span></p>

<p>The date is out of such prolixity.</p>

<p>We’ll have no Cupid hoodwinked with a scarf,</p>

<p>Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,</p>

<p>Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper,</p>

<p>Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke</p>

<p>After the prompter, for our entrance.</p>

<p>But let them measure us by what they will.</p>

<p>We’ll measure them a measure and be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.</p>

<p>Being but heavy I will bear the light.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span></p>

<p>Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes</p>

<p>With nimble soles. I have a soul of lead</p>

<p>So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span></p>

<p>You are a lover. Borrow Cupid’s wings</p>

<p>And soar with them above a common bound.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>I am too sore enpierced with his shaft</p>

<p>To soar with his light feathers, and so bound</p>

<p>I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.</p>

<p>Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span></p>

<p>And to sink in it should you burden love–</p>

<p>Too great oppression for a tender thing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,</p>

<p>Too rude, too boist’rous, and it pricks like thorn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span></p>

<p>If love be rough with you, be rough with love.</p>

<p>Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.–</p>

<p>Give me a case to put my visage in.–</p>

<p>A visor for a visor. What care I</p>

<p>What curious eye doth cote deformities?</p>

<p>Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span></p>

<p>Come, knock and enter, and no sooner in</p>

<p>But every man betake him to his legs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>A torch for me. Let wantons light of heart</p>

<p>Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,</p>

<p>For I am proverbed with a grandsire phrase:</p>

<p>I’ll be a candle holder and look on;</p>

<p>The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span></p>

<p>Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word.</p>

<p>If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire–</p>

<p>Or, save your reverence, love–wherein thou</p>

<p>stickest</p>

<p>Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Nay, that’s not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  I mean, sir, in delay</p>

<p>We waste our lights; in vain, light lights by day.</p>

<p>Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits</p>

<p>Five times in that ere once in our five wits.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>And we mean well in going to this masque,</p>

<p>But ’tis no wit to go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  Why, may one ask?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>I dreamt a dream tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  And so did I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Well, what was yours?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  That dreamers often lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>In bed asleep while they do dream things true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span></p>

<p>O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.</p>

<p>She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes</p>

<p>In shape no bigger than an agate stone</p>

<p>On the forefinger of an alderman,</p>

<p>Drawn with a team of little atomi</p>

<p>Over men’s noses as they lie asleep.</p>

<p>Her wagon spokes made of long spinners’ legs,</p>

<p>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,</p>

<p>Her traces of the smallest spider web,</p>

<p>Her collars of the moonshine’s wat’ry beams,</p>

<p>Her whip of cricket’s bone, the lash of film,</p>

<p>Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,</p>

<p>Not half so big as a round little worm</p>

<p>Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.</p>

<p>Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,</p>

<p>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,</p>

<p>Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.</p>

<p>And in this state she gallops night by night</p>

<p>Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;</p>

<p>On courtiers’ knees, that dream on cur’sies straight;</p>

<p>O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;</p>

<p>O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,</p>

<p>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues</p>

<p>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.</p>

<p>Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,</p>

<p>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.</p>

<p>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,</p>

<p>Tickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep;</p>

<p>Then he dreams of another benefice.</p>

<p>Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,</p>

<p>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</p>

<p>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</p>

<p>Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon</p>

<p>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes</p>

<p>And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two</p>

<p>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</p>

<p>That plats the manes of horses in the night</p>

<p>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,</p>

<p>Which once untangled much misfortune bodes.</p>

<p>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</p>

<p>That presses them and learns them first to bear,</p>

<p>Making them women of good carriage.</p>

<p>This is she–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.</p>

<p>Thou talk’st of nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mercutio</span>  True, I talk of dreams,</p>

<p>Which are the children of an idle brain,</p>

<p>Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,</p>

<p>Which is as thin of substance as the air</p>

<p>And more inconstant than the wind, who woos</p>

<p>Even now the frozen bosom of the north</p>

<p>And, being angered, puffs away from thence,</p>

<p>Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span></p>

<p>This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.</p>

<p>Supper is done, and we shall come too late.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>I fear too early, for my mind misgives</p>

<p>Some consequence yet hanging in the stars</p>

<p>Shall bitterly begin his fearful date</p>

<p>With this night’s revels, and expire the term</p>

<p>Of a despised life closed in my breast</p>

<p>By some vile forfeit of untimely death.</p>

<p>But he that hath the steerage of my course</p>

<p>Direct my sail. On, lusty gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benvolio</span>  Strike, drum.</p>

<p><center><i>[They march about the stage</p>

<p>and then withdraw to the side.]</i></center></p>
