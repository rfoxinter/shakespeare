<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span> <i>[approaching the bed]</i></p>

<p>Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet!–Fast, I warrant</p>

<p>her, she–</p>

<p>Why, lamb, why, lady! Fie, you slugabed!</p>

<p>Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!–</p>

<p>What, not a word?–You take your pennyworths</p>

<p>now.</p>

<p>Sleep for a week, for the next night, I warrant,</p>

<p>The County Paris hath set up his rest</p>

<p>That you shall rest but little.–God forgive me,</p>

<p>Marry, and amen! How sound is she asleep!</p>

<p>I needs must wake her.–Madam, madam, madam!</p>

<p>Ay, let the County take you in your bed,</p>

<p>He’ll fright you up, i’ faith.–Will it not be?</p>

<p><center><i>[She opens the bed’s curtains.]</i></center></p>

<p>What, dressed, and in your clothes, and down</p>

<p>again?</p>

<p>I must needs wake you. Lady, lady, lady!–</p>

<p>Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead.–</p>

<p>O, weraday, that ever I was born!–</p>

<p>Some aqua vitae, ho!–My lord! My lady!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lady Capulet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>What noise is here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  O lamentable day!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>What is the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Look, look!–O heavy day!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>O me! O me! My child, my only life,</p>

<p>Revive, look up, or I will die with thee.</p>

<p>Help, help! Call help.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Capulet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>For shame, bring Juliet forth. Her lord is come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>She’s dead, deceased. She’s dead, alack the day!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Ha, let me see her! Out, alas, she’s cold.</p>

<p>Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff.</p>

<p>Life and these lips have long been separated.</p>

<p>Death lies on her like an untimely frost</p>

<p>Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>O lamentable day!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span>  O woeful time!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,</p>

<p>Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Friar Lawrence and the County Paris, with</p>

<p>Musicians.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span></p>

<p>Come, is the bride ready to go to church?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Ready to go, but never to return.–</p>

<p>O son, the night before thy wedding day</p>

<p>Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,</p>

<p>Flower as she was, deflowered by him.</p>

<p>Death is my son-in-law; Death is my heir.</p>

<p>My daughter he hath wedded. I will die</p>

<p>And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>Have I thought long to see this morning’s face,</p>

<p>And doth it give me such a sight as this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!</p>

<p>Most miserable hour that e’er time saw</p>

<p>In lasting labor of his pilgrimage!</p>

<p>But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,</p>

<p>But one thing to rejoice and solace in,</p>

<p>And cruel death hath catched it from my sight!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>O woe, O woeful, woeful, woeful day!</p>

<p>Most lamentable day, most woeful day</p>

<p>That ever, ever I did yet behold!</p>

<p>O day, O day, O day, O hateful day!</p>

<p>Never was seen so black a day as this!</p>

<p>O woeful day, O woeful day!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!</p>

<p>Most detestable death, by thee beguiled,</p>

<p>By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown!</p>

<p>O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!</p>

<p>Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now</p>

<p>To murder, murder our solemnity?</p>

<p>O child! O child! My soul and not my child!</p>

<p>Dead art thou! Alack, my child is dead,</p>

<p>And with my child my joys are buried.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span></p>

<p>Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion’s cure lives not</p>

<p>In these confusions. Heaven and yourself</p>

<p>Had part in this fair maid. Now heaven hath all,</p>

<p>And all the better is it for the maid.</p>

<p>Your part in her you could not keep from death,</p>

<p>But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.</p>

<p>The most you sought was her promotion,</p>

<p>For ’twas your heaven she should be advanced;</p>

<p>And weep you now, seeing she is advanced</p>

<p>Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?</p>

<p>O, in this love you love your child so ill</p>

<p>That you run mad, seeing that she is well.</p>

<p>She’s not well married that lives married long,</p>

<p>But she’s best married that dies married young.</p>

<p>Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary</p>

<p>On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,</p>

<p>And in her best array, bear her to church,</p>

<p>For though fond nature bids us all lament,</p>

<p>Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>All things that we ordained festival</p>

<p>Turn from their office to black funeral:</p>

<p>Our instruments to melancholy bells,</p>

<p>Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,</p>

<p>Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,</p>

<p>Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,</p>

<p>And all things change them to the contrary.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span> <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span></p>

<p>Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,</p>

<p>And go, Sir Paris. Everyone prepare</p>

<p>To follow this fair corse unto her grave.</p>

<p>The heavens do lour upon you for some ill.</p>

<p>Move them no more by crossing their high will.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but the Nurse and the Musicians exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Musician</span></p>

<p>Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,</p>

<p>For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Musician</span></p>

<p>Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.</p>

<p><center><i>[Nurse exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Peter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  Musicians, O musicians, “Heart’s ease,”</p>

<p>“Heart’s ease.” O, an you will have me live, play</p>

<p>“Heart’s ease.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Musician</span>  Why “Heart’s ease?”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  O musicians, because my heart itself plays “My</p>

<p>heart is full.” O, play me some merry dump to</p>

<p>comfort me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Musician</span>  Not a dump, we. ’Tis no time to play</p>

<p>now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  You will not then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Musician</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  I will then give it you soundly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Musician</span>  What will you give us?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give</p>

<p>you the minstrel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Musician</span>  Then will I give you the</p>

<p>serving-creature.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  Then will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on</p>

<p>your pate. I will carry no crochets. I’ll re you, I’ll fa</p>

<p>you. Do you note me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Musician</span>  An you re us and fa us, you note us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Musician</span>  Pray you, put up your dagger and</p>

<p>put out your wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat</p>

<p>you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger.</p>

<p>Answer me like men.</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>When griping griefs the heart doth wound</i></p>

<p>     <i>And doleful dumps the mind oppress,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Then music with her silver sound–</i></p>

<p>Why “silver sound”? Why “music with her silver</p>

<p>sound”? What say you, Simon Catling?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Musician</span>  Marry, sir, because silver hath a</p>

<p>sweet sound.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  Prates.–What say you, Hugh Rebeck?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Musician</span>  I say “silver sound” because musicians</p>

<p>sound for silver.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  Prates too.–What say you, James Soundpost?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Musician</span>  Faith, I know not what to say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  O, I cry you mercy. You are the singer. I will say</p>

<p>for you. It is “music with her silver sound” because</p>

<p>musicians have no gold for sounding:</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>Then music with her silver sound</i></p>

<p>     <i>With speedy help doth lend redress.</i></p>
