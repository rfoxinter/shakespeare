<p><center><i>[Enter Romeo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,</p>

<p>My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.</p>

<p>My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne,</p>

<p>And all this day an unaccustomed spirit</p>

<p>Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.</p>

<p>I dreamt my lady came and found me dead</p>

<p>(Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to</p>

<p>think!)</p>

<p>And breathed such life with kisses in my lips</p>

<p>That I revived and was an emperor.</p>

<p>Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed</p>

<p>When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Romeo’s man Balthasar, in riding boots.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>News from Verona!–How now, Balthasar?</p>

<p>Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?</p>

<p>How doth my lady? Is my father well?</p>

<p>How doth my Juliet? That I ask again,</p>

<p>For nothing can be ill if she be well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Balthasar</sc></p>

<p>Then she is well and nothing can be ill.</p>

<p>Her body sleeps in Capels’ monument,</p>

<p>And her immortal part with angels lives.</p>

<p>I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault</p>

<p>And presently took post to tell it you.</p>

<p>O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,</p>

<p>Since you did leave it for my office, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Is it e’en so?–Then I deny you, stars!–</p>

<p>Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper,</p>

<p>And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Balthasar</sc></p>

<p>I do beseech you, sir, have patience.</p>

<p>Your looks are pale and wild and do import</p>

<p>Some misadventure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc>  Tush, thou art deceived.</p>

<p>Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.</p>

<p>Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Balthasar</sc></p>

<p>No, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc>  No matter. Get thee gone,</p>

<p>And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.</p>

<p><center><i>[Balthasar exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.</p>

<p>Let’s see for means. O mischief, thou art swift</p>

<p>To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.</p>

<p>I do remember an apothecary</p>

<p>(And hereabouts he dwells) which late I noted</p>

<p>In tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows,</p>

<p>Culling of simples. Meager were his looks.</p>

<p>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones.</p>

<p>And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,</p>

<p>An alligator stuffed, and other skins</p>

<p>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves,</p>

<p>A beggarly account of empty boxes,</p>

<p>Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,</p>

<p>Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses</p>

<p>Were thinly scattered to make up a show.</p>

<p>Noting this penury, to myself I said</p>

<p>“An if a man did need a poison now,</p>

<p>Whose sale is present death in Mantua,</p>

<p>Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.”</p>

<p>O, this same thought did but forerun my need,</p>

<p>And this same needy man must sell it me.</p>

<p>As I remember, this should be the house.</p>

<p>Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.–</p>

<p>What ho, Apothecary!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Apothecary.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apothecary</sc>  Who calls so loud?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.</p>

<p><center><i>[He offers money.]</i></center></p>

<p>Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have</p>

<p>A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear</p>

<p>As will disperse itself through all the veins,</p>

<p>That the life-weary taker may fall dead,</p>

<p>And that the trunk may be discharged of breath</p>

<p>As violently as hasty powder fired</p>

<p>Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apothecary</sc></p>

<p>Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law</p>

<p>Is death to any he that utters them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,</p>

<p>And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,</p>

<p>Need and oppression starveth in thy eyes,</p>

<p>Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.</p>

<p>The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law.</p>

<p>The world affords no law to make thee rich.</p>

<p>Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apothecary</sc></p>

<p>My poverty, but not my will, consents.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>I pay thy poverty and not thy will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apothecary</sc> <i>[giving him the poison]</i></p>

<p>Put this in any liquid thing you will</p>

<p>And drink it off, and if you had the strength</p>

<p>Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc> <i>[handing him the money]</i></p>

<p>There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,</p>

<p>Doing more murder in this loathsome world</p>

<p>Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not</p>

<p>sell.</p>

<p>I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.</p>

<p>Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.</p>

<p><center><i>[Apothecary exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Come, cordial and not poison, go with me</p>

<p>To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
