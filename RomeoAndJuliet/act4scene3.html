<p><center><i>[Enter Juliet and Nurse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle nurse,</p>

<p>I pray thee leave me to myself tonight,</p>

<p>For I have need of many orisons</p>

<p>To move the heavens to smile upon my state,</p>

<p>Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lady Capulet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>No, madam, we have culled such necessaries</p>

<p>As are behooveful for our state tomorrow.</p>

<p>So please you, let me now be left alone,</p>

<p>And let the Nurse this night sit up with you,</p>

<p>For I am sure you have your hands full all</p>

<p>In this so sudden business.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span>  Good night.</p>

<p>Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lady Capulet and the Nurse exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Farewell.–God knows when we shall meet again.</p>

<p>I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins</p>

<p>That almost freezes up the heat of life.</p>

<p>I’ll call them back again to comfort me.–</p>

<p>Nurse!–What should she do here?</p>

<p>My dismal scene I needs must act alone.</p>

<p>Come, vial.     <i><i>[She takes out the vial.]</i></i></p>

<p>What if this mixture do not work at all?</p>

<p>Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?</p>

<p><center><i>[She takes out her knife</p>

<p>and puts it down beside her.]</i></center></p>

<p>No, no, this shall forbid it. Lie thou there.</p>

<p>What if it be a poison which the Friar</p>

<p>Subtly hath ministered to have me dead,</p>

<p>Lest in this marriage he should be dishonored</p>

<p>Because he married me before to Romeo?</p>

<p>I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,</p>

<p>For he hath still been tried a holy man.</p>

<p>How if, when I am laid into the tomb,</p>

<p>I wake before the time that Romeo</p>

<p>Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point.</p>

<p>Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,</p>

<p>To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,</p>

<p>And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?</p>

<p>Or, if I live, is it not very like</p>

<p>The horrible conceit of death and night,</p>

<p>Together with the terror of the place–</p>

<p>As in a vault, an ancient receptacle</p>

<p>Where for this many hundred years the bones</p>

<p>Of all my buried ancestors are packed;</p>

<p>Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,</p>

<p>Lies fest’ring in his shroud; where, as they say,</p>

<p>At some hours in the night spirits resort–</p>

<p>Alack, alack, is it not like that I,</p>

<p>So early waking, what with loathsome smells,</p>

<p>And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,</p>

<p>That living mortals, hearing them, run mad–</p>

<p>O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,</p>

<p>Environed with all these hideous fears,</p>

<p>And madly play with my forefathers’ joints,</p>

<p>And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,</p>

<p>And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,</p>

<p>As with a club, dash out my desp’rate brains?</p>

<p>O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost</p>

<p>Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body</p>

<p>Upon a rapier’s point! Stay, Tybalt, stay!</p>

<p>Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here’s drink. I drink to</p>

<p>thee.     <i><i>[She drinks and falls upon her bed</i></p>

<p>within the curtains.]</i></p>
