<p><center><i>[Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.</p>

<p>It was the nightingale, and not the lark,</p>

<p>That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.</p>

<p>Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.</p>

<p>Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>It was the lark, the herald of the morn,</p>

<p>No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks</p>

<p>Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.</p>

<p>Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day</p>

<p>Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops.</p>

<p>I must be gone and live, or stay and die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.</p>

<p>It is some meteor that the sun exhaled</p>

<p>To be to thee this night a torchbearer</p>

<p>And light thee on thy way to Mantua.</p>

<p>Therefore stay yet. Thou need’st not to be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Let me be ta’en; let me be put to death.</p>

<p>I am content, so thou wilt have it so.</p>

<p>I’ll say yon gray is not the morning’s eye;</p>

<p>’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.</p>

<p>Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat</p>

<p>The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.</p>

<p>I have more care to stay than will to go.</p>

<p>Come death and welcome. Juliet wills it so.</p>

<p>How is ’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>It is, it is. Hie hence, begone, away!</p>

<p>It is the lark that sings so out of tune,</p>

<p>Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.</p>

<p>Some say the lark makes sweet division.</p>

<p>This doth not so, for she divideth us.</p>

<p>Some say the lark and loathed toad changed eyes.</p>

<p>O, now I would they had changed voices too,</p>

<p>Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,</p>

<p>Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.</p>

<p>O, now begone. More light and light it grows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>More light and light, more dark and dark our woes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Nurse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span>  Nurse?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.</p>

<p>The day is broke; be wary; look about.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Then, window, let day in, and let life out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>Farewell, farewell. One kiss and I’ll descend.</p>

<p><center><i>[They kiss, and Romeo descends.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend!</p>

<p>I must hear from thee every day in the hour,</p>

<p>For in a minute there are many days.</p>

<p>O, by this count I shall be much in years</p>

<p>Ere I again behold my Romeo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span>  Farewell.</p>

<p>I will omit no opportunity</p>

<p>That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>O, think’st thou we shall ever meet again?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve</p>

<p>For sweet discourses in our times to come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>O God, I have an ill-divining soul!</p>

<p>Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,</p>

<p>As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.</p>

<p>Either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Romeo</span></p>

<p>And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.</p>

<p>Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>O Fortune, Fortune, all men call thee fickle.</p>

<p>If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him</p>

<p>That is renowned for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,</p>

<p>For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long,</p>

<p>But send him back.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lady Capulet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span>  Ho, daughter, are you up?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Who is ’t that calls? It is my lady mother.</p>

<p>Is she not down so late or up so early?</p>

<p>What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?</p>

<p><center><i>[Juliet descends.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Why, how now, Juliet?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span>  Madam, I am not well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?</p>

<p>What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?</p>

<p>An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.</p>

<p>Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of</p>

<p>love,</p>

<p>But much of grief shows still some want of wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend</p>

<p>Which you weep for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span>  Feeling so the loss,</p>

<p>I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death</p>

<p>As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>What villain, madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span>  That same villain, Romeo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Villain and he be many miles asunder.–</p>

<p>God pardon him. I do with all my heart,</p>

<p>And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>That is because the traitor murderer lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.</p>

<p>Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.</p>

<p>Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,</p>

<p>Where that same banished runagate doth live,</p>

<p>Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram</p>

<p>That he shall soon keep Tybalt company.</p>

<p>And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Indeed, I never shall be satisfied</p>

<p>With Romeo till I behold him–dead–</p>

<p>Is my poor heart, so for a kinsman vexed.</p>

<p>Madam, if you could find out but a man</p>

<p>To bear a poison, I would temper it,</p>

<p>That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,</p>

<p>Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors</p>

<p>To hear him named and cannot come to him</p>

<p>To wreak the love I bore my cousin</p>

<p>Upon his body that hath slaughtered him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.</p>

<p>But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>And joy comes well in such a needy time.</p>

<p>What are they, beseech your Ladyship?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child,</p>

<p>One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,</p>

<p>Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy</p>

<p>That thou expects not, nor I looked not for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Madam, in happy time! What day is that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn</p>

<p>The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,</p>

<p>The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church</p>

<p>Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Now, by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,</p>

<p>He shall not make me there a joyful bride!</p>

<p>I wonder at this haste, that I must wed</p>

<p>Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.</p>

<p>I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,</p>

<p>I will not marry yet, and when I do I swear</p>

<p>It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,</p>

<p>Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,</p>

<p>And see how he will take it at your hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Capulet and Nurse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>When the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew,</p>

<p>But for the sunset of my brother’s son</p>

<p>It rains downright.</p>

<p>How now, a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?</p>

<p>Evermore show’ring? In one little body</p>

<p>Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.</p>

<p>For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,</p>

<p>Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,</p>

<p>Sailing in this salt flood; the winds thy sighs,</p>

<p>Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,</p>

<p>Without a sudden calm, will overset</p>

<p>Thy tempest-tossed body.–How now, wife?</p>

<p>Have you delivered to her our decree?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Ay, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks.</p>

<p>I would the fool were married to her grave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Soft, take me with you, take me with you, wife.</p>

<p>How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?</p>

<p>Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blessed,</p>

<p>Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought</p>

<p>So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.</p>

<p>Proud can I never be of what I hate,</p>

<p>But thankful even for hate that is meant love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>How, how, how, how? Chopped logic? What is this?</p>

<p>“Proud,” and “I thank you,” and “I thank you not,”</p>

<p>And yet “not proud”? Mistress minion you,</p>

<p>Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,</p>

<p>But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next</p>

<p>To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,</p>

<p>Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.</p>

<p>Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!</p>

<p>You tallow face!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span>  Fie, fie, what, are you mad?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Good father, I beseech you on my knees,</p>

<p>Hear me with patience but to speak a word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch!</p>

<p>I tell thee what: get thee to church o’ Thursday,</p>

<p>Or never after look me in the face.</p>

<p>Speak not; reply not; do not answer me.</p>

<p>My fingers itch.–Wife, we scarce thought us</p>

<p>blessed</p>

<p>That God had lent us but this only child,</p>

<p>But now I see this one is one too much,</p>

<p>And that we have a curse in having her.</p>

<p>Out on her, hilding.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  God in heaven bless her!</p>

<p>You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue.</p>

<p>Good Prudence, smatter with your gossips, go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>I speak no treason.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span>  O, God ’i’ g’ eden!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>May not one speak?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span>  Peace, you mumbling fool!</p>

<p>Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,</p>

<p>For here we need it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span>  You are too hot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Capulet</span>  God’s bread, it makes me mad.</p>

<p>Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,</p>

<p>Alone, in company, still my care hath been</p>

<p>To have her matched. And having now provided</p>

<p>A gentleman of noble parentage,</p>

<p>Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly ligned,</p>

<p>Stuffed, as they say, with honorable parts,</p>

<p>Proportioned as one’s thought would wish a man–</p>

<p>And then to have a wretched puling fool,</p>

<p>A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,</p>

<p>To answer “I’ll not wed. I cannot love.</p>

<p>I am too young. I pray you, pardon me.”</p>

<p>But, an you will not wed, I’ll pardon you!</p>

<p>Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.</p>

<p>Look to ’t; think on ’t. I do not use to jest.</p>

<p>Thursday is near. Lay hand on heart; advise.</p>

<p>An you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend.</p>

<p>An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,</p>

<p>For, by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,</p>

<p>Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.</p>

<p>Trust to ’t; bethink you. I’ll not be forsworn.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Is there no pity sitting in the clouds</p>

<p>That sees into the bottom of my grief?–</p>

<p>O sweet my mother, cast me not away.</p>

<p>Delay this marriage for a month, a week,</p>

<p>Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed</p>

<p>In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady</span> <span class='sc'>Capulet</span></p>

<p>Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.</p>

<p>Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span> <i>[rising]</i></p>

<p>O God! O nurse, how shall this be prevented?</p>

<p>My husband is on Earth, my faith in heaven.</p>

<p>How shall that faith return again to Earth</p>

<p>Unless that husband send it me from heaven</p>

<p>By leaving Earth? Comfort me; counsel me.–</p>

<p>Alack, alack, that heaven should practice stratagems</p>

<p>Upon so soft a subject as myself.–</p>

<p>What sayst thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?</p>

<p>Some comfort, nurse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  Faith, here it is.</p>

<p>Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing</p>

<p>That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you,</p>

<p>Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.</p>

<p>Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,</p>

<p>I think it best you married with the County.</p>

<p>O, he’s a lovely gentleman!</p>

<p>Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,</p>

<p>Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye</p>

<p>As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,</p>

<p>I think you are happy in this second match,</p>

<p>For it excels your first, or, if it did not,</p>

<p>Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were</p>

<p>As living here and you no use of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Speak’st thou from thy heart?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>And from my soul too, else beshrew them both.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span>  What?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.</p>

<p>Go in and tell my lady I am gone,</p>

<p>Having displeased my father, to Lawrence’ cell</p>

<p>To make confession and to be absolved.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nurse</span></p>

<p>Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Juliet</span></p>

<p>Ancient damnation, O most wicked fiend!</p>

<p>Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn</p>

<p>Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue</p>

<p>Which she hath praised him with above compare</p>

<p>So many thousand times? Go, counselor.</p>

<p>Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.</p>

<p>I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.</p>

<p>If all else fail, myself have power to die.</p>
