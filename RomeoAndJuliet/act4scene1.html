<p><center><i>[Enter Friar Lawrence and County Paris.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paris</sc></p>

<p>My father Capulet will have it so,</p>

<p>And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>You say you do not know the lady’s mind?</p>

<p>Uneven is the course. I like it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paris</sc></p>

<p>Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,</p>

<p>And therefore have I little talk of love,</p>

<p>For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.</p>

<p>Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous</p>

<p>That she do give her sorrow so much sway,</p>

<p>And in his wisdom hastes our marriage</p>

<p>To stop the inundation of her tears,</p>

<p>Which, too much minded by herself alone,</p>

<p>May be put from her by society.</p>

<p>Now do you know the reason of this haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I would I knew not why it should be slowed.–</p>

<p>Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Juliet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paris</sc></p>

<p>Happily met, my lady and my wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paris</sc></p>

<p>That “may be” must be, love, on Thursday next.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>What must be shall be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc>  That’s a certain text.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paris</sc></p>

<p>Come you to make confession to this father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>To answer that, I should confess to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paris</sc></p>

<p>Do not deny to him that you love me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>I will confess to you that I love him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paris</sc></p>

<p>So will you, I am sure, that you love me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>If I do so, it will be of more price</p>

<p>Being spoke behind your back than to your face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paris</sc></p>

<p>Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>The tears have got small victory by that,</p>

<p>For it was bad enough before their spite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paris</sc></p>

<p>Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,</p>

<p>And what I spake, I spake it to my face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paris</sc></p>

<p>Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>It may be so, for it is not mine own.–</p>

<p>Are you at leisure, holy father, now,</p>

<p>Or shall I come to you at evening Mass?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.–</p>

<p>My lord, we must entreat the time alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paris</sc></p>

<p>God shield I should disturb devotion!–</p>

<p>Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you.</p>

<p>Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>O, shut the door, and when thou hast done so,</p>

<p>Come weep with me, past hope, past care, past help.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>O Juliet, I already know thy grief.</p>

<p>It strains me past the compass of my wits.</p>

<p>I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,</p>

<p>On Thursday next be married to this County.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Tell me not, friar, that thou hearest of this,</p>

<p>Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.</p>

<p>If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,</p>

<p>Do thou but call my resolution wise,</p>

<p>And with this knife I’ll help it presently.</p>

<p><center><i>[She shows him her knife.]</i></center></p>

<p>God joined my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;</p>

<p>And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s sealed,</p>

<p>Shall be the label to another deed,</p>

<p>Or my true heart with treacherous revolt</p>

<p>Turn to another, this shall slay them both.</p>

<p>Therefore out of thy long-experienced time</p>

<p>Give me some present counsel, or, behold,</p>

<p>’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife</p>

<p>Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that</p>

<p>Which the commission of thy years and art</p>

<p>Could to no issue of true honor bring.</p>

<p>Be not so long to speak. I long to die</p>

<p>If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>Hold, daughter, I do spy a kind of hope,</p>

<p>Which craves as desperate an execution</p>

<p>As that is desperate which we would prevent.</p>

<p>If, rather than to marry County Paris,</p>

<p>Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,</p>

<p>Then is it likely thou wilt undertake</p>

<p>A thing like death to chide away this shame,</p>

<p>That cop’st with death himself to ’scape from it;</p>

<p>And if thou darest, I’ll give thee remedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,</p>

<p>From off the battlements of any tower,</p>

<p>Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk</p>

<p>Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears,</p>

<p>Or hide me nightly in a charnel house,</p>

<p>O’ercovered quite with dead men’s rattling bones,</p>

<p>With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.</p>

<p>Or bid me go into a new-made grave</p>

<p>And hide me with a dead man in his shroud</p>

<p>(Things that to hear them told have made me</p>

<p>tremble),</p>

<p>And I will do it without fear or doubt,</p>

<p>To live an unstained wife to my sweet love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>Hold, then. Go home; be merry; give consent</p>

<p>To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone;</p>

<p>Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.</p>

<p><center><i>[Holding out a vial.]</i></center></p>

<p>Take thou this vial, being then in bed,</p>

<p>And this distilling liquor drink thou off;</p>

<p>When presently through all thy veins shall run</p>

<p>A cold and drowsy humor; for no pulse</p>

<p>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.</p>

<p>No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.</p>

<p>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade</p>

<p>To paly ashes, thy eyes’ windows fall</p>

<p>Like death when he shuts up the day of life.</p>

<p>Each part, deprived of supple government,</p>

<p>Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death,</p>

<p>And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death</p>

<p>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours</p>

<p>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.</p>

<p>Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes</p>

<p>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.</p>

<p>Then, as the manner of our country is,</p>

<p>In thy best robes uncovered on the bier</p>

<p>Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault</p>

<p>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</p>

<p>In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,</p>

<p>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,</p>

<p>And hither shall he come, and he and I</p>

<p>Will watch thy waking, and that very night</p>

<p>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.</p>

<p>And this shall free thee from this present shame,</p>

<p>If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear</p>

<p>Abate thy valor in the acting it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc> <i>[giving Juliet the vial]</i></p>

<p>Hold, get you gone. Be strong and prosperous</p>

<p>In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed</p>

<p>To Mantua with my letters to thy lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Juliet</sc></p>

<p>Love give me strength, and strength shall help</p>

<p>afford.</p>

<p>Farewell, dear father.</p>
