<p><center><i>[Enter Sampson and Gregory, with swords and bucklers,</p>

<p>of the house of Capulet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  Gregory, on my word we’ll not carry coals.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  No, for then we should be colliers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of</p>

<p>collar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  I strike quickly, being moved.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to</p>

<p>stand. Therefore if thou art moved thou runn’st</p>

<p>away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I</p>

<p>will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest</p>

<p>goes to the wall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  ’Tis true, and therefore women, being the</p>

<p>weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore</p>

<p>I will push Montague’s men from the wall and</p>

<p>thrust his maids to the wall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  The quarrel is between our masters and us</p>

<p>their men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  ’Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant.</p>

<p>When I have fought with the men, I will be civil</p>

<p>with the maids; I will cut off their heads.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  The heads of the maids?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.</p>

<p>Take it in what sense thou wilt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  They must take it in sense that feel it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  Me they shall feel while I am able to stand,</p>

<p>and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  ’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou</p>

<p>hadst been poor-john. Draw thy tool. Here comes</p>

<p>of the house of Montagues.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Abram with another Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  My naked weapon is out. Quarrel, I will back</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  How? Turn thy back and run?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  Fear me not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  No, marry. I fear thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  Let us take the law of our sides; let them</p>

<p>begin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it</p>

<p>as they list.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at</p>

<p>them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.</p>

<p><center><i>[He bites his thumb.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abram</sc>  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  I do bite my thumb, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abram</sc>  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc> <i>[aside to Gregory]</i>  Is the law of our side if I</p>

<p>say “Ay”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc> <i>[aside to Sampson]</i>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,</p>

<p>but I bite my thumb, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc>  Do you quarrel, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abram</sc>  Quarrel, sir? No, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as</p>

<p>good a man as you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abram</sc>  No better.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  Well, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Benvolio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gregory</sc> <i>[aside to Sampson]</i>  Say “better”; here comes</p>

<p>one of my master’s kinsmen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  Yes, better, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abram</sc>  You lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sampson</sc>  Draw if you be men.–Gregory, remember</p>

<p>thy washing blow.     <i><i>[They fight.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc>  Part, fools!     <i><i>[Drawing his sword.]</i></i></p>

<p>Put up your swords. You know not what you do.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Tybalt, drawing his sword.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc></p>

<p>What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?</p>

<p>Turn thee, Benvolio; look upon thy death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,</p>

<p>Or manage it to part these men with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tybalt</sc></p>

<p>What, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word</p>

<p>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.</p>

<p>Have at thee, coward!     <i><i>[They fight.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter three or four Citizens with clubs or partisans.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Citizens</sc></p>

<p>Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!</p>

<p>Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a</p>

<p>sword?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter old Montague and his Wife.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Capulet</sc></p>

<p>My sword, I say. Old Montague is come</p>

<p>And flourishes his blade in spite of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montague</sc></p>

<p>Thou villain Capulet!–Hold me not; let me go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Montague</sc></p>

<p>Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Prince Escalus with his train.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</p>

<p>Profaners of this neighbor-stained steel–</p>

<p>Will they not hear?–What ho! You men, you beasts,</p>

<p>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</p>

<p>With purple fountains issuing from your veins:</p>

<p>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</p>

<p>Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,</p>

<p>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</p>

<p>Three civil brawls bred of an airy word</p>

<p>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</p>

<p>Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets</p>

<p>And made Verona’s ancient citizens</p>

<p>Cast by their grave-beseeming ornaments</p>

<p>To wield old partisans in hands as old,</p>

<p>Cankered with peace, to part your cankered hate.</p>

<p>If ever you disturb our streets again,</p>

<p>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</p>

<p>For this time all the rest depart away.</p>

<p>You, Capulet, shall go along with me,</p>

<p>And, Montague, come you this afternoon</p>

<p>To know our farther pleasure in this case,</p>

<p>To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.</p>

<p>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Montague, Lady Montague,</p>

<p>and Benvolio exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montague</sc> <i>[to Benvolio]</i></p>

<p>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?</p>

<p>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Here were the servants of your adversary,</p>

<p>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.</p>

<p>I drew to part them. In the instant came</p>

<p>The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared,</p>

<p>Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,</p>

<p>He swung about his head and cut the winds,</p>

<p>Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.</p>

<p>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows</p>

<p>Came more and more and fought on part and part,</p>

<p>Till the Prince came, who parted either part.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lady</sc> <sc>Montague</sc></p>

<p>O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?</p>

<p>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Madam, an hour before the worshiped sun</p>

<p>Peered forth the golden window of the east,</p>

<p>A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad,</p>

<p>Where underneath the grove of sycamore</p>

<p>That westward rooteth from this city side,</p>

<p>So early walking did I see your son.</p>

<p>Towards him I made, but he was ’ware of me</p>

<p>And stole into the covert of the wood.</p>

<p>I, measuring his affections by my own</p>

<p>(Which then most sought where most might not be</p>

<p>found,</p>

<p>Being one too many by my weary self),</p>

<p>Pursued my humor, not pursuing his,</p>

<p>And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montague</sc></p>

<p>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</p>

<p>With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,</p>

<p>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.</p>

<p>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</p>

<p>Should in the farthest east begin to draw</p>

<p>The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,</p>

<p>Away from light steals home my heavy son</p>

<p>And private in his chamber pens himself,</p>

<p>Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,</p>

<p>And makes himself an artificial night.</p>

<p>Black and portentous must this humor prove,</p>

<p>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montague</sc></p>

<p>I neither know it nor can learn of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Have you importuned him by any means?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montague</sc></p>

<p>Both by myself and many other friends.</p>

<p>But he, his own affections’ counselor,</p>

<p>Is to himself–I will not say how true,</p>

<p>But to himself so secret and so close,</p>

<p>So far from sounding and discovery,</p>

<p>As is the bud bit with an envious worm</p>

<p>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air</p>

<p>Or dedicate his beauty to the same.</p>

<p>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,</p>

<p>We would as willingly give cure as know.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Romeo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>See where he comes. So please you, step aside.</p>

<p>I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montague</sc></p>

<p>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay</p>

<p>To hear true shrift.–Come, madam, let’s away.</p>

<p><center><i>[Montague and Lady Montague exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Good morrow, cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc>  Is the day so young?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>But new struck nine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc>  Ay me, sad hours seem long.</p>

<p>Was that my father that went hence so fast?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Not having that which, having, makes them short.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc>  In love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc>  Out–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc>  Of love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Out of her favor where I am in love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Alas that love, so gentle in his view,</p>

<p>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,</p>

<p>Should without eyes see pathways to his will!</p>

<p>Where shall we dine?–O me! What fray was here?</p>

<p>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.</p>

<p>Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love.</p>

<p>Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,</p>

<p>O anything of nothing first create!</p>

<p>O heavy lightness, serious vanity,</p>

<p>Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,</p>

<p>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,</p>

<p>Still-waking sleep that is not what it is!</p>

<p>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</p>

<p>Dost thou not laugh?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc>  No, coz, I rather weep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Good heart, at what?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc>  At thy good heart’s oppression.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc>  Why, such is love’s transgression.</p>

<p>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</p>

<p>Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed</p>

<p>With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown</p>

<p>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</p>

<p>Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;</p>

<p>Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;</p>

<p>Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.</p>

<p>What is it else? A madness most discreet,</p>

<p>A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.</p>

<p>Farewell, my coz.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc>  Soft, I will go along.</p>

<p>An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.</p>

<p>This is not Romeo. He’s some other where.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc>  What, shall I groan and tell thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Groan? Why, no. But sadly tell me who.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>A sick man in sadness makes his will–</p>

<p>A word ill urged to one that is so ill.</p>

<p>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>A right good markman! And she’s fair I love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Well in that hit you miss. She’ll not be hit</p>

<p>With Cupid’s arrow. She hath Dian’s wit,</p>

<p>And, in strong proof of chastity well armed,</p>

<p>From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.</p>

<p>She will not stay the siege of loving terms,</p>

<p>Nor bide th’ encounter of assailing eyes,</p>

<p>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.</p>

<p>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor</p>

<p>That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;</p>

<p>For beauty, starved with her severity,</p>

<p>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</p>

<p>She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,</p>

<p>To merit bliss by making me despair.</p>

<p>She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow</p>

<p>Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>O, teach me how I should forget to think!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>By giving liberty unto thine eyes.</p>

<p>Examine other beauties.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc>  ’Tis the way</p>

<p>To call hers, exquisite, in question more.</p>

<p>These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,</p>

<p>Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.</p>

<p>He that is strucken blind cannot forget</p>

<p>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.</p>

<p>Show me a mistress that is passing fair;</p>

<p>What doth her beauty serve but as a note</p>

<p>Where I may read who passed that passing fair?</p>

<p>Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benvolio</sc></p>

<p>I’ll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.</p>
