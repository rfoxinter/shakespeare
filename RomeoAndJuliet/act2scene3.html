<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,</p>

<p>Check’ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light,</p>

<p>And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels</p>

<p>From forth day’s path and Titan’s fiery wheels.</p>

<p>Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,</p>

<p>The day to cheer and night’s dank dew to dry,</p>

<p>I must upfill this osier cage of ours</p>

<p>With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.</p>

<p>The Earth that’s nature’s mother is her tomb;</p>

<p>What is her burying grave, that is her womb;</p>

<p>And from her womb children of divers kind</p>

<p>We sucking on her natural bosom find,</p>

<p>Many for many virtues excellent,</p>

<p>None but for some, and yet all different.</p>

<p>O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</p>

<p>In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.</p>

<p>For naught so vile that on the Earth doth live</p>

<p>But to the Earth some special good doth give;</p>

<p>Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use,</p>

<p>Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.</p>

<p>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,</p>

<p>And vice sometime by action dignified.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Romeo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Within the infant rind of this weak flower</p>

<p>Poison hath residence and medicine power:</p>

<p>For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each</p>

<p>part;</p>

<p>Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart.</p>

<p>Two such opposed kings encamp them still</p>

<p>In man as well as herbs–grace and rude will;</p>

<p>And where the worser is predominant,</p>

<p>Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Good morrow, father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc>  Benedicite.</p>

<p>What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?</p>

<p>Young son, it argues a distempered head</p>

<p>So soon to bid “Good morrow” to thy bed.</p>

<p>Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,</p>

<p>And, where care lodges, sleep will never lie;</p>

<p>But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain</p>

<p>Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth</p>

<p>reign.</p>

<p>Therefore thy earliness doth me assure</p>

<p>Thou art uproused with some distemp’rature,</p>

<p>Or, if not so, then here I hit it right:</p>

<p>Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>That last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.</p>

<p>I have forgot that name and that name’s woe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>That’s my good son. But where hast thou been</p>

<p>then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.</p>

<p>I have been feasting with mine enemy,</p>

<p>Where on a sudden one hath wounded me</p>

<p>That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies</p>

<p>Within thy help and holy physic lies.</p>

<p>I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,</p>

<p>My intercession likewise steads my foe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.</p>

<p>Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set</p>

<p>On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.</p>

<p>As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,</p>

<p>And all combined, save what thou must combine</p>

<p>By holy marriage. When and where and how</p>

<p>We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow</p>

<p>I’ll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,</p>

<p>That thou consent to marry us today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!</p>

<p>Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,</p>

<p>So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies</p>

<p>Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.</p>

<p>Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine</p>

<p>Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!</p>

<p>How much salt water thrown away in waste</p>

<p>To season love, that of it doth not taste!</p>

<p>The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,</p>

<p>Thy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears.</p>

<p>Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit</p>

<p>Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.</p>

<p>If e’er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,</p>

<p>Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.</p>

<p>And art thou changed? Pronounce this sentence</p>

<p>then:</p>

<p>Women may fall when there’s no strength in men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>And bad’st me bury love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc>  Not in a grave</p>

<p>To lay one in, another out to have.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>I pray thee, chide me not. Her I love now</p>

<p>Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.</p>

<p>The other did not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc>  O, she knew well</p>

<p>Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.</p>

<p>But come, young waverer, come, go with me.</p>

<p>In one respect I’ll thy assistant be,</p>

<p>For this alliance may so happy prove</p>

<p>To turn your households’ rancor to pure love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Romeo</sc></p>

<p>O, let us hence. I stand on sudden haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Lawrence</sc></p>

<p>Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.</p>
