<p><center><i>[Enter Grumio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters,</p>

<p>and all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was</p>

<p>ever man so ’rayed? Was ever man so weary? I am</p>

<p>sent before to make a fire, and they are coming</p>

<p>after to warm them. Now were not I a little pot and</p>

<p>soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my</p>

<p>tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my</p>

<p>belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me. But I</p>

<p>with blowing the fire shall warm myself. For, considering</p>

<p>the weather, a taller man than I will take</p>

<p>cold.–Holla, ho, Curtis!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Curtis.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  Who is that calls so coldly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst</p>

<p>slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater</p>

<p>a run but my head and my neck. A fire, good Curtis!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Oh, ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire! Cast</p>

<p>on no water.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  Is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  She was, good Curtis, before this frost. But</p>

<p>thou know’st winter tames man, woman, and</p>

<p>beast, for it hath tamed my old master and my new</p>

<p>mistress and myself, fellow Curtis.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  Away, you three-inch fool, I am no beast!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a</p>

<p>foot, and so long am I, at the least. But wilt thou</p>

<p>make a fire? Or shall I complain on thee to our</p>

<p>mistress, whose hand (she being now at hand) thou</p>

<p>shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in</p>

<p>thy hot office?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the</p>

<p>world?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine,</p>

<p>and therefore fire! Do thy duty, and have thy duty,</p>

<p>for my master and mistress are almost frozen to</p>

<p>death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  There’s fire ready. And therefore, good Grumio,</p>

<p>the news!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Why, “Jack boy, ho boy!” and as much news</p>

<p>as wilt thou.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  Come, you are so full of cony-catching.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Why, therefore fire, for I have caught extreme</p>

<p>cold. Where’s the cook? Is supper ready, the house</p>

<p>trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the servingmen</p>

<p>in their new fustian, their white stockings,</p>

<p>and every officer his wedding garment on? Be</p>

<p>the Jacks fair within, the Jills fair without, the</p>

<p>carpets laid, and everything in order?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  All ready. And therefore, I pray thee, news.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  First, know my horse is tired, my master and</p>

<p>mistress fallen out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  How?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Out of their saddles into the dirt, and thereby</p>

<p>hangs a tale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  Let’s ha’ t, good Grumio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Lend thine ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  Here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  There!     <i><i>[He slaps Curtis on the ear.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  This ’tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  And therefore ’tis called a sensible tale. And</p>

<p>this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech</p>

<p>list’ning. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a</p>

<p>foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  Both of one horse?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  What’s that to thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  Why, a horse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Tell thou the tale! But hadst thou not crossed</p>

<p>me, thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell,</p>

<p>and she under her horse; thou shouldst have heard</p>

<p>in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he</p>

<p>left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me</p>

<p>because her horse stumbled, how she waded</p>

<p>through the dirt to pluck him off me, how he swore,</p>

<p>how she prayed that never prayed before, how I</p>

<p>cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was</p>

<p>burst, how I lost my crupper, with many things of</p>

<p>worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion,</p>

<p>and thou return unexperienced to thy grave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  By this reck’ning, he is more shrew than she.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all</p>

<p>shall find when he comes home. But what talk I of</p>

<p>this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Phillip,</p>

<p>Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest. Let their heads</p>

<p>be slickly combed, their blue coats brushed, and</p>

<p>their garters of an indifferent knit. Let them curtsy</p>

<p>with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair</p>

<p>of my master’s horse-tail till they kiss their hands.</p>

<p>Are they all ready?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  They are.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Call them forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc> <i>[calling out]</i>  Do you hear, ho? You must meet</p>

<p>my master to countenance my mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Why, she hath a face of her own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  Who knows not that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Thou, it seems, that calls for company to</p>

<p>countenance her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  I call them forth to credit her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter four or five Servingmen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  Welcome home, Grumio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Phillip</sc>  How now, Grumio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Joseph</sc>  What, Grumio!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nicholas</sc>  Fellow Grumio!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  How now, old lad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Welcome, you!–How now, you?–What,</p>

<p>you!–Fellow, you!–And thus much for greeting.</p>

<p>Now, my spruce companions, is all ready and all</p>

<p>things neat?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  All things is ready. How near is our</p>

<p>master?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  E’en at hand, alighted by this. And therefore</p>

<p>be not–Cock’s passion, silence! I hear my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Petruchio and Katherine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Where be these knaves? What, no man at door</p>

<p>To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse?</p>

<p>Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Phillip?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc> <sc>The</sc> <sc>Servants</sc>  Here! Here, sir, here, sir!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>“Here, sir! Here, sir! Here, sir! Here, sir!”</p>

<p>You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms.</p>

<p>What? No attendance? No regard? No duty?</p>

<p>Where is the foolish knave I sent before?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc></p>

<p>Here, sir, as foolish as I was before.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>You peasant swain, you whoreson malt-horse</p>

<p>drudge!</p>

<p>Did I not bid thee meet me in the park</p>

<p>And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc></p>

<p>Nathaniel’s coat, sir, was not fully made,</p>

<p>And Gabriel’s pumps were all unpinked i’ th’ heel.</p>

<p>There was no link to color Peter’s hat,</p>

<p>And Walter’s dagger was not come from sheathing.</p>

<p>There were none fine but Adam, Rafe, and Gregory.</p>

<p>The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly.</p>

<p>Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in!</p>

<p><center><i>[The Servants exit.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>Where is the life that late I led?</i></p>

<p>     <i>Where are those–</i></p>

<p>Sit down, Kate, and welcome.</p>

<p><center><i>[They sit at a table.]</i></center></p>

<p>Soud, soud, soud, soud!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servants with supper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Why, when, I say?–Nay, good sweet Kate, be</p>

<p>merry.–</p>

<p>Off with my boots, you rogues, you villains! When?</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>It was the friar of orders gray,</i></p>

<p>     <i>As he forth walked on his way–</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Servant begins to remove Petruchio’s boots.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Out, you rogue! You pluck my foot awry.</p>

<p>Take that!     <i><i>[He hits the Servant.]</i></i></p>

<p>And mend the plucking of the other.–</p>

<p>Be merry, Kate.–Some water here! What ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter one with water.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Where’s my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence</p>

<p>And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither.</p>

<p><center><i>[A Servant exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted</p>

<p>with.–</p>

<p>Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?–</p>

<p>Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.–</p>

<p>You whoreson villain, will you let it fall?</p>

<p><center><i>[He hits the Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Patience, I pray you, ’twas a fault unwilling.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>A whoreson beetle-headed flap-eared knave!–</p>

<p>Come, Kate, sit down. I know you have a stomach.</p>

<p>Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?–</p>

<p>What’s this? Mutton?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servant</sc>  Ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc>  Who brought it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Peter</sc>  I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc>  ’Tis burnt, and so is all the meat.</p>

<p>What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?</p>

<p>How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser</p>

<p>And serve it thus to me that love it not?</p>

<p>There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all!</p>

<p><center><i>[He throws the food and dishes at them.]</i></center></p>

<p>You heedless joltheads and unmannered slaves!</p>

<p>What, do you grumble? I’ll be with you straight.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Servants exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet.</p>

<p>The meat was well, if you were so contented.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>I tell thee, Kate, ’twas burnt and dried away,</p>

<p>And I expressly am forbid to touch it,</p>

<p>For it engenders choler, planteth anger,</p>

<p>And better ’twere that both of us did fast</p>

<p>(Since of ourselves, ourselves are choleric)</p>

<p>Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.</p>

<p>Be patient. Tomorrow ’t shall be mended,</p>

<p>And for this night we’ll fast for company.</p>

<p>Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servants severally.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  Peter, didst ever see the like?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Peter</sc>  He kills her in her own humor.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Curtis.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Where is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curtis</sc>  In her chamber,</p>

<p>Making a sermon of continency to her,</p>

<p>And rails and swears and rates, that she (poor soul)</p>

<p>Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,</p>

<p>And sits as one new-risen from a dream.</p>

<p>Away, away, for he is coming hither!</p>

<p><center><i>[The Servants exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Petruchio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Thus have I politicly begun my reign,</p>

<p>And ’tis my hope to end successfully.</p>

<p>My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,</p>

<p>And, till she stoop, she must not be full-gorged,</p>

<p>For then she never looks upon her lure.</p>

<p>Another way I have to man my haggard,</p>

<p>To make her come and know her keeper’s call.</p>

<p>That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites</p>

<p>That bate and beat and will not be obedient.</p>

<p>She ate no meat today, nor none shall eat.</p>

<p>Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not.</p>

<p>As with the meat, some undeserved fault</p>

<p>I’ll find about the making of the bed,</p>

<p>And here I’ll fling the pillow, there the bolster,</p>

<p>This way the coverlet, another way the sheets.</p>

<p>Ay, and amid this hurly I intend</p>

<p>That all is done in reverend care of her.</p>

<p>And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night,</p>

<p>And, if she chance to nod, I’ll rail and brawl,</p>

<p>And with the clamor keep her still awake.</p>

<p>This is a way to kill a wife with kindness.</p>

<p>And thus I’ll curb her mad and headstrong humor.</p>

<p>He that knows better how to tame a shrew,</p>

<p>Now let him speak; ’tis charity to shew.</p>
