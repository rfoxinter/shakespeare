<p><center><i>[Enter Beggar (Christopher Sly) and Hostess.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  I’ll feeze you, in faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  A pair of stocks, you rogue!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  You’re a baggage! The Slys are no rogues. Look</p>

<p>in the chronicles. We came in with Richard Conqueror.</p>

<p>Therefore, paucas pallabris, let the world</p>

<p>slide. Sessa!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  You will not pay for the glasses you have</p>

<p>burst?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  No, not a denier. Go, by Saint Jeronimy! Go to</p>

<p>thy cold bed and warm thee.     <i><i>[He lies down.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hostess</sc>  I know my remedy. I must go fetch the</p>

<p>headborough.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I’ll answer him</p>

<p>by law. I’ll not budge an inch, boy. Let him come,</p>

<p>and kindly.     <i><i>[Falls asleep.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Wind horns within. Enter a Lord from hunting, with</p>

<p>his train.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Huntsman, I charge thee tender well my hounds.</p>

<p>Breathe Merriman (the poor cur is embossed)</p>

<p>And couple Clowder with the deep-mouthed brach.</p>

<p>Saw’st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good</p>

<p>At the hedge corner, in the coldest fault?</p>

<p>I would not lose the dog for twenty pound!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Huntsman</sc></p>

<p>Why, Bellman is as good as he, my lord.</p>

<p>He cried upon it at the merest loss,</p>

<p>And twice today picked out the dullest scent.</p>

<p>Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Thou art a fool. If Echo were as fleet,</p>

<p>I would esteem him worth a dozen such.</p>

<p>But sup them well, and look unto them all.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Huntsman</sc>  I will, my lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[First Huntsman exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc> <i>[noticing Sly]</i></p>

<p>What’s here? One dead, or drunk? See doth he</p>

<p>breathe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Huntsman</sc></p>

<p>He breathes, my lord. Were he not warmed with ale,</p>

<p>This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!</p>

<p>Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!</p>

<p>Sirs, I will practice on this drunken man.</p>

<p>What think you, if he were conveyed to bed,</p>

<p>Wrapped in sweet clothes, rings put upon his</p>

<p>fingers,</p>

<p>A most delicious banquet by his bed,</p>

<p>And brave attendants near him when he wakes,</p>

<p>Would not the beggar then forget himself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Huntsman</sc></p>

<p>Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Huntsman</sc></p>

<p>It would seem strange unto him when he waked.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Even as a flatt’ring dream or worthless fancy.</p>

<p>Then take him up, and manage well the jest.</p>

<p>Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,</p>

<p>And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;</p>

<p>Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,</p>

<p>And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;</p>

<p>Procure me music ready when he wakes</p>

<p>To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound.</p>

<p>And if he chance to speak, be ready straight</p>

<p>And, with a low, submissive reverence,</p>

<p>Say “What is it your Honor will command?”</p>

<p>Let one attend him with a silver basin</p>

<p>Full of rosewater and bestrewed with flowers,</p>

<p>Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,</p>

<p>And say “Will ’t please your Lordship cool your</p>

<p>hands?”</p>

<p>Someone be ready with a costly suit,</p>

<p>And ask him what apparel he will wear.</p>

<p>Another tell him of his hounds and horse,</p>

<p>And that his lady mourns at his disease.</p>

<p>Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,</p>

<p>And when he says he is, say that he dreams,</p>

<p>For he is nothing but a mighty lord.</p>

<p>This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs.</p>

<p>It will be pastime passing excellent</p>

<p>If it be husbanded with modesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Huntsman</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I warrant you we will play our part</p>

<p>As he shall think by our true diligence</p>

<p>He is no less than what we say he is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Take him up gently, and to bed with him,</p>

<p>And each one to his office when he wakes.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sly is carried out.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Sound trumpets within.]</i></center></p>

<p>Sirrah, go see what trumpet ’tis that sounds.</p>

<p><center><i>[Servingman exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Belike some noble gentleman that means</p>

<p>(Traveling some journey) to repose him here.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now? Who is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servingman</sc>  An ’t please your Honor, players</p>

<p>That offer service to your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Bid them come near.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Players.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now, fellows, you are welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Players</sc>  We thank your Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Do you intend to stay with me tonight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Player</sc></p>

<p>So please your Lordship to accept our duty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>With all my heart. This fellow I remember</p>

<p>Since once he played a farmer’s eldest son.–</p>

<p>’Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well.</p>

<p>I have forgot your name, but sure that part</p>

<p>Was aptly fitted and naturally performed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Player</sc></p>

<p>I think ’twas Soto that your Honor means.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>’Tis very true. Thou didst it excellent.</p>

<p>Well, you are come to me in happy time,</p>

<p>The rather for I have some sport in hand</p>

<p>Wherein your cunning can assist me much.</p>

<p>There is a lord will hear you play tonight;</p>

<p>But I am doubtful of your modesties,</p>

<p>Lest, over-eying of his odd behavior</p>

<p>(For yet his Honor never heard a play),</p>

<p>You break into some merry passion,</p>

<p>And so offend him. For I tell you, sirs,</p>

<p>If you should smile, he grows impatient.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Player</sc></p>

<p>Fear not, my lord, we can contain ourselves</p>

<p>Were he the veriest antic in the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc> <i>[to a Servingman]</i></p>

<p>Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery</p>

<p>And give them friendly welcome every one.</p>

<p>Let them want nothing that my house affords.</p>

<p><center><i>[One exits with the Players.]</i></center></p>

<p>Sirrah, go you to Bartholomew, my page,</p>

<p>And see him dressed in all suits like a lady.</p>

<p>That done, conduct him to the drunkard’s chamber,</p>

<p>And call him “Madam,” do him obeisance.</p>

<p>Tell him from me, as he will win my love,</p>

<p>He bear himself with honorable action,</p>

<p>Such as he hath observed in noble ladies</p>

<p>Unto their lords, by them accomplished.</p>

<p>Such duty to the drunkard let him do</p>

<p>With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,</p>

<p>And say “What is ’t your Honor will command,</p>

<p>Wherein your lady and your humble wife</p>

<p>May show her duty and make known her love?”</p>

<p>And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,</p>

<p>And with declining head into his bosom,</p>

<p>Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed</p>

<p>To see her noble lord restored to health,</p>

<p>Who, for this seven years, hath esteemed him</p>

<p>No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.</p>

<p>And if the boy have not a woman’s gift</p>

<p>To rain a shower of commanded tears,</p>

<p>An onion will do well for such a shift,</p>

<p>Which (in a napkin being close conveyed)</p>

<p>Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.</p>

<p>See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst.</p>

<p>Anon I’ll give thee more instructions.</p>

<p><center><i>[A Servingman exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>I know the boy will well usurp the grace,</p>

<p>Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman.</p>

<p>I long to hear him call the drunkard “husband”!</p>

<p>And how my men will stay themselves from</p>

<p>laughter</p>

<p>When they do homage to this simple peasant,</p>

<p>I’ll in to counsel them. Haply my presence</p>

<p>May well abate the over-merry spleen</p>

<p>Which otherwise would grow into extremes.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
