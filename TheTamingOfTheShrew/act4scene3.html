<p><center><i>[Enter Katherine and Grumio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc></p>

<p>No, no, forsooth, I dare not for my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.</p>

<p>What, did he marry me to famish me?</p>

<p>Beggars that come unto my father’s door</p>

<p>Upon entreaty have a present alms.</p>

<p>If not, elsewhere they meet with charity.</p>

<p>But I, who never knew how to entreat,</p>

<p>Nor never needed that I should entreat,</p>

<p>Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,</p>

<p>With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed.</p>

<p>And that which spites me more than all these wants,</p>

<p>He does it under name of perfect love,</p>

<p>As who should say, if I should sleep or eat</p>

<p>’Twere deadly sickness or else present death.</p>

<p>I prithee, go, and get me some repast,</p>

<p>I care not what, so it be wholesome food.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  What say you to a neat’s foot?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>’Tis passing good. I prithee let me have it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc></p>

<p>I fear it is too choleric a meat.</p>

<p>How say you to a fat tripe finely broiled?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>I like it well. Good Grumio, fetch it me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc></p>

<p>I cannot tell. I fear ’tis choleric.</p>

<p>What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>A dish that I do love to feed upon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc></p>

<p>Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc></p>

<p>Nay then, I will not. You shall have the mustard</p>

<p>Or else you get no beef of Grumio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc></p>

<p>Why then, the mustard without the beef.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,</p>

<p><center><i>[She beats him.]</i></center></p>

<p>That feed’st me with the very name of meat.</p>

<p>Sorrow on thee, and all the pack of you</p>

<p>That triumph thus upon my misery.</p>

<p>Go, get thee gone, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Petruchio and Hortensio with meat.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc></p>

<p>Mistress, what cheer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Faith, as cold as can be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Pluck up thy spirits. Look cheerfully upon me.</p>

<p>Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,</p>

<p>To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee.</p>

<p>I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.</p>

<p>What, not a word? Nay then, thou lov’st it not,</p>

<p>And all my pains is sorted to no proof.</p>

<p>Here, take away this dish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  I pray you, let it stand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>The poorest service is repaid with thanks,</p>

<p>And so shall mine before you touch the meat.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  I thank you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc></p>

<p>Signior Petruchio, fie, you are to blame.</p>

<p>Come, Mistress Kate, I’ll bear you company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc> <i>[aside to Hortensio]</i></p>

<p>Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.–</p>

<p>Much good do it unto thy gentle heart.</p>

<p>Kate, eat apace.</p>

<p><center><i>[Katherine and Hortensio prepare to eat.]</i></center></p>

<p>And now, my honey love,</p>

<p>Will we return unto thy father’s house</p>

<p>And revel it as bravely as the best,</p>

<p>With silken coats and caps and golden rings,</p>

<p>With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things,</p>

<p>With scarves and fans and double change of brav’ry,</p>

<p>With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav’ry.</p>

<p>What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure</p>

<p>To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Tailor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments.</p>

<p>Lay forth the gown.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Haberdasher.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What news with you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Haberdasher</sc></p>

<p>Here is the cap your Worship did bespeak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Why, this was molded on a porringer!</p>

<p>A velvet dish! Fie, fie, ’tis lewd and filthy.</p>

<p>Why, ’tis a cockle or a walnut shell,</p>

<p>A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby’s cap.</p>

<p>Away with it! Come, let me have a bigger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>I’ll have no bigger. This doth fit the time,</p>

<p>And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>When you are gentle, you shall have one too,</p>

<p>And not till then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  That will not be in haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak,</p>

<p>And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.</p>

<p>Your betters have endured me say my mind,</p>

<p>And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.</p>

<p>My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,</p>

<p>Or else my heart, concealing it, will break,</p>

<p>And, rather than it shall, I will be free</p>

<p>Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Why, thou sayst true. It is a paltry cap,</p>

<p>A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie.</p>

<p>I love thee well in that thou lik’st it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Love me, or love me not, I like the cap,</p>

<p>And it I will have, or I will have none.</p>

<p><center><i>[Exit Haberdasher.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Thy gown? Why, ay. Come, tailor, let us see ’t.</p>

<p>O mercy God, what masking-stuff is here?</p>

<p>What’s this? A sleeve? ’Tis like a demi-cannon.</p>

<p>What, up and down carved like an apple tart?</p>

<p>Here’s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,</p>

<p>Like to a censer in a barber’s shop.</p>

<p>Why, what a devil’s name, tailor, call’st thou this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I see she’s like to have neither cap nor gown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tailor</sc></p>

<p>You bid me make it orderly and well,</p>

<p>According to the fashion and the time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Marry, and did. But if you be remembered,</p>

<p>I did not bid you mar it to the time.</p>

<p>Go, hop me over every kennel home,</p>

<p>For you shall hop without my custom, sir.</p>

<p>I’ll none of it. Hence, make your best of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>I never saw a better-fashioned gown,</p>

<p>More quaint, more pleasing, nor more</p>

<p>commendable.</p>

<p>Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Why, true, he means to make a puppet of thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tailor</sc></p>

<p>She says your Worship means to make a puppet of</p>

<p>her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,</p>

<p>thou thimble,</p>

<p>Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!</p>

<p>Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter cricket, thou!</p>

<p>Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?</p>

<p>Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant,</p>

<p>Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard</p>

<p>As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv’st.</p>

<p>I tell thee, I, that thou hast marred her gown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tailor</sc></p>

<p>Your Worship is deceived. The gown is made</p>

<p>Just as my master had direction.</p>

<p>Grumio gave order how it should be done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  I gave him no order. I gave him the stuff.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tailor</sc></p>

<p>But how did you desire it should be made?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Marry, sir, with needle and thread.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tailor</sc></p>

<p>But did you not request to have it cut?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Thou hast faced many things.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tailor</sc>  I have.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Face not me. Thou hast braved many men;</p>

<p>brave not me. I will neither be faced nor braved. I</p>

<p>say unto thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown,</p>

<p>but I did not bid him cut it to pieces. Ergo, thou</p>

<p>liest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tailor</sc>  Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.</p>

<p><center><i>[He shows a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc>  Read it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  The note lies in ’s throat, if he say I said so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tailor</sc> <i>[reads]</i>  “Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown–”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Master, if ever I said “loose-bodied gown,”</p>

<p>sew me in the skirts of it and beat me to death with</p>

<p>a bottom of brown thread. I said “a gown.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc>  Proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tailor</sc> <i>[reads]</i>  “With a small-compassed cape–”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  I confess the cape.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tailor</sc> <i>[reads]</i>  “With a trunk sleeve–”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  I confess two sleeves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tailor</sc> <i>[reads]</i>  “The sleeves curiously cut.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc>  Ay, there’s the villainy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Error i’ th’ bill, sir, error i’ th’ bill! I commanded</p>

<p>the sleeves should be cut out and sewed</p>

<p>up again, and that I’ll prove upon thee, though thy</p>

<p>little finger be armed in a thimble.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tailor</sc>  This is true that I say. An I had thee in place</p>

<p>where, thou shouldst know it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  I am for thee straight. Take thou the bill, give</p>

<p>me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc>  God-a-mercy, Grumio, then he shall have</p>

<p>no odds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  You are i’ th’ right, sir, ’tis for my mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Go, take it up unto thy master’s use.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress’</p>

<p>gown for thy master’s use!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc>  Why, sir, what’s your conceit in that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think</p>

<p>for. Take up my mistress’ gown to his master’s use!</p>

<p>O, fie, fie, fie!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc> <i>[aside to Hortensio]</i></p>

<p>Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.</p>

<p><i>[To Tailor.]</i> Go, take it hence. Begone, and say no</p>

<p>more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc> <i>[aside to Tailor]</i></p>

<p>Tailor, I’ll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow.</p>

<p>Take no unkindness of his hasty words.</p>

<p>Away, I say. Commend me to thy master.</p>

<p><center><i>[Tailor exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Well, come, my Kate, we will unto your father’s,</p>

<p>Even in these honest mean habiliments.</p>

<p>Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor,</p>

<p>For ’tis the mind that makes the body rich,</p>

<p>And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,</p>

<p>So honor peereth in the meanest habit.</p>

<p>What, is the jay more precious than the lark</p>

<p>Because his feathers are more beautiful?</p>

<p>Or is the adder better than the eel</p>

<p>Because his painted skin contents the eye?</p>

<p>O no, good Kate. Neither art thou the worse</p>

<p>For this poor furniture and mean array.</p>

<p>If thou account’st it shame, lay it on me,</p>

<p>And therefore frolic! We will hence forthwith</p>

<p>To feast and sport us at thy father’s house.</p>

<p><i>[To Grumio.]</i> Go, call my men, and let us straight to</p>

<p>him,</p>

<p>And bring our horses unto Long-lane end.</p>

<p>There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.</p>

<p>Let’s see, I think ’tis now some seven o’clock,</p>

<p>And well we may come there by dinner time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>I dare assure you, sir, ’tis almost two,</p>

<p>And ’twill be supper time ere you come there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>It shall be seven ere I go to horse.</p>

<p>Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,</p>

<p>You are still crossing it.–Sirs, let ’t alone.</p>

<p>I will not go today, and, ere I do,</p>

<p>It shall be what o’clock I say it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Why, so, this gallant will command the sun!</p>
