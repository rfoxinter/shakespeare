<p><center><i>[Enter Katherine and Bianca with her hands tied.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,</p>

<p>To make a bondmaid and a slave of me.</p>

<p>That I disdain. But for these other goods–</p>

<p>Unbind my hands, I’ll pull them off myself,</p>

<p>Yea, all my raiment to my petticoat,</p>

<p>Or what you will command me will I do,</p>

<p>So well I know my duty to my elders.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell</p>

<p>Whom thou lov’st best. See thou dissemble not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>Believe me, sister, of all the men alive</p>

<p>I never yet beheld that special face</p>

<p>Which I could fancy more than any other.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Minion, thou liest. Is ’t not Hortensio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>If you affect him, sister, here I swear</p>

<p>I’ll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>O, then belike you fancy riches more.</p>

<p>You will have Gremio to keep you fair.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>Is it for him you do envy me so?</p>

<p>Nay, then, you jest, and now I well perceive</p>

<p>You have but jested with me all this while.</p>

<p>I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.</p>

<p><center><i>[Katherine strikes her.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>If that be jest, then all the rest was so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Baptista.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Why, how now, dame, whence grows this</p>

<p>insolence?–</p>

<p>Bianca, stand aside.–Poor girl, she weeps!</p>

<p><center><i>[He unties her hands.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Bianca.]</i> Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.</p>

<p><i>[To Katherine.]</i> For shame, thou hilding of a devilish</p>

<p>spirit!</p>

<p>Why dost thou wrong her that did ne’er wrong</p>

<p>thee?</p>

<p>When did she cross thee with a bitter word?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Her silence flouts me, and I’ll be revenged!</p>

<p><center><i>[She flies after Bianca.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>What, in my sight?–Bianca, get thee in.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bianca exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see</p>

<p>She is your treasure, she must have a husband,</p>

<p>I must dance barefoot on her wedding day</p>

<p>And, for your love to her, lead apes in hell.</p>

<p>Talk not to me. I will go sit and weep</p>

<p>Till I can find occasion of revenge.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?</p>

<p>But who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gremio; Lucentio disguised as Cambio</p>

<p>in the habit of a mean man; Petruchio with</p>

<p>Hortensio disguised as Litio; and Tranio disguised</p>

<p>as Lucentio, with his boy, Biondello bearing a lute</p>

<p>and books.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span>  Good morrow, neighbor Baptista.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span>  Good morrow, neighbor Gremio.–God</p>

<p>save you, gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>And you, good sir. Pray, have you not a daughter</p>

<p>Called Katherina, fair and virtuous?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>I have a daughter, sir, called Katherina.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span> <i>[to Petruchio]</i></p>

<p>You are too blunt. Go to it orderly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>You wrong me, Signior Gremio. Give me leave.–</p>

<p>I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,</p>

<p>That hearing of her beauty and her wit,</p>

<p>Her affability and bashful modesty,</p>

<p>Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,</p>

<p>Am bold to show myself a forward guest</p>

<p>Within your house, to make mine eye the witness</p>

<p>Of that report which I so oft have heard,</p>

<p>And, for an entrance to my entertainment,</p>

<p>I do present you with a man of mine,</p>

<p><center><i>[Presenting Hortensio, disguised as Litio]</i></center></p>

<p>Cunning in music and the mathematics,</p>

<p>To instruct her fully in those sciences,</p>

<p>Whereof I know she is not ignorant.</p>

<p>Accept of him, or else you do me wrong.</p>

<p>His name is Litio, born in Mantua.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>You’re welcome, sir, and he for your good sake.</p>

<p>But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,</p>

<p>She is not for your turn, the more my grief.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>I see you do not mean to part with her,</p>

<p>Or else you like not of my company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Mistake me not. I speak but as I find.</p>

<p>Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Petruchio is my name, Antonio’s son,</p>

<p>A man well known throughout all Italy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>I know him well. You are welcome for his sake.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray</p>

<p>Let us that are poor petitioners speak too!</p>

<p>Bacare, you are marvelous forward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>O, pardon me, Signior Gremio, I would fain be</p>

<p>doing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>I doubt it not, sir. But you will curse your wooing.</p>

<p><i>[To Baptista.]</i> Neighbor, this is a gift very grateful,</p>

<p>I am sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,</p>

<p>that have been more kindly beholding to you than</p>

<p>any, freely give unto you this young scholar <i>[presenting</p>

<p>Lucentio, disguised as Cambio]</i> that hath</p>

<p>been long studying at Rheims, as cunning in Greek,</p>

<p>Latin, and other languages as the other in music and</p>

<p>mathematics. His name is Cambio. Pray accept his</p>

<p>service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span>  A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.–Welcome,</p>

<p>good Cambio. <i>[To Tranio as Lucentio.]</i> But,</p>

<p>gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger. May I</p>

<p>be so bold to know the cause of your coming?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,</p>

<p>That being a stranger in this city here</p>

<p>Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,</p>

<p>Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.</p>

<p>Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,</p>

<p>In the preferment of the eldest sister.</p>

<p>This liberty is all that I request,</p>

<p>That, upon knowledge of my parentage,</p>

<p>I may have welcome ’mongst the rest that woo</p>

<p>And free access and favor as the rest.</p>

<p>And toward the education of your daughters</p>

<p>I here bestow a simple instrument</p>

<p>And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.</p>

<p><center><i>[Biondello comes forward with the gifts.]</i></center></p>

<p>If you accept them, then their worth is great.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Lucentio is your name. Of whence, I pray?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>A mighty man of Pisa. By report</p>

<p>I know him well. You are very welcome, sir.</p>

<p><i>[To Hortensio as Litio.]</i> Take you the lute,</p>

<p><i>[To Lucentio as Cambio.]</i> and you the set of books.</p>

<p>You shall go see your pupils presently.</p>

<p>Holla, within!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Sirrah, lead these gentlemen</p>

<p>To my daughters, and tell them both</p>

<p>These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.</p>

<p><center><i>[Servant exits with Hortensio and Lucentio.]</i></center></p>

<p>We will go walk a little in the orchard,</p>

<p>And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,</p>

<p>And so I pray you all to think yourselves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,</p>

<p>And every day I cannot come to woo.</p>

<p>You knew my father well, and in him me,</p>

<p>Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,</p>

<p>Which I have bettered rather than decreased.</p>

<p>Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love,</p>

<p>What dowry shall I have with her to wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>After my death, the one half of my lands,</p>

<p>And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>And, for that dowry, I’ll assure her of</p>

<p>Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,</p>

<p>In all my lands and leases whatsoever.</p>

<p>Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,</p>

<p>That covenants may be kept on either hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Ay, when the special thing is well obtained,</p>

<p>That is, her love, for that is all in all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Why, that is nothing. For I tell you, father,</p>

<p>I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;</p>

<p>And where two raging fires meet together,</p>

<p>They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.</p>

<p>Though little fire grows great with little wind,</p>

<p>Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.</p>

<p>So I to her and so she yields to me,</p>

<p>For I am rough and woo not like a babe.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed.</p>

<p>But be thou armed for some unhappy words.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,</p>

<p>That shakes not, though they blow perpetually.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hortensio as Litio with his head broke.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span> <i>[as Litio]</i></p>

<p>For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>What, will my daughter prove a good musician?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span> <i>[as Litio]</i></p>

<p>I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier!</p>

<p>Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span> <i>[as Litio]</i></p>

<p>Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me.</p>

<p>I did but tell her she mistook her frets,</p>

<p>And bowed her hand to teach her fingering,</p>

<p>When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,</p>

<p>“ ’Frets’ call you these?” quoth she. “I’ll fume with</p>

<p>them!”</p>

<p>And with that word she struck me on the head,</p>

<p>And through the instrument my pate made way,</p>

<p>And there I stood amazed for a while,</p>

<p>As on a pillory, looking through the lute,</p>

<p>While she did call me “rascal fiddler,”</p>

<p>And “twangling Jack,” with twenty such vile terms,</p>

<p>As had she studied to misuse me so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench.</p>

<p>I love her ten times more than ere I did.</p>

<p>O, how I long to have some chat with her!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span> <i>[to Hortensio as Litio]</i></p>

<p>Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited.</p>

<p>Proceed in practice with my younger daughter.</p>

<p>She’s apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.–</p>

<p>Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,</p>

<p>Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>I pray you do. I’ll attend her here–</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Petruchio exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>And woo her with some spirit when she comes!</p>

<p>Say that she rail, why then I’ll tell her plain</p>

<p>She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.</p>

<p>Say that she frown, I’ll say she looks as clear</p>

<p>As morning roses newly washed with dew.</p>

<p>Say she be mute and will not speak a word,</p>

<p>Then I’ll commend her volubility</p>

<p>And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.</p>

<p>If she do bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks</p>

<p>As though she bid me stay by her a week.</p>

<p>If she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day</p>

<p>When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.</p>

<p>But here she comes–and now, Petruchio, speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Katherine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Good morrow, Kate, for that’s your name, I hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing.</p>

<p>They call me Katherine that do talk of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>You lie, in faith, for you are called plain Kate,</p>

<p>And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst.</p>

<p>But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,</p>

<p>Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate</p>

<p>(For dainties are all Kates)–and therefore, Kate,</p>

<p>Take this of me, Kate of my consolation:</p>

<p>Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,</p>

<p>Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded</p>

<p>(Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs),</p>

<p>Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>“Moved,” in good time! Let him that moved you</p>

<p>hither</p>

<p>Remove you hence. I knew you at the first</p>

<p>You were a movable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Why, what’s a movable?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  A joint stool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Asses are made to bear, and so are you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Women are made to bear, and so are you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>No such jade as you, if me you mean.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee,</p>

<p>For knowing thee to be but young and light–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Too light for such a swain as you to catch,</p>

<p>And yet as heavy as my weight should be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>“Should be”–should buzz!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  Well ta’en, and like a</p>

<p>buzzard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>O slow-winged turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Come, come, you wasp! I’ faith, you are too angry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>If I be waspish, best beware my sting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>My remedy is then to pluck it out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?</p>

<p>In his tail.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  In his tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  Whose tongue?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Yours, if you talk of tales, and so farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  What, with my tongue in your tail?</p>

<p>Nay, come again, good Kate. I am a gentleman–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  That I’ll try.     <i><i>[She strikes him.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>I swear I’ll cuff you if you strike again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  So may you lose your arms.</p>

<p>If you strike me, you are no gentleman,</p>

<p>And if no gentleman, why then no arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  What is your crest? A coxcomb?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>No cock of mine. You crow too like a craven.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Nay, come, Kate, come. You must not look so sour.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>It is my fashion when I see a crab.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Why, here’s no crab, and therefore look not sour.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  There is, there is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Then show it me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  Had I a glass, I would.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  What, you mean my face?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  Well aimed of such a young one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Yet you are withered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  ’Tis with cares.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  I care not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Nay, hear you, Kate–in sooth, you ’scape not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>I chafe you if I tarry. Let me go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>No, not a whit. I find you passing gentle.</p>

<p>’Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,</p>

<p>And now I find report a very liar.</p>

<p>For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing</p>

<p>courteous,</p>

<p>But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.</p>

<p>Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,</p>

<p>Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will,</p>

<p>Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk.</p>

<p>But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers,</p>

<p>With gentle conference, soft, and affable.</p>

<p>Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?</p>

<p>O sland’rous world! Kate like the hazel twig</p>

<p>Is straight, and slender, and as brown in hue</p>

<p>As hazelnuts, and sweeter than the kernels.</p>

<p>O, let me see thee walk! Thou dost not halt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Go, fool, and whom thou keep’st command.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Did ever Dian so become a grove</p>

<p>As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?</p>

<p>O, be thou Dian and let her be Kate,</p>

<p>And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Where did you study all this goodly speech?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>It is extempore, from my mother wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>A witty mother, witless else her son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  Am I not wise?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  Yes, keep you warm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.</p>

<p>And therefore, setting all this chat aside,</p>

<p>Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented</p>

<p>That you shall be my wife, your dowry ’greed on,</p>

<p>And, will you, nill you, I will marry you.</p>

<p>Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn,</p>

<p>For by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,</p>

<p>Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,</p>

<p>Thou must be married to no man but me.</p>

<p>For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,</p>

<p>And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate</p>

<p>Conformable as other household Kates.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Baptista, Gremio, and Tranio as Lucentio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes your father. Never make denial.</p>

<p>I must and will have Katherine to my wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my</p>

<p>daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  How but well, sir? How but well?</p>

<p>It were impossible I should speed amiss.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Why, how now, daughter Katherine? In your</p>

<p>dumps?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Call you me daughter? Now I promise you</p>

<p>You have showed a tender fatherly regard,</p>

<p>To wish me wed to one half lunatic,</p>

<p>A madcap ruffian and a swearing Jack,</p>

<p>That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Father, ’tis thus: yourself and all the world</p>

<p>That talked of her have talked amiss of her.</p>

<p>If she be curst, it is for policy,</p>

<p>For she’s not froward, but modest as the dove;</p>

<p>She is not hot, but temperate as the morn.</p>

<p>For patience she will prove a second Grissel,</p>

<p>And Roman Lucrece for her chastity.</p>

<p>And to conclude, we have ’greed so well together</p>

<p>That upon Sunday is the wedding day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>I’ll see thee hanged on Sunday first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span>  Hark, Petruchio, she says she’ll see thee</p>

<p>hanged first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i>  Is this your speeding? Nay,</p>

<p>then, goodnight our part.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself.</p>

<p>If she and I be pleased, what’s that to you?</p>

<p>’Tis bargained ’twixt us twain, being alone,</p>

<p>That she shall still be curst in company.</p>

<p>I tell you, ’tis incredible to believe</p>

<p>How much she loves me. O, the kindest Kate!</p>

<p>She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss</p>

<p>She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,</p>

<p>That in a twink she won me to her love.</p>

<p>O, you are novices! ’Tis a world to see</p>

<p>How tame, when men and women are alone,</p>

<p>A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.–</p>

<p>Give me thy hand, Kate. I will unto Venice</p>

<p>To buy apparel ’gainst the wedding day.–</p>

<p>Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests.</p>

<p>I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>I know not what to say, but give me your hands.</p>

<p>God send you joy, Petruchio. ’Tis a match.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span> and <span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Amen, say we. We will be witnesses.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.</p>

<p>I will to Venice. Sunday comes apace.</p>

<p>We will have rings, and things, and fine array,</p>

<p>And kiss me, Kate. We will be married o’ Sunday.</p>

<p><center><i>[Petruchio and Katherine exit</p>

<p>through different doors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>Was ever match clapped up so suddenly?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant’s part</p>

<p>And venture madly on a desperate mart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>’Twas a commodity lay fretting by you.</p>

<p>’Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>The gain I seek, is quiet in the match.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.</p>

<p>But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter.</p>

<p>Now is the day we long have looked for.</p>

<p>I am your neighbor and was suitor first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>And I am one that love Bianca more</p>

<p>Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span>  But thine doth fry!</p>

<p>Skipper, stand back. ’Tis age that nourisheth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>But youth in ladies’ eyes that flourisheth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Content you, gentlemen. I will compound this strife.</p>

<p>’Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both</p>

<p>That can assure my daughter greatest dower</p>

<p>Shall have my Bianca’s love.</p>

<p>Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>First, as you know, my house within the city</p>

<p>Is richly furnished with plate and gold,</p>

<p>Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;</p>

<p>My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;</p>

<p>In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns,</p>

<p>In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,</p>

<p>Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,</p>

<p>Fine linen, Turkey cushions bossed with pearl,</p>

<p>Valance of Venice gold in needlework,</p>

<p>Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs</p>

<p>To house or housekeeping. Then, at my farm</p>

<p>I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,</p>

<p>Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,</p>

<p>And all things answerable to this portion.</p>

<p>Myself am struck in years, I must confess,</p>

<p>And if I die tomorrow this is hers,</p>

<p>If whilst I live she will be only mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>That “only” came well in. <i>[To Baptista.]</i> Sir, list to</p>

<p>me:</p>

<p>I am my father’s heir and only son.</p>

<p>If I may have your daughter to my wife,</p>

<p>I’ll leave her houses three or four as good,</p>

<p>Within rich Pisa walls, as any one</p>

<p>Old Signior Gremio has in Padua,</p>

<p>Besides two thousand ducats by the year</p>

<p>Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.–</p>

<p>What, have I pinched you, Signior Gremio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>Two thousand ducats by the year of land?</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> My land amounts not to so much in all.–</p>

<p>That she shall have, besides an argosy</p>

<p>That now is lying in Marcellus’ road.</p>

<p><i>[To Tranio.]</i> What, have I choked you with an argosy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Gremio, ’tis known my father hath no less</p>

<p>Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses</p>

<p>And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,</p>

<p>And twice as much whate’er thou off’rest next.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>Nay, I have offered all. I have no more,</p>

<p>And she can have no more than all I have.</p>

<p><i>[To Baptista.]</i> If you like me, she shall have me and</p>

<p>mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Why, then, the maid is mine from all the world,</p>

<p>By your firm promise. Gremio is outvied.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>I must confess your offer is the best,</p>

<p>And, let your father make her the assurance,</p>

<p>She is your own; else, you must pardon me.</p>

<p>If you should die before him, where’s her dower?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>That’s but a cavil. He is old, I young.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>And may not young men die as well as old?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, I am thus resolved:</p>

<p>On Sunday next, you know</p>

<p>My daughter Katherine is to be married.</p>

<p><i>[To Tranio as Lucentio.]</i> Now, on the Sunday</p>

<p>following, shall Bianca</p>

<p>Be bride to you, if you make this assurance.</p>

<p>If not, to Signior Gremio.</p>

<p>And so I take my leave, and thank you both.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>Adieu, good neighbor.     <i><i>[Baptista exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Now I fear thee not.</p>

<p>Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool</p>

<p>To give thee all and in his waning age</p>

<p>Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!</p>

<p>An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gremio exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span></p>

<p>A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!–</p>

<p>Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.</p>

<p>’Tis in my head to do my master good.</p>

<p>I see no reason but supposed Lucentio</p>

<p>Must get a father, called “supposed Vincentio”–</p>

<p>And that’s a wonder. Fathers commonly</p>

<p>Do get their children. But in this case of wooing,</p>

<p>A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
