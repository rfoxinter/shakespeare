<p><center><i>[Enter Baptista, Vincentio, Gremio, the Merchant,</p>

<p>Lucentio, and Bianca; Hortensio and the Widow,</p>

<p>Petruchio and Katherine; Tranio, Biondello, and</p>

<p>Grumio, with Servingmen bringing in a banquet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span></p>

<p>At last, though long, our jarring notes agree,</p>

<p>And time it is when raging war is done</p>

<p>To smile at ’scapes and perils overblown.</p>

<p>My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,</p>

<p>While I with selfsame kindness welcome thine.</p>

<p>Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,</p>

<p>And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,</p>

<p>Feast with the best, and welcome to my house.</p>

<p>My banquet is to close our stomachs up</p>

<p>After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down,</p>

<p>For now we sit to chat as well as eat.     <i><i>[They sit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Padua affords nothing but what is kind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>For both our sakes I would that word were true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Widow</span></p>

<p>Then never trust me if I be afeard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:</p>

<p>I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Widow</span></p>

<p>He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Roundly replied.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  Mistress, how mean you that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Widow</span>  Thus I conceive by him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Conceives by me? How likes Hortensio that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>“He that is giddy thinks the world turns round”–</p>

<p>I pray you tell me what you meant by that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Widow</span></p>

<p>Your husband being troubled with a shrew</p>

<p>Measures my husband’s sorrow by his woe.</p>

<p>And now you know my meaning.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>A very mean meaning.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Widow</span>  Right, I mean you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>And I am mean indeed, respecting you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  To her, Kate!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span>  To her, widow!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span>  That’s my office.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Spoke like an officer! Ha’ to thee, lad.</p>

<p><center><i>[He drinks to Hortensio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>Believe me, sir, they butt together well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>Head and butt! An hasty-witted body</p>

<p>Would say your head and butt were head and horn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vincentio</span></p>

<p>Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>Ay, but not frighted me. Therefore I’ll sleep again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Nay, that you shall not. Since you have begun,</p>

<p>Have at you for a bitter jest or two.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,</p>

<p>And then pursue me as you draw your bow.–</p>

<p>You are welcome all.     <i><i>[Bianca, Katherine, and the Widow exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio,</p>

<p>This bird you aimed at, though you hit her not.–</p>

<p>Therefore a health to all that shot and missed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span></p>

<p>O, sir, Lucentio slipped me like his greyhound,</p>

<p>Which runs himself and catches for his master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>A good swift simile, but something currish.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span></p>

<p>’Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself.</p>

<p>’Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>O, O, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span></p>

<p>I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Confess, confess! Hath he not hit you here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>He has a little galled me, I confess.</p>

<p>And as the jest did glance away from me,</p>

<p>’Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,</p>

<p>I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Well, I say no. And therefore, for assurance,</p>

<p>Let’s each one send unto his wife,</p>

<p>And he whose wife is most obedient</p>

<p>To come at first when he doth send for her</p>

<p>Shall win the wager which we will propose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Content, what’s the wager?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span>  Twenty crowns.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  Twenty crowns?</p>

<p>I’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound,</p>

<p>But twenty times so much upon my wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span></p>

<p>A hundred, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span>  Content.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  A match! ’Tis done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span>  Who shall begin?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span>  That will I.</p>

<p>Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span>  I go.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Son, I’ll be your half Bianca comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span></p>

<p>I’ll have no halves. I’ll bear it all myself.</p>

<p><center><i>[Enter Biondello.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span>  Sir, my mistress sends you</p>

<p>word</p>

<p>That she is busy, and she cannot come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>How? “She’s busy, and she cannot come”?</p>

<p>Is that an answer?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span>  Ay, and a kind one, too.</p>

<p>Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  I hope better.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife</p>

<p>To come to me forthwith.     <i><i>[Biondello exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  O ho, entreat her!</p>

<p>Nay, then, she must needs come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span>  I am afraid, sir,</p>

<p>Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Biondello.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now, where’s my wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span></p>

<p>She says you have some goodly jest in hand.</p>

<p>She will not come. She bids you come to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  Worse and worse. She will not come!</p>

<p>O vile, intolerable, not to be endured!–</p>

<p>Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress,</p>

<p>Say I command her come to me.     <i><i>[Grumio exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>I know her answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  What?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span>  She will not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Katherine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Now by my holidam, here comes Katherina!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>What is your will, sir, that you send for me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Where is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>They sit conferring by the parlor fire.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Go fetch them hither. If they deny to come,</p>

<p>Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.</p>

<p>Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.</p>

<p><center><i>[Katherine exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span></p>

<p>Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,</p>

<p>An awful rule, and right supremacy,</p>

<p>And, to be short, what not that’s sweet and happy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!</p>

<p>The wager thou hast won, and I will add</p>

<p>Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns,</p>

<p>Another dowry to another daughter,</p>

<p>For she is changed as she had never been.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Nay, I will win my wager better yet,</p>

<p>And show more sign of her obedience,</p>

<p>Her new-built virtue and obedience.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Katherine, Bianca, and Widow.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>See where she comes, and brings your froward</p>

<p>wives</p>

<p>As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.–</p>

<p>Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not.</p>

<p>Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.</p>

<p><center><i>[She obeys.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Widow</span></p>

<p>Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh</p>

<p>Till I be brought to such a silly pass.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>Fie, what a foolish duty call you this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span></p>

<p>I would your duty were as foolish too.</p>

<p>The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,</p>

<p>Hath cost me a hundred crowns since suppertime.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>The more fool you for laying on my duty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Katherine, I charge thee tell these headstrong</p>

<p>women</p>

<p>What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Widow</span></p>

<p>Come, come, you’re mocking. We will have no</p>

<p>telling.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Come on, I say, and first begin with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Widow</span>  She shall not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>I say she shall.–And first begin with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Fie, fie! Unknit that threat’ning unkind brow,</p>

<p>And dart not scornful glances from those eyes</p>

<p>To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.</p>

<p>It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,</p>

<p>Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,</p>

<p>And in no sense is meet or amiable.</p>

<p>A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,</p>

<p>Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,</p>

<p>And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty</p>

<p>Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.</p>

<p>Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</p>

<p>Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee,</p>

<p>And for thy maintenance commits his body</p>

<p>To painful labor both by sea and land,</p>

<p>To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,</p>

<p>Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,</p>

<p>And craves no other tribute at thy hands</p>

<p>But love, fair looks, and true obedience–</p>

<p>Too little payment for so great a debt.</p>

<p>Such duty as the subject owes the prince,</p>

<p>Even such a woman oweth to her husband;</p>

<p>And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,</p>

<p>And not obedient to his honest will,</p>

<p>What is she but a foul contending rebel</p>

<p>And graceless traitor to her loving lord?</p>

<p>I am ashamed that women are so simple</p>

<p>To offer war where they should kneel for peace,</p>

<p>Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway</p>

<p>When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.</p>

<p>Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,</p>

<p>Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,</p>

<p>But that our soft conditions and our hearts</p>

<p>Should well agree with our external parts?</p>

<p>Come, come, you froward and unable worms!</p>

<p>My mind hath been as big as one of yours,</p>

<p>My heart as great, my reason haply more,</p>

<p>To bandy word for word and frown for frown;</p>

<p>But now I see our lances are but straws,</p>

<p>Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,</p>

<p>That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.</p>

<p>Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,</p>

<p>And place your hands below your husband’s foot;</p>

<p>In token of which duty, if he please,</p>

<p>My hand is ready, may it do him ease.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Why, there’s a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.</p>

<p><center><i>[They kiss.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span></p>

<p>Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vincentio</span></p>

<p>’Tis a good hearing when children are toward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span></p>

<p>But a harsh hearing when women are froward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.</p>

<p>We three are married, but you two are sped.</p>

<p><i>[To Lucentio.]</i> ’Twas I won the wager, though you</p>

<p>hit the white,</p>

<p>And being a winner, God give you good night.</p>

<p><center><i>[Petruchio and Katherine exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Now, go thy ways, thou hast tamed a curst shrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span></p>

<p>’Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
