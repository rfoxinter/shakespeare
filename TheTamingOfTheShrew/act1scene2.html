<p><center><i>[Enter Petruchio and his man Grumio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Verona, for a while I take my leave</p>

<p>To see my friends in Padua, but of all</p>

<p>My best beloved and approved friend,</p>

<p>Hortensio. And I trow this is his house.</p>

<p>Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span>  Knock, sir? Whom should I knock? Is there</p>

<p>any man has rebused your Worship?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span>  Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir,</p>

<p>that I should knock you here, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Villain, I say, knock me at this gate</p>

<p>And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span></p>

<p>My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock</p>

<p>you first,</p>

<p>And then I know after who comes by the worst.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  Will it not be?</p>

<p>Faith, sirrah, an you’ll not knock, I’ll ring it.</p>

<p>I’ll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.</p>

<p><center><i>[He wrings him by the ears. Grumio falls.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span>  Help, mistress, help! My master is mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  Now knock when I bid you, sirrah</p>

<p>villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hortensio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span>  How now, what’s the matter? My old</p>

<p>friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio? How</p>

<p>do you all at Verona?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?</p>

<p>Con tutto il cuore ben trovato, may I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span>  Alia nostra casa ben venuto, molto</p>

<p>honorato signor mio Petruchio.–Rise, Grumio,</p>

<p>rise. We will compound this quarrel.     <i><i>[Grumio rises.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span>  Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he ’leges in</p>

<p>Latin. If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave</p>

<p>his service–look you, sir: he bid me knock him</p>

<p>and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it fit for a</p>

<p>servant to use his master so, being perhaps, for</p>

<p>aught I see, two-and-thirty, a pip out?</p>

<p>Whom, would to God, I had well knocked at first,</p>

<p>Then had not Grumio come by the worst.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>A senseless villain, good Hortensio.</p>

<p>I bade the rascal knock upon your gate</p>

<p>And could not get him for my heart to do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span>  Knock at the gate? O, heavens, spake you not</p>

<p>these words plain: “Sirrah, knock me here, rap me</p>

<p>here, knock me well, and knock me soundly”? And</p>

<p>come you now with “knocking at the gate”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Sirrah, begone, or talk not, I advise you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Petruchio, patience. I am Grumio’s pledge.</p>

<p>Why, this’ a heavy chance ’twixt him and you,</p>

<p>Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.</p>

<p>And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale</p>

<p>Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Such wind as scatters young men through the world</p>

<p>To seek their fortunes farther than at home,</p>

<p>Where small experience grows. But in a few,</p>

<p>Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:</p>

<p>Antonio, my father, is deceased,</p>

<p>And I have thrust myself into this maze,</p>

<p>Happily to wive and thrive, as best I may.</p>

<p>Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,</p>

<p>And so am come abroad to see the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee</p>

<p>And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favored wife?</p>

<p>Thou ’dst thank me but a little for my counsel–</p>

<p>And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich,</p>

<p>And very rich. But thou ’rt too much my friend,</p>

<p>And I’ll not wish thee to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Signior Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we</p>

<p>Few words suffice. And therefore, if thou know</p>

<p>One rich enough to be Petruchio’s wife</p>

<p>(As wealth is burden of my wooing dance),</p>

<p>Be she as foul as was Florentius’ love,</p>

<p>As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd</p>

<p>As Socrates’ Xanthippe, or a worse,</p>

<p>She moves me not, or not removes at least</p>

<p>Affection’s edge in me, were she as rough</p>

<p>As are the swelling Adriatic seas.</p>

<p>I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;</p>

<p>If wealthily, then happily in Padua.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span> <i>[to Hortensio]</i>  Nay, look you, sir, he tells you</p>

<p>flatly what his mind is. Why, give him gold enough</p>

<p>and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an</p>

<p>old trot with ne’er a tooth in her head, though she</p>

<p>have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses. Why,</p>

<p>nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Petruchio, since we are stepped thus far in,</p>

<p>I will continue that I broached in jest.</p>

<p>I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife</p>

<p>With wealth enough, and young and beauteous,</p>

<p>Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.</p>

<p>Her only fault, and that is faults enough,</p>

<p>Is that she is intolerable curst,</p>

<p>And shrewd, and froward, so beyond all measure</p>

<p>That, were my state far worser than it is,</p>

<p>I would not wed her for a mine of gold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Hortensio, peace. Thou know’st not gold’s effect.</p>

<p>Tell me her father’s name, and ’tis enough;</p>

<p>For I will board her, though she chide as loud</p>

<p>As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Her father is Baptista Minola,</p>

<p>An affable and courteous gentleman.</p>

<p>Her name is Katherina Minola,</p>

<p>Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>I know her father, though I know not her,</p>

<p>And he knew my deceased father well.</p>

<p>I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her,</p>

<p>And therefore let me be thus bold with you</p>

<p>To give you over at this first encounter–</p>

<p>Unless you will accompany me thither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span> <i>[to Hortensio]</i>  I pray you, sir, let him go while</p>

<p>the humor lasts. O’ my word, an she knew him as</p>

<p>well as I do, she would think scolding would do little</p>

<p>good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a</p>

<p>score knaves or so. Why, that’s nothing; an he begin</p>

<p>once, he’ll rail in his rope tricks. I’ll tell you what,</p>

<p>sir, an she stand him but a little, he will throw a</p>

<p>figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that</p>

<p>she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.</p>

<p>You know him not, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Tarry, Petruchio. I must go with thee,</p>

<p>For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is.</p>

<p>He hath the jewel of my life in hold,</p>

<p>His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,</p>

<p>And her withholds from me and other more,</p>

<p>Suitors to her and rivals in my love,</p>

<p>Supposing it a thing impossible,</p>

<p>For those defects I have before rehearsed,</p>

<p>That ever Katherina will be wooed.</p>

<p>Therefore this order hath Baptista ta’en,</p>

<p>That none shall have access unto Bianca</p>

<p>Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span>  “Katherine the curst,”</p>

<p>A title for a maid, of all titles the worst.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace</p>

<p>And offer me disguised in sober robes</p>

<p>To old Baptista as a schoolmaster</p>

<p>Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca,</p>

<p>That so I may, by this device at least,</p>

<p>Have leave and leisure to make love to her</p>

<p>And unsuspected court her by herself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span>  Here’s no knavery! See, to beguile the old</p>

<p>folks, how the young folks lay their heads together!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gremio and Lucentio, disguised as Cambio, a</p>

<p>schoolmaster.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Master, master, look about you. Who goes there, ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Peace, Grumio, it is the rival of my love.</p>

<p>Petruchio, stand by awhile.</p>

<p><center><i>[Petruchio, Hortensio, and Grumio stand aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>A proper stripling, and an amorous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span> <i>[to Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>O, very well, I have perused the note.</p>

<p>Hark you, sir, I’ll have them very fairly bound,</p>

<p>All books of love. See that at any hand,</p>

<p>And see you read no other lectures to her.</p>

<p>You understand me. Over and beside</p>

<p>Signior Baptista’s liberality,</p>

<p>I’ll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too.</p>

<p>And let me have them very well perfumed,</p>

<p>For she is sweeter than perfume itself</p>

<p>To whom they go to. What will you read to her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span> <i>[as Cambio]</i></p>

<p>Whate’er I read to her, I’ll plead for you</p>

<p>As for my patron, stand you so assured,</p>

<p>As firmly as yourself were still in place,</p>

<p>Yea, and perhaps with more successful words</p>

<p>Than you–unless you were a scholar, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>O this learning, what a thing it is!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>O this woodcock, what an ass it is!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Peace, sirrah.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Grumio, mum.     <i><i>[Coming forward.]</i></i></p>

<p>God save you, Signior Gremio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.</p>

<p>Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.</p>

<p>I promised to enquire carefully</p>

<p>About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca,</p>

<p>And by good fortune I have lighted well</p>

<p>On this young man, for learning and behavior</p>

<p>Fit for her turn, well read in poetry</p>

<p>And other books–good ones, I warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>’Tis well. And I have met a gentleman</p>

<p>Hath promised me to help me to another,</p>

<p>A fine musician to instruct our mistress.</p>

<p>So shall I no whit be behind in duty</p>

<p>To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span> <i>[aside]</i>  And that his bags shall prove.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love.</p>

<p>Listen to me, and if you speak me fair</p>

<p>I’ll tell you news indifferent good for either.</p>

<p><center><i>[Presenting Petruchio.]</i></center></p>

<p>Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,</p>

<p>Upon agreement from us to his liking,</p>

<p>Will undertake to woo curst Katherine,</p>

<p>Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span>  So said, so done, is well.</p>

<p>Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>I know she is an irksome, brawling scold.</p>

<p>If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>No? Sayst me so, friend? What countryman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Born in Verona, old Antonio’s son.</p>

<p>My father dead, my fortune lives for me,</p>

<p>And I do hope good days and long to see.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>Oh, sir, such a life with such a wife were strange.</p>

<p>But if you have a stomach, to ’t, i’ God’s name!</p>

<p>You shall have me assisting you in all.</p>

<p>But will you woo this wildcat?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  Will I live?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span></p>

<p>Will he woo her? Ay, or I’ll hang her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Why came I hither but to that intent?</p>

<p>Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?</p>

<p>Have I not in my time heard lions roar?</p>

<p>Have I not heard the sea, puffed up with winds,</p>

<p>Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?</p>

<p>Have I not heard great ordnance in the field</p>

<p>And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?</p>

<p>Have I not in a pitched battle heard</p>

<p>Loud ’larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets clang?</p>

<p>And do you tell me of a woman’s tongue,</p>

<p>That gives not half so great a blow to hear</p>

<p>As will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire?</p>

<p>Tush, tush, fear boys with bugs!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span>  For he fears none.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span>  Hortensio, hark.</p>

<p>This gentleman is happily arrived,</p>

<p>My mind presumes, for his own good and yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>I promised we would be contributors</p>

<p>And bear his charge of wooing whatsoe’er.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>And so we will, provided that he win her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span></p>

<p>I would I were as sure of a good dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Tranio, disguised as Lucentio, and Biondello.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,</p>

<p>Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way</p>

<p>To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span>  He that has the two fair daughters–is ’t</p>

<p>he you mean?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i>  Even he, Biondello.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>Hark you, sir, you mean not her to–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Perhaps him and her, sir. What have you to do?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let’s away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Well begun, Tranio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span>  Sir, a word ere you go.</p>

<p>Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>An if I be, sir, is it any offense?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>No, if without more words you will get you hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Why sir, I pray, are not the streets as free</p>

<p>For me, as for you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span>  But so is not she.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>For what reason, I beseech you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>For this reason, if you’ll know:</p>

<p>That she’s the choice love of Signior Gremio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>That she’s the chosen of Signior Hortensio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Softly, my masters. If you be gentlemen,</p>

<p>Do me this right: hear me with patience.</p>

<p>Baptista is a noble gentleman</p>

<p>To whom my father is not all unknown,</p>

<p>And were his daughter fairer than she is,</p>

<p>She may more suitors have, and me for one.</p>

<p>Fair Leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers.</p>

<p>Then well one more may fair Bianca have.</p>

<p>And so she shall. Lucentio shall make one,</p>

<p>Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span> <i>[as Cambio]</i></p>

<p>Sir, give him head; I know he’ll prove a jade.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Hortensio, to what end are all these words?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span> <i>[to Tranio]</i></p>

<p>Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,</p>

<p>Did you yet ever see Baptista’s daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,</p>

<p>The one as famous for a scolding tongue</p>

<p>As is the other for beauteous modesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Sir, sir, the first’s for me; let her go by.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gremio</span></p>

<p>Yea, leave that labor to great Hercules,</p>

<p>And let it be more than Alcides’ twelve.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span> <i>[to Tranio]</i></p>

<p>Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:</p>

<p>The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,</p>

<p>Her father keeps from all access of suitors</p>

<p>And will not promise her to any man</p>

<p>Until the elder sister first be wed.</p>

<p>The younger then is free, and not before.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>If it be so, sir, that you are the man</p>

<p>Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest,</p>

<p>And if you break the ice and do this feat,</p>

<p>Achieve the elder, set the younger free</p>

<p>For our access, whose hap shall be to have her</p>

<p>Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive.</p>

<p>And since you do profess to be a suitor,</p>

<p>You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,</p>

<p>To whom we all rest generally beholding.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,</p>

<p>Please you we may contrive this afternoon</p>

<p>And quaff carouses to our mistress’ health,</p>

<p>And do as adversaries do in law,</p>

<p>Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Grumio</span> and <span class='sc'>Biondello</span></p>

<p>O excellent motion! Fellows, let’s be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>The motion’s good indeed, and be it so.–</p>
