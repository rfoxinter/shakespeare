<p><center><i>[Enter aloft Christopher Sly, the drunkard, with</p>

<p>Attendants, some with apparel, basin and ewer, and</p>

<p>other appurtenances, and Lord dressed as an Attendant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  For God’s sake, a pot of small ale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>Will ’t please your Lord drink a cup of sack?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>Will ’t please your Honor taste of these conserves?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>What raiment will your Honor wear today?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  I am Christophero Sly! Call not me “Honor” nor</p>

<p>“Lordship.” I ne’er drank sack in my life. An if you</p>

<p>give me any conserves, give me conserves of beef.</p>

<p>Ne’er ask me what raiment I’ll wear, for I have no</p>

<p>more doublets than backs, no more stockings than</p>

<p>legs, nor no more shoes than feet, nay sometime</p>

<p>more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look</p>

<p>through the over-leather.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc> <i>[as Attendant]</i></p>

<p>Heaven cease this idle humor in your Honor!</p>

<p>O, that a mighty man of such descent,</p>

<p>Of such possessions, and so high esteem</p>

<p>Should be infused with so foul a spirit!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher</p>

<p>Sly, old Sly’s son of Burton Heath, by birth a</p>

<p>peddler, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation</p>

<p>a bearherd, and now by present profession a</p>

<p>tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat alewife of Wincot,</p>

<p>if she know me not! If she say I am not fourteen</p>

<p>pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the</p>

<p>lying’st knave in Christendom. What, I am not</p>

<p>bestraught! Here’s–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>O, this it is that makes your lady mourn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>O, this is it that makes your servants droop.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc> <i>[as Attendant]</i></p>

<p>Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,</p>

<p>As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.</p>

<p>O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,</p>

<p>Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,</p>

<p>And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.</p>

<p>Look how thy servants do attend on thee,</p>

<p>Each in his office ready at thy beck.</p>

<p>Wilt thou have music? Hark, Apollo plays,     <i><i>[Music.]</i></i></p>

<p>And twenty caged nightingales do sing.</p>

<p>Or wilt thou sleep? We’ll have thee to a couch</p>

<p>Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed</p>

<p>On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis.</p>

<p>Say thou wilt walk, we will bestrew the ground.</p>

<p>Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapped,</p>

<p>Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.</p>

<p>Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar</p>

<p>Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt?</p>

<p>Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them</p>

<p>And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>Say thou wilt course. Thy greyhounds are as swift</p>

<p>As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight</p>

<p>Adonis painted by a running brook,</p>

<p>And Cytherea all in sedges hid,</p>

<p>Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,</p>

<p>Even as the waving sedges play with wind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc> <i>[as Attendant]</i></p>

<p>We’ll show thee Io as she was a maid</p>

<p>And how she was beguiled and surprised,</p>

<p>As lively painted as the deed was done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,</p>

<p>Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,</p>

<p>And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,</p>

<p>So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc> <i>[as Attendant]</i></p>

<p>Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord;</p>

<p>Thou hast a lady far more beautiful</p>

<p>Than any woman in this waning age.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>And till the tears that she hath shed for thee</p>

<p>Like envious floods o’errun her lovely face,</p>

<p>She was the fairest creature in the world–</p>

<p>And yet she is inferior to none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc></p>

<p>Am I a lord, and have I such a lady?</p>

<p>Or do I dream? Or have I dreamed till now?</p>

<p>I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak,</p>

<p>I smell sweet savors, and I feel soft things.</p>

<p>Upon my life, I am a lord indeed</p>

<p>And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly.</p>

<p>Well, bring our lady hither to our sight,</p>

<p>And once again a pot o’ the smallest ale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>Will ’t please your Mightiness to wash your hands?</p>

<p>O, how we joy to see your wit restored!</p>

<p>O, that once more you knew but what you are!</p>

<p>These fifteen years you have been in a dream,</p>

<p>Or, when you waked, so waked as if you slept.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc></p>

<p>These fifteen years! By my fay, a goodly nap.</p>

<p>But did I never speak of all that time?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>Oh, yes, my lord, but very idle words.</p>

<p>For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,</p>

<p>Yet would you say you were beaten out of door,</p>

<p>And rail upon the hostess of the house,</p>

<p>And say you would present her at the leet</p>

<p>Because she brought stone jugs and no sealed</p>

<p>quarts.</p>

<p>Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  Ay, the woman’s maid of the house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>Why, sir, you know no house, nor no such maid,</p>

<p>Nor no such men as you have reckoned up,</p>

<p>As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greete,</p>

<p>And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell,</p>

<p>And twenty more such names and men as these,</p>

<p>Which never were, nor no man ever saw.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  Now, Lord be thanked for my good amends!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  I thank thee. Thou shalt not lose by it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Page as Lady, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc> <i>[as Lady]</i>  How fares my noble lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  Marry, I fare well, for here is cheer enough.</p>

<p>Where is my wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc> <i>[as Lady]</i></p>

<p>Here, noble lord. What is thy will with her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc></p>

<p>Are you my wife, and will not call me “husband”?</p>

<p>My men should call me “lord.” I am your goodman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc> <i>[as Lady]</i></p>

<p>My husband and my lord, my lord and husband,</p>

<p>I am your wife in all obedience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc></p>

<p>I know it well.–What must I call her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc> <i>[as Attendant]</i>  “Madam.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  “Alice Madam,” or “Joan Madam”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>“Madam,” and nothing else. So lords call ladies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc></p>

<p>Madam wife, they say that I have dreamed</p>

<p>And slept above some fifteen year or more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc> <i>[as Lady]</i></p>

<p>Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,</p>

<p>Being all this time abandoned from your bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc></p>

<p>’Tis much.–Servants, leave me and her alone.–</p>

<p>Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc> <i>[as Lady]</i></p>

<p>Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you</p>

<p>To pardon me yet for a night or two;</p>

<p>Or if not so, until the sun be set.</p>

<p>For your physicians have expressly charged,</p>

<p>In peril to incur your former malady,</p>

<p>That I should yet absent me from your bed.</p>

<p>I hope this reason stands for my excuse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long; but</p>

<p>I would be loath to fall into my dreams again. I will</p>

<p>therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the</p>

<p>blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Your Honor’s players, hearing your amendment,</p>

<p>Are come to play a pleasant comedy,</p>

<p>For so your doctors hold it very meet,</p>

<p>Seeing too much sadness hath congealed your</p>

<p>blood,</p>

<p>And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy.</p>

<p>Therefore they thought it good you hear a play</p>

<p>And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,</p>

<p>Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  Marry, I will. Let them play it.     <i><i>[Messenger exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Is not a comonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling</p>

<p>trick?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc> <i>[as Lady]</i></p>

<p>No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  What, household stuff?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Page</sc> <i>[as Lady]</i>  It is a kind of history.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sly</sc>  Well, we’ll see ’t. Come, madam wife, sit by my</p>

<p>side, and let the world slip. We shall ne’er be</p>

<p>younger.</p>
