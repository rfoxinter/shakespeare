<p><center><i>[Enter Baptista, Gremio, Tranio as Lucentio, Katherine,</p>

<p>Bianca, Lucentio as Cambio, and others, Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc> <i>[to Tranio]</i></p>

<p>Signior Lucentio, this is the ’pointed day</p>

<p>That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,</p>

<p>And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.</p>

<p>What will be said? What mockery will it be,</p>

<p>To want the bridegroom when the priest attends</p>

<p>To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage?</p>

<p>What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>No shame but mine. I must, forsooth, be forced</p>

<p>To give my hand, opposed against my heart,</p>

<p>Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen,</p>

<p>Who wooed in haste and means to wed at leisure.</p>

<p>I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,</p>

<p>Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior,</p>

<p>And, to be noted for a merry man,</p>

<p>He’ll woo a thousand, ’point the day of marriage,</p>

<p>Make friends, invite, and proclaim the banns,</p>

<p>Yet never means to wed where he hath wooed.</p>

<p>Now must the world point at poor Katherine</p>

<p>And say “Lo, there is mad Petruchio’s wife,</p>

<p>If it would please him come and marry her.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.</p>

<p>Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,</p>

<p>Whatever fortune stays him from his word.</p>

<p>Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;</p>

<p>Though he be merry, yet withal he’s honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Would Katherine had never seen him, though!</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits weeping.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc></p>

<p>Go, girl. I cannot blame thee now to weep,</p>

<p>For such an injury would vex a very saint,</p>

<p>Much more a shrew of thy impatient humor.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Biondello.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc>  Master, master, news! And such old</p>

<p>news as you never heard of!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc></p>

<p>Is it new and old too? How may that be?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc>  Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio’s</p>

<p>coming?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc>  Is he come?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc>  Why, no, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc></p>

<p>What then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc>  He is coming.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc>  When will he be here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc></p>

<p>When he stands where I am, and sees you there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i>  But say, what to thine old news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc>  Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and</p>

<p>an old jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned,</p>

<p>a pair of boots that have been candle-cases, one</p>

<p>buckled, another laced; an old rusty sword ta’en</p>

<p>out of the town armory, with a broken hilt, and</p>

<p>chapeless; with two broken points; his horse</p>

<p>hipped, with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no</p>

<p>kindred, besides possessed with the glanders and</p>

<p>like to mose in the chine, troubled with the lampass,</p>

<p>infected with the fashions, full of windgalls,</p>

<p>sped with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure</p>

<p>of the fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn</p>

<p>with the bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten,</p>

<p>near-legged before, and with a half-checked</p>

<p>bit and a headstall of sheep’s leather,</p>

<p>which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling,</p>

<p>hath been often burst, and now repaired with</p>

<p>knots; one girth six times pieced, and a woman’s</p>

<p>crupper of velour, which hath two letters for her</p>

<p>name fairly set down in studs, and here and there</p>

<p>pieced with packthread.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc>  Who comes with him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc>  Oh, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned</p>

<p>like the horse: with a linen stock on one leg</p>

<p>and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with</p>

<p>a red and blue list; an old hat, and the humor of</p>

<p>forty fancies pricked in ’t for a feather. A monster,</p>

<p>a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian</p>

<p>footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>’Tis some odd humor pricks him to this fashion,</p>

<p>Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-appareled.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc></p>

<p>I am glad he’s come, howsoe’er he comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc>  Why, sir, he comes not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc>  Didst thou not say he comes?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc>  Who? That Petruchio came?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc>  Ay, that Petruchio came!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc>  No, sir, I say his horse comes with him on</p>

<p>his back.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc>  Why, that’s all one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Nay, by Saint Jamy.</i></p>

<p>     <i>I hold you a penny,</i></p>

<p>     <i>A horse and a man</i></p>

<p>     <i>Is more than one,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And yet not many.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Petruchio and Grumio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Come, where be these gallants? Who’s at home?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc>  You are welcome, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc>  And yet I come not well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc>  And yet you halt not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i>  Not so well appareled as I wish</p>

<p>you were.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Were it better I should rush in thus–</p>

<p>But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?</p>

<p>How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown.</p>

<p>And wherefore gaze this goodly company</p>

<p>As if they saw some wondrous monument,</p>

<p>Some comet or unusual prodigy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc></p>

<p>Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day.</p>

<p>First were we sad, fearing you would not come,</p>

<p>Now sadder that you come so unprovided.</p>

<p>Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,</p>

<p>An eyesore to our solemn festival.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>And tell us what occasion of import</p>

<p>Hath all so long detained you from your wife</p>

<p>And sent you hither so unlike yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear.</p>

<p>Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,</p>

<p>Though in some part enforced to digress,</p>

<p>Which at more leisure I will so excuse</p>

<p>As you shall well be satisfied with all.</p>

<p>But where is Kate? I stay too long from her.</p>

<p>The morning wears. ’Tis time we were at church.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>See not your bride in these unreverent robes.</p>

<p>Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Not I, believe me. Thus I’ll visit her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc></p>

<p>But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Good sooth, even thus. Therefore, ha’ done with</p>

<p>words.</p>

<p>To me she’s married, not unto my clothes.</p>

<p>Could I repair what she will wear in me,</p>

<p>As I can change these poor accoutrements,</p>

<p>’Twere well for Kate and better for myself.</p>

<p>But what a fool am I to chat with you</p>

<p>When I should bid good morrow to my bride</p>

<p>And seal the title with a lovely kiss!</p>

<p><center><i>[Petruchio exits, with Grumio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>He hath some meaning in his mad attire.</p>

<p>We will persuade him, be it possible,</p>

<p>To put on better ere he go to church.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc></p>

<p>I’ll after him, and see the event of this.</p>

<p><center><i>[All except Tranio and Lucentio exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc></p>

<p>But, sir, to love concerneth us to add</p>

<p>Her father’s liking, which to bring to pass,</p>

<p>As I before imparted to your Worship,</p>

<p>I am to get a man (whate’er he be</p>

<p>It skills not much, we’ll fit him to our turn),</p>

<p>And he shall be “Vincentio of Pisa,”</p>

<p>And make assurance here in Padua</p>

<p>Of greater sums than I have promised.</p>

<p>So shall you quietly enjoy your hope</p>

<p>And marry sweet Bianca with consent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster</p>

<p>Doth watch Bianca’s steps so narrowly,</p>

<p>’Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage,</p>

<p>Which, once performed, let all the world say no,</p>

<p>I’ll keep mine own despite of all the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc></p>

<p>That by degrees we mean to look into,</p>

<p>And watch our vantage in this business.</p>

<p>We’ll overreach the graybeard, Gremio,</p>

<p>The narrow prying father, Minola,</p>

<p>The quaint musician, amorous Litio,</p>

<p>All for my master’s sake, Lucentio.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gremio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Signior Gremio, came you from the church?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc></p>

<p>As willingly as e’er I came from school.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc></p>

<p>A bridegroom, say you? ’Tis a groom indeed,</p>

<p>A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Curster than she? Why, ’tis impossible.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc></p>

<p>Why, he’s a devil, a devil, a very fiend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Why, she’s a devil, a devil, the devil’s dam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc></p>

<p>Tut, she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool to him.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest</p>

<p>Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,</p>

<p>“Ay, by gog’s wouns!” quoth he, and swore so loud</p>

<p>That, all amazed, the priest let fall the book,</p>

<p>And as he stooped again to take it up,</p>

<p>This mad-brained bridegroom took him such a cuff</p>

<p>That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.</p>

<p>“Now, take them up,” quoth he, “if any list.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>What said the wench when he rose again?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc></p>

<p>Trembled and shook, for why he stamped and swore</p>

<p>As if the vicar meant to cozen him.</p>

<p>But after many ceremonies done,</p>

<p>He calls for wine. “A health!” quoth he, as if</p>

<p>He had been aboard, carousing to his mates</p>

<p>After a storm; quaffed off the muscatel</p>

<p>And threw the sops all in the sexton’s face,</p>

<p>Having no other reason</p>

<p>But that his beard grew thin and hungerly,</p>

<p>And seemed to ask him sops as he was drinking.</p>

<p>This done, he took the bride about the neck</p>

<p>And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack</p>

<p>That at the parting all the church did echo.</p>

<p>And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame,</p>

<p>And after me I know the rout is coming.</p>

<p>Such a mad marriage never was before!     <i><i>[Music plays.]</i></i></p>

<p>Hark, hark, I hear the minstrels play.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Petruchio, Katherine, Bianca, Hortensio, Baptista,</p>

<p>Grumio, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.</p>

<p>I know you think to dine with me today</p>

<p>And have prepared great store of wedding cheer,</p>

<p>But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,</p>

<p>And therefore here I mean to take my leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc></p>

<p>Is ’t possible you will away tonight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>I must away today, before night come.</p>

<p>Make it no wonder. If you knew my business,</p>

<p>You would entreat me rather go than stay.</p>

<p>And, honest company, I thank you all,</p>

<p>That have beheld me give away myself</p>

<p>To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.</p>

<p>Dine with my father, drink a health to me,</p>

<p>For I must hence, and farewell to you all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc>  It may not be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc>  Let me entreat you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc>  It cannot be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Let me entreat you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>I am content.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Are you content to stay?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>I am content you shall entreat me stay,</p>

<p>But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Now, if you love me, stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc>  Grumio, my horse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Grumio</sc>  Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the</p>

<p>horses.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Nay, then,</p>

<p>Do what thou canst, I will not go today,</p>

<p>No, nor tomorrow, not till I please myself.</p>

<p>The door is open, sir. There lies your way.</p>

<p>You may be jogging whiles your boots are green.</p>

<p>For me, I’ll not be gone till I please myself.</p>

<p>’Tis like you’ll prove a jolly surly groom,</p>

<p>That take it on you at the first so roundly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>O Kate, content thee. Prithee, be not angry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>I will be angry. What hast thou to do?–</p>

<p>Father, be quiet. He shall stay my leisure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc></p>

<p>Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.</p>

<p>I see a woman may be made a fool</p>

<p>If she had not a spirit to resist.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Petruchio</sc></p>

<p>They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.–</p>

<p>Obey the bride, you that attend on her.</p>

<p>Go to the feast, revel and domineer,</p>

<p>Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,</p>

<p>Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.</p>

<p>But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.</p>

<p>Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;</p>

<p>I will be master of what is mine own.</p>

<p>She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,</p>

<p>My household stuff, my field, my barn,</p>

<p>My horse, my ox, my ass, my anything.</p>

<p>And here she stands, touch her whoever dare.</p>

<p>I’ll bring mine action on the proudest he</p>

<p>That stops my way in Padua.–Grumio,</p>

<p>Draw forth thy weapon. We are beset with thieves.</p>

<p>Rescue thy mistress if thou be a man!–</p>

<p>Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch thee,</p>

<p>Kate.</p>

<p>I’ll buckler thee against a million.</p>

<p>Nay, let them go. A couple of quiet ones!</p>

<p><sc>Bianca</sc></p>
