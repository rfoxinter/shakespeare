<p><center><i>[Enter Tranio as Lucentio, and the Merchant, booted,</p>

<p>and dressed like Vincentio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Sir, this is the house. Please it you that I call?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>Ay, what else? And but I be deceived,</p>

<p>Signior Baptista may remember me,</p>

<p>Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,</p>

<p>Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>’Tis well. And hold your own in any case</p>

<p>With such austerity as ’longeth to a father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>I warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Biondello.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But, sir, here comes your boy.</p>

<p>’Twere good he were schooled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Fear you not him.–Sirrah Biondello,</p>

<p>Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.</p>

<p>Imagine ’twere the right Vincentio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span>  Tut, fear not me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span></p>

<p>I told him that your father was at Venice,</p>

<p>And that you looked for him this day in Padua.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Thou ’rt a tall fellow. Hold thee that to drink.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives him money.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Baptista and Lucentio as Cambio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[Merchant stands bareheaded.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Signior Baptista, you are happily met.–</p>

<p>Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of.</p>

<p>I pray you stand good father to me now.</p>

<p>Give me Bianca for my patrimony.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Merchant</span> <i>[as Vincentio]</i>  Soft, son.–</p>

<p>Sir, by your leave, having come to Padua</p>

<p>To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio</p>

<p>Made me acquainted with a weighty cause</p>

<p>Of love between your daughter and himself.</p>

<p>And, for the good report I hear of you,</p>

<p>And for the love he beareth to your daughter</p>

<p>And she to him, to stay him not too long,</p>

<p>I am content, in a good father’s care,</p>

<p>To have him matched. And if you please to like</p>

<p>No worse than I, upon some agreement</p>

<p>Me shall you find ready and willing</p>

<p>With one consent to have her so bestowed,</p>

<p>For curious I cannot be with you,</p>

<p>Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.</p>

<p>Your plainness and your shortness please me well.</p>

<p>Right true it is your son Lucentio here</p>

<p>Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,</p>

<p>Or both dissemble deeply their affections.</p>

<p>And therefore, if you say no more than this,</p>

<p>That like a father you will deal with him</p>

<p>And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,</p>

<p>The match is made, and all is done.</p>

<p>Your son shall have my daughter with consent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best</p>

<p>We be affied and such assurance ta’en</p>

<p>As shall with either part’s agreement stand?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know</p>

<p>Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants.</p>

<p>Besides, old Gremio is heark’ning still,</p>

<p>And happily we might be interrupted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Then at my lodging, an it like you.</p>

<p>There doth my father lie, and there this night</p>

<p>We’ll pass the business privately and well.</p>

<p>Send for your daughter by your servant here.</p>

<p><center><i>[He indicates Lucentio, and winks at him.]</i></center></p>

<p>My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.</p>

<p>The worst is this: that at so slender warning</p>

<p>You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span></p>

<p>It likes me well.–Cambio, hie you home,</p>

<p>And bid Bianca make her ready straight.</p>

<p>And, if you will, tell what hath happened:</p>

<p>Lucentio’s father is arrived in Padua,</p>

<p>And how she’s like to be Lucentio’s wife.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lucentio exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span></p>

<p>I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.–</p>

<p>Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?</p>

<p>Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer.</p>

<p>Come, sir, we will better it in Pisa.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Baptista</span>  I follow you.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Biondello exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucentio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span>  Cambio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span>  What sayst thou, Biondello?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span>  You saw my master wink and laugh upon</p>

<p>you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span>  Biondello, what of that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span>  Faith, nothing; but ’has left me here behind</p>

<p>to expound the meaning or moral of his signs</p>

<p>and tokens.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span>  I pray thee, moralize them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span>  Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with</p>

<p>the deceiving father of a deceitful son.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span>  And what of him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span>  His daughter is to be brought by you to the</p>

<p>supper.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span>  And then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span>  The old priest at Saint Luke’s Church is at</p>

<p>your command at all hours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span>  And what of all this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span>  I cannot tell, except they are busied</p>

<p>about a counterfeit assurance. Take you assurance</p>

<p>of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum. To th’</p>

<p>church take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient</p>

<p>honest witnesses.</p>

<p>If this be not that you look for, I have no more to</p>

<p>say,</p>

<p>But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span>  Hear’st thou, Biondello?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span>  I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in</p>

<p>an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley</p>

<p>to stuff a rabbit, and so may you, sir. And so adieu,</p>

<p>sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint</p>

<p>Luke’s to bid the priest be ready to come against</p>

<p>you come with your appendix.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span></p>

<p>I may, and will, if she be so contented.</p>

<p>She will be pleased. Then wherefore should I</p>

<p>doubt?</p>

<p>Hap what hap may, I’ll roundly go about her.</p>

<p>It shall go hard if “Cambio” go without her.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
