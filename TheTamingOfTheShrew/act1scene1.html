<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter Lucentio and his man Tranio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>Tranio, since for the great desire I had</p>

<p>To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,</p>

<p>I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,</p>

<p>The pleasant garden of great Italy,</p>

<p>And by my father’s love and leave am armed</p>

<p>With his goodwill and thy good company.</p>

<p>My trusty servant well approved in all,</p>

<p>Here let us breathe and haply institute</p>

<p>A course of learning and ingenious studies.</p>

<p>Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,</p>

<p>Gave me my being, and my father first,</p>

<p>A merchant of great traffic through the world,</p>

<p>Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii.</p>

<p>Vincentio’s son, brought up in Florence,</p>

<p>It shall become to serve all hopes conceived</p>

<p>To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.</p>

<p>And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study</p>

<p>Virtue, and that part of philosophy</p>

<p>Will I apply that treats of happiness</p>

<p>By virtue specially to be achieved.</p>

<p>Tell me thy mind, for I have Pisa left</p>

<p>And am to Padua come, as he that leaves</p>

<p>A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep</p>

<p>And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc></p>

<p>Mi perdonato, gentle master mine.</p>

<p>I am in all affected as yourself,</p>

<p>Glad that you thus continue your resolve</p>

<p>To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.</p>

<p>Only, good master, while we do admire</p>

<p>This virtue and this moral discipline,</p>

<p>Let’s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray,</p>

<p>Or so devote to Aristotle’s checks</p>

<p>As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured.</p>

<p>Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,</p>

<p>And practice rhetoric in your common talk;</p>

<p>Music and poesy use to quicken you;</p>

<p>The mathematics and the metaphysics–</p>

<p>Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.</p>

<p>No profit grows where is no pleasure ta’en.</p>

<p>In brief, sir, study what you most affect.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.</p>

<p>If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,</p>

<p>We could at once put us in readiness</p>

<p>And take a lodging fit to entertain</p>

<p>Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Baptista with his two daughters, Katherine and</p>

<p>Bianca; Gremio, a pantaloon, and Hortensio, suitors</p>

<p>to Bianca.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But stay awhile! What company is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc></p>

<p>Master, some show to welcome us to town.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lucentio and Tranio stand by.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc> <i>[to Gremio and Hortensio]</i></p>

<p>Gentlemen, importune me no farther,</p>

<p>For how I firmly am resolved you know:</p>

<p>That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter</p>

<p>Before I have a husband for the elder.</p>

<p>If either of you both love Katherine,</p>

<p>Because I know you well and love you well,</p>

<p>Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc></p>

<p>To cart her, rather. She’s too rough for me.–</p>

<p>There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc> <i>[to Baptista]</i></p>

<p>I pray you, sir, is it your will</p>

<p>To make a stale of me amongst these mates?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc></p>

<p>“Mates,” maid? How mean you that? No mates for</p>

<p>you,</p>

<p>Unless you were of gentler, milder mold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>I’ faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.</p>

<p>Iwis it is not halfway to her heart.</p>

<p>But if it were, doubt not her care should be</p>

<p>To comb your noddle with a three-legged stool</p>

<p>And paint your face and use you like a fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc></p>

<p>From all such devils, good Lord, deliver us!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc>  And me too, good Lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[aside to Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Husht, master, here’s some good pastime toward;</p>

<p>That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc> <i>[aside to Tranio]</i></p>

<p>But in the other’s silence do I see</p>

<p>Maid’s mild behavior and sobriety.</p>

<p>Peace, Tranio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[aside to Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Well said, master. Mum, and gaze your fill.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc> <i>[to Gremio and Hortensio]</i></p>

<p>Gentlemen, that I may soon make good</p>

<p>What I have said–Bianca, get you in,</p>

<p>And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,</p>

<p>For I will love thee ne’er the less, my girl.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>A pretty peat! It is best</p>

<p>Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bianca</sc></p>

<p>Sister, content you in my discontent.–</p>

<p>Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe.</p>

<p>My books and instruments shall be my company,</p>

<p>On them to look and practice by myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc> <i>[aside to Tranio]</i></p>

<p>Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc></p>

<p>Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?</p>

<p>Sorry am I that our goodwill effects</p>

<p>Bianca’s grief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc>  Why will you mew her up,</p>

<p>Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,</p>

<p>And make her bear the penance of her tongue?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Baptista</sc></p>

<p>Gentlemen, content you. I am resolved.–</p>

<p>Go in, Bianca.     <i><i>[Bianca exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>And for I know she taketh most delight</p>

<p>In music, instruments, and poetry,</p>

<p>Schoolmasters will I keep within my house</p>

<p>Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,</p>

<p>Or, Signior Gremio, you know any such,</p>

<p>Prefer them hither. For to cunning men</p>

<p>I will be very kind, and liberal</p>

<p>To mine own children in good bringing up.</p>

<p>And so, farewell.–Katherine, you may stay,</p>

<p>For I have more to commune with Bianca.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?</p>

<p>What, shall I be appointed hours as though, belike,</p>

<p>I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha!</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc>  You may go to the Devil’s dam! Your gifts are</p>

<p>so good here’s none will hold you.–Their love is</p>

<p>not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails</p>

<p>together and fast it fairly out. Our cake’s dough on</p>

<p>both sides. Farewell. Yet for the love I bear my</p>

<p>sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit</p>

<p>man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will</p>

<p>wish him to her father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc>  So will I, Signior Gremio. But a word, I</p>

<p>pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never</p>

<p>brooked parle, know now upon advice, it toucheth</p>

<p>us both (that we may yet again have access to our</p>

<p>fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca’s love) to</p>

<p>labor and effect one thing specially.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc>  What’s that, I pray?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc>  Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc>  A husband? A devil!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc>  I say “a husband.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc>  I say “a devil.” Think’st thou, Hortensio,</p>

<p>though her father be very rich, any man is so very a</p>

<p>fool to be married to hell?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc>  Tush, Gremio. Though it pass your patience</p>

<p>and mine to endure her loud alarums, why,</p>

<p>man, there be good fellows in the world, an a man</p>

<p>could light on them, would take her with all faults,</p>

<p>and money enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc>  I cannot tell. But I had as lief take her dowry</p>

<p>with this condition: to be whipped at the high cross</p>

<p>every morning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hortensio</sc>  Faith, as you say, there’s small choice in</p>

<p>rotten apples. But come, since this bar in law</p>

<p>makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly</p>

<p>maintained till by helping Baptista’s eldest daughter</p>

<p>to a husband we set his youngest free for a</p>

<p>husband, and then have to ’t afresh. Sweet Bianca!</p>

<p>Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the</p>

<p>ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gremio</sc>  I am agreed, and would I had given him the</p>

<p>best horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would</p>

<p>thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid</p>

<p>the house of her. Come on.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gremio and Hortensio exit.</p>

<p>Tranio and Lucentio remain onstage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc></p>

<p>I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible</p>

<p>That love should of a sudden take such hold?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>O Tranio, till I found it to be true,</p>

<p>I never thought it possible or likely.</p>

<p>But see, while idly I stood looking on,</p>

<p>I found the effect of love-in-idleness,</p>

<p>And now in plainness do confess to thee</p>

<p>That art to me as secret and as dear</p>

<p>As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was:</p>

<p>Tranio, I burn, I pine! I perish, Tranio,</p>

<p>If I achieve not this young modest girl.</p>

<p>Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst.</p>

<p>Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc></p>

<p>Master, it is no time to chide you now.</p>

<p>Affection is not rated from the heart.</p>

<p>If love have touched you, naught remains but so:</p>

<p>Redime te captum quam queas minimo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>Gramercies, lad. Go forward. This contents;</p>

<p>The rest will comfort, for thy counsel’s sound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc></p>

<p>Master, you looked so longly on the maid,</p>

<p>Perhaps you marked not what’s the pith of all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,</p>

<p>Such as the daughter of Agenor had,</p>

<p>That made great Jove to humble him to her hand</p>

<p>When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc></p>

<p>Saw you no more? Marked you not how her sister</p>

<p>Began to scold and raise up such a storm</p>

<p>That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,</p>

<p>And with her breath she did perfume the air.</p>

<p>Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Nay, then ’tis time to stir him from his trance.–</p>

<p>I pray, awake, sir! If you love the maid,</p>

<p>Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it</p>

<p>stands:</p>

<p>Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd</p>

<p>That till the father rid his hands of her,</p>

<p>Master, your love must live a maid at home,</p>

<p>And therefore has he closely mewed her up,</p>

<p>Because she will not be annoyed with suitors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he!</p>

<p>But art thou not advised he took some care</p>

<p>To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc></p>

<p>Ay, marry, am I, sir–and now ’tis plotted!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>I have it, Tranio!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc>  Master, for my hand,</p>

<p>Both our inventions meet and jump in one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>Tell me thine first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc>  You will be schoolmaster</p>

<p>And undertake the teaching of the maid:</p>

<p>That’s your device.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc>  It is. May it be done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc></p>

<p>Not possible. For who shall bear your part</p>

<p>And be in Padua here Vincentio’s son,</p>

<p>Keep house, and ply his book, welcome his friends,</p>

<p>Visit his countrymen and banquet them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>Basta, content thee, for I have it full.</p>

<p>We have not yet been seen in any house,</p>

<p>Nor can we be distinguished by our faces</p>

<p>For man or master. Then it follows thus:</p>

<p>Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,</p>

<p>Keep house, and port, and servants, as I should.</p>

<p>I will some other be, some Florentine,</p>

<p>Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.</p>

<p>’Tis hatched, and shall be so. Tranio, at once</p>

<p>Uncase thee. Take my colored hat and cloak.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exchange clothes.]</i></center></p>

<p>When Biondello comes, he waits on thee,</p>

<p>But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc>  So had you need.</p>

<p>In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,</p>

<p>And I am tied to be obedient</p>

<p>(For so your father charged me at our parting:</p>

<p>“Be serviceable to my son,” quoth he,</p>

<p>Although I think ’twas in another sense),</p>

<p>I am content to be Lucentio,</p>

<p>Because so well I love Lucentio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves,</p>

<p>And let me be a slave, t’ achieve that maid</p>

<p>Whose sudden sight hath thralled my wounded eye.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Biondello.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes the rogue.–Sirrah, where have you</p>

<p>been?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc></p>

<p>Where have I been? Nay, how now, where are you?</p>

<p>Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes?</p>

<p>Or you stolen his? Or both? Pray, what’s the news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>Sirrah, come hither. ’Tis no time to jest,</p>

<p>And therefore frame your manners to the time.</p>

<p>Your fellow, Tranio here, to save my life,</p>

<p>Puts my apparel and my count’nance on,</p>

<p>And I for my escape have put on his;</p>

<p>For in a quarrel since I came ashore</p>

<p>I killed a man and fear I was descried.</p>

<p>Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,</p>

<p>While I make way from hence to save my life.</p>

<p>You understand me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc>  Ay, sir. <i>[Aside.]</i> Ne’er a whit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc></p>

<p>And not a jot of “Tranio” in your mouth.</p>

<p>Tranio is changed into Lucentio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Biondello</sc></p>

<p>The better for him. Would I were so too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tranio</sc></p>

<p>So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,</p>

<p>That Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest</p>

<p>daughter.</p>

<p>But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master’s, I</p>

<p>advise</p>

<p>You use your manners discreetly in all kind of</p>

<p>companies.</p>

<p>When I am alone, why then I am Tranio;</p>

<p>But in all places else, your master Lucentio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucentio</sc>  Tranio, let’s go. One thing more rests, that</p>

<p>thyself execute, to make one among these wooers. If</p>

<p>thou ask me why, sufficeth my reasons are both</p>

<p>good and weighty.     <i><i>[They exit.]</i></i></p>
