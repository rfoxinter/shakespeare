<p><center><i>[Enter Tranio as Lucentio and Hortensio as Litio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Is ’t possible, friend Litio, that mistress Bianca</p>

<p>Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?</p>

<p>I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span> <i>[as Litio]</i></p>

<p>Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,</p>

<p>Stand by, and mark the manner of his teaching.</p>

<p><center><i>[They stand aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bianca and Lucentio as Cambio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span> <i>[as Cambio]</i></p>

<p>Now mistress, profit you in what you read?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>What, master, read you? First resolve me that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span> <i>[as Cambio]</i></p>

<p>I read that I profess, The Art to Love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>And may you prove, sir, master of your art.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span> <i>[as Cambio]</i></p>

<p>While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.</p>

<p><center><i>[They move aside and kiss and talk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span> <i>[as Litio]</i></p>

<p>Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,</p>

<p>You that durst swear that your mistress Bianca</p>

<p>Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>O despiteful love, unconstant womankind!</p>

<p>I tell thee, Litio, this is wonderful!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Mistake no more. I am not Litio,</p>

<p>Nor a musician as I seem to be,</p>

<p>But one that scorn to live in this disguise</p>

<p>For such a one as leaves a gentleman</p>

<p>And makes a god of such a cullion.</p>

<p>Know, sir, that I am called Hortensio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Signior Hortensio, I have often heard</p>

<p>Of your entire affection to Bianca,</p>

<p>And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,</p>

<p>I will with you, if you be so contented,</p>

<p>Forswear Bianca and her love forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>See how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,</p>

<p>Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow</p>

<p>Never to woo her more, but do forswear her</p>

<p>As one unworthy all the former favors</p>

<p>That I have fondly flattered her withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>And here I take the like unfeigned oath,</p>

<p>Never to marry with her, though she would entreat.</p>

<p>Fie on her, see how beastly she doth court him!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!</p>

<p>For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,</p>

<p>I will be married to a wealthy widow</p>

<p>Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me</p>

<p>As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.</p>

<p>And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.</p>

<p>Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,</p>

<p>Shall win my love, and so I take my leave,</p>

<p>In resolution as I swore before.</p>

<p><center><i>[Hortensio exits;]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Bianca and Lucentio come forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span></p>

<p>Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace</p>

<p>As ’longeth to a lover’s blessed case!</p>

<p>Nay, I have ta’en you napping, gentle love,</p>

<p>And have forsworn you with Hortensio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>Tranio, you jest. But have you both forsworn me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span></p>

<p>Mistress, we have.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span>  Then we are rid of Litio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span></p>

<p>I’ faith, he’ll have a lusty widow now</p>

<p>That shall be wooed and wedded in a day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span>  God give him joy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span></p>

<p>Ay, and he’ll tame her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span>  He says so, Tranio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span></p>

<p>Faith, he is gone unto the taming school.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>The taming school? What, is there such a place?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span></p>

<p>Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master,</p>

<p>That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long</p>

<p>To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Biondello.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span></p>

<p>O master, master, I have watched so long</p>

<p>That I am dog-weary, but at last I spied</p>

<p>An ancient angel coming down the hill</p>

<p>Will serve the turn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span>  What is he, Biondello?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span></p>

<p>Master, a marcantant, or a pedant,</p>

<p>I know not what, but formal in apparel,</p>

<p>In gait and countenance surely like a father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucentio</span>  And what of him, Tranio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span></p>

<p>If he be credulous, and trust my tale,</p>

<p>I’ll make him glad to seem Vincentio</p>

<p>And give assurance to Baptista Minola</p>

<p>As if he were the right Vincentio.</p>

<p>Take in your love, and then let me alone.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lucentio and Bianca exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Merchant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>God save you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i>  And you, sir. You are welcome.</p>

<p>Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>Sir, at the farthest for a week or two,</p>

<p>But then up farther, and as far as Rome,</p>

<p>And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>What countryman, I pray?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Merchant</span>  Of Mantua.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid!</p>

<p>And come to Padua, careless of your life?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>My life, sir? How, I pray? For that goes hard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>’Tis death for anyone in Mantua</p>

<p>To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?</p>

<p>Your ships are stayed at Venice, and the Duke,</p>

<p>For private quarrel ’twixt your duke and him,</p>

<p>Hath published and proclaimed it openly.</p>

<p>’Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come,</p>

<p>You might have heard it else proclaimed about.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so,</p>

<p>For I have bills for money by exchange</p>

<p>From Florence, and must here deliver them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Well, sir, to do you courtesy,</p>

<p>This will I do, and this I will advise you.</p>

<p>First tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,</p>

<p>Pisa renowned for grave citizens.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Among them know you one Vincentio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>I know him not, but I have heard of him:</p>

<p>A merchant of incomparable wealth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>He is my father, sir, and sooth to say,</p>

<p>In count’nance somewhat doth resemble you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Biondello</span> <i>[aside]</i>  As much as an apple doth an</p>

<p>oyster, and all one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>To save your life in this extremity,</p>

<p>This favor will I do you for his sake</p>

<p>(And think it not the worst of all your fortunes</p>

<p>That you are like to Sir Vincentio):</p>

<p>His name and credit shall you undertake,</p>

<p>And in my house you shall be friendly lodged.</p>

<p>Look that you take upon you as you should.</p>

<p>You understand me, sir. So shall you stay</p>

<p>Till you have done your business in the city.</p>

<p>If this be court’sy, sir, accept of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>O sir, I do, and will repute you ever</p>

<p>The patron of my life and liberty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tranio</span> <i>[as Lucentio]</i></p>

<p>Then go with me, to make the matter good.</p>

<p>This, by the way, I let you understand:</p>

<p>My father is here looked for every day</p>

<p>To pass assurance of a dower in marriage</p>

<p>’Twixt me and one Baptista’s daughter here.</p>

<p>In all these circumstances I’ll instruct you.</p>

<p>Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.</p>
