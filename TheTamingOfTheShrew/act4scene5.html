<p><center><i>[Enter Petruchio, Katherine, Hortensio, and Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Come on, i’ God’s name, once more toward our</p>

<p>father’s.</p>

<p>Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>I say it is the moon that shines so bright.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>I know it is the sun that shines so bright.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Now, by my mother’s son, and that’s myself,</p>

<p>It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,</p>

<p>Or e’er I journey to your father’s house.</p>

<p><i>[To Servants.]</i> Go on, and fetch our horses back</p>

<p>again.–</p>

<p>Evermore crossed and crossed, nothing but crossed!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span> <i>[to Katherine]</i></p>

<p>Say as he says, or we shall never go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,</p>

<p>And be it moon, or sun, or what you please.</p>

<p>And if you please to call it a rush candle,</p>

<p>Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span>  I say it is the moon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  I know it is the moon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Nay, then you lie. It is the blessed sun.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Then God be blest, it is the blessed sun.</p>

<p>But sun it is not, when you say it is not,</p>

<p>And the moon changes even as your mind.</p>

<p>What you will have it named, even that it is,</p>

<p>And so it shall be so for Katherine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Well, forward, forward. Thus the bowl should run,</p>

<p>And not unluckily against the bias.</p>

<p>But soft! Company is coming here.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Vincentio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><i>[To Vincentio.]</i> Good morrow, gentle mistress, where</p>

<p>away?–</p>

<p>Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly, too,</p>

<p>Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?</p>

<p>Such war of white and red within her cheeks!</p>

<p>What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty</p>

<p>As those two eyes become that heavenly face?–</p>

<p>Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.–</p>

<p>Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty’s sake.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>He will make the man mad, to make the woman of</p>

<p>him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,</p>

<p>Whither away, or where is thy abode?</p>

<p>Happy the parents of so fair a child!</p>

<p>Happier the man whom favorable stars</p>

<p>Allots thee for his lovely bedfellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Why, how now, Kate? I hope thou art not mad!</p>

<p>This is a man–old, wrinkled, faded, withered–</p>

<p>And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes</p>

<p>That have been so bedazzled with the sun</p>

<p>That everything I look on seemeth green.</p>

<p>Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.</p>

<p>Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known</p>

<p>Which way thou travelest. If along with us,</p>

<p>We shall be joyful of thy company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vincentio</span></p>

<p>Fair sir, and you, my merry mistress,</p>

<p>That with your strange encounter much amazed me,</p>

<p>My name is called Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,</p>

<p>And bound I am to Padua, there to visit</p>

<p>A son of mine which long I have not seen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>What is his name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vincentio</span>  Lucentio, gentle sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Happily met, the happier for thy son.</p>

<p>And now by law as well as reverend age,</p>

<p>I may entitle thee my loving father.</p>

<p>The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,</p>

<p>Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,</p>

<p>Nor be not grieved. She is of good esteem,</p>

<p>Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;</p>

<p>Beside, so qualified as may beseem</p>

<p>The spouse of any noble gentleman.</p>

<p>Let me embrace with old Vincentio,</p>

<p>And wander we to see thy honest son,</p>

<p>Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vincentio</span></p>

<p>But is this true, or is it else your pleasure,</p>

<p>Like pleasant travelers, to break a jest</p>

<p>Upon the company you overtake?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>I do assure thee, father, so it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Petruchio</span></p>

<p>Come, go along and see the truth hereof,</p>

<p>For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Hortensio exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hortensio</span></p>

<p>Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart!</p>

<p>Have to my widow, and if she be froward,</p>

<p>Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
