<p><center><i>[Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet served</p>

<p>in, and then enter Lord Timon, the States, the Athenian</p>

<p>Lords (including Lucius), Alcibiades, and Ventidius</p>

<p>(which Timon redeemed from prison). Flavius and others</p>

<p>are in attendance. Then comes dropping after all</p>

<p>Apemantus discontentedly like himself.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ventidius</span>  Most honored Timon,</p>

<p>It hath pleased the gods to remember my father’s age</p>

<p>And call him to long peace.</p>

<p>He is gone happy and has left me rich.</p>

<p>Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound</p>

<p>To your free heart, I do return those talents,</p>

<p>Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help</p>

<p>I derived liberty.     <i><i>[He offers a purse.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  O, by no means,</p>

<p>Honest Ventidius. You mistake my love.</p>

<p>I gave it freely ever, and there’s none</p>

<p>Can truly say he gives if he receives.</p>

<p>If our betters play at that game, we must not dare</p>

<p>To imitate them. Faults that are rich are fair.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ventidius</span>  A noble spirit!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Nay, my lords, ceremony was but devised at first</p>

<p>To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,</p>

<p>Recanting goodness, sorry ere ’tis shown;</p>

<p>But where there is true friendship, there needs none.</p>

<p>Pray, sit. More welcome are you to my fortunes</p>

<p>Than my fortunes to me.     <i><i>[They sit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  My lord, we always have confessed it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>Ho, ho, “confessed it”? Hanged it, have you not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  O Apemantus, you are welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  No, you shall not make me welcome.</p>

<p>I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Fie, thou ’rt a churl. You’ve got a humor there</p>

<p>Does not become a man. ’Tis much to blame.–</p>

<p>They say, my lords, Ira furor brevis est, but yond</p>

<p>man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by</p>

<p>himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is</p>

<p>he fit for ’t indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon. I</p>

<p>come to observe; I give thee warning on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  I take no heed of thee. Thou ’rt an Athenian,</p>

<p>therefore welcome. I myself would have no power;</p>

<p>prithee, let my meat make thee silent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  I scorn thy meat. ’Twould choke me, for I</p>

<p>should ne’er flatter thee. <i>[(Apart.)]</i> O you gods,</p>

<p>what a number of men eats Timon, and he sees ’em</p>

<p>not! It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in</p>

<p>one man’s blood; and all the madness is, he cheers</p>

<p>them up too.</p>

<p>I wonder men dare trust themselves with men.</p>

<p>Methinks they should invite them without knives.</p>

<p>Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.</p>

<p>There’s much example for ’t. The fellow that sits</p>

<p>next him, now parts bread with him, pledges the</p>

<p>breath of him in a divided draft, is the readiest</p>

<p>man to kill him. ’T ’as been proved. If I were a huge</p>

<p>man, I should fear to drink at meals,</p>

<p>Lest they should spy my wind-pipe’s dangerous</p>

<p>notes.</p>

<p>Great men should drink with harness on their</p>

<p>throats.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span> <i>[responding to a toast]</i></p>

<p>My lord, in heart! And let the health go round.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  Let it flow this way, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span> <i>[apart]</i>  “Flow this way”? A brave fellow.</p>

<p>He keeps his tides well. Those healths will make</p>

<p>thee and thy state look ill, Timon.</p>

<p>Here’s that which is too weak to be a sinner,</p>

<p>Honest water, which ne’er left man i’ th’ mire.</p>

<p>This and my food are equals. There’s no odds.</p>

<p>Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.</p>

<br/>

<p>Apemantus’ grace.</p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>Immortal gods, I crave no pelf.</i></p>

<p>     <i>I pray for no man but myself.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Grant I may never prove so fond</i></p>

<p>     <i>To trust man on his oath or bond,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Or a harlot for her weeping,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Or a dog that seems a-sleeping,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Or a keeper with my freedom,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Or my friends if I should need ’em.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Amen. So fall to ’t.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Rich men sin, and I eat root.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[He eats and drinks.]</i></center></p>

<p>Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Captain Alcibiades, your heart’s in the field now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  My heart is ever at your service, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies</p>

<p>than a dinner of friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  So they were bleeding new, my lord,</p>

<p>there’s no meat like ’em. I could wish my best</p>

<p>friend at such a feast.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span> <i>[apart]</i>  Would all those flatterers were</p>

<p>thine enemies, then, that then thou mightst kill</p>

<p>’em and bid me to ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  Might we but have that happiness, my</p>

<p>lord, that you would once use our hearts, whereby</p>

<p>we might express some part of our zeals, we</p>

<p>should think ourselves forever perfect.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods</p>

<p>themselves have provided that I shall have much</p>

<p>help from you. How had you been my friends else?</p>

<p>Why have you that charitable title from thousands,</p>

<p>did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told</p>

<p>more of you to myself than you can with modesty</p>

<p>speak in your own behalf. And thus far I confirm</p>

<p>you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any</p>

<p>friends if we should ne’er have need of ’em? They</p>

<p>were the most needless creatures living, should we</p>

<p>ne’er have use for ’em, and would most resemble</p>

<p>sweet instruments hung up in cases, that keeps</p>

<p>their sounds to themselves. Why, I have often</p>

<p>wished myself poorer that I might come nearer to</p>

<p>you. We are born to do benefits. And what better or</p>

<p>properer can we call our own than the riches of</p>

<p>our friends? O, what a precious comfort ’tis to</p>

<p>have so many, like brothers, commanding one</p>

<p>another’s fortunes. O, joy’s e’en made away ere ’t</p>

<p>can be born! Mine eyes cannot hold out water,</p>

<p>methinks. To forget their faults, I drink to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span> <i>[apart]</i>  Thou weep’st to make them drink,</p>

<p>Timon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>Joy had the like conception in our eyes</p>

<p>And, at that instant, like a babe sprung up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span> <i>[apart]</i></p>

<p>Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span> <i>[apart]</i>  Much!     <i><i>[Sound tucket.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  What means that trump?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span>  Please you, my lord, there are certain ladies</p>

<p>most desirous of admittance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Ladies? What are their wills?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span>  There comes with them a forerunner, my lord,</p>

<p>which bears that office to signify their pleasures.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  I pray, let them be admitted.     <i><i>[Servant exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter “Cupid.”]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cupid</span></p>

<p>Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all</p>

<p>That of his bounties taste! The five best senses</p>

<p>Acknowledge thee their patron, and come freely</p>

<p>To gratulate thy plenteous bosom. There</p>

<p>Taste, touch, all, pleased from thy table rise;</p>

<p>They only now come but to feast thine eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>They’re welcome all. Let ’em have kind admittance.</p>

<p>Music, make their welcome!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>You see, my lord, how ample you’re beloved.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Music. Enter the masque of Ladies as Amazons,</p>

<p>with lutes in their hands, dancing and playing.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span> <i>[apart]</i>  Hoy-day!</p>

<p>What a sweep of vanity comes this way.</p>

<p>They dance? They are madwomen.</p>

<p>Like madness is the glory of this life</p>

<p>As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.</p>

<p>We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves</p>

<p>And spend our flatteries to drink those men</p>

<p>Upon whose age we void it up again</p>

<p>With poisonous spite and envy.</p>

<p>Who lives that’s not depraved or depraves?</p>

<p>Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves</p>

<p>Of their friends’ gift?</p>

<p>I should fear those that dance before me now</p>

<p>Would one day stamp upon me. ’T ’as been done.</p>

<p>Men shut their doors against a setting sun.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of Timon,</p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,</p>

<p>Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,</p>

<p>Which was not half so beautiful and kind.</p>

<p>You have added worth unto ’t and luster,</p>

<p>Kind my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>My lord, there are certain nobles of the Senate</p>

<p>Newly alighted and come to visit you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>They are fairly welcome.     <i><i>[Servant exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span>  I beseech your Honor,</p>

<p>Vouchsafe me a word. It does concern you near.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Near? Why, then, another time I’ll hear thee.</p>

<p>I prithee, let’s be provided to show them</p>

<p>entertainment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span> <i>[aside]</i>  I scarce know how.</p>

<p><center><i>[Enter another Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Servant</span></p>

<p>May it please your Honor, Lord Lucius,</p>

<p>Out of his free love, hath presented to you</p>

<p>Four milk-white horses trapped in silver.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>I shall accept them fairly. Let the presents</p>

<p>Be worthily entertained.     <i><i>[Servant exits.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[Enter a third Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now? What news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Servant</span>  Please you, my lord, that honorable</p>

<p>gentleman Lord Lucullus entreats your company</p>

<p>tomorrow to hunt with him and has sent your</p>

<p>Honor two brace of greyhounds.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>I’ll hunt with him; and let them be received,</p>

<p>Not without fair reward.     <i><i>[Servant exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span> <i>[aside]</i>  What will this come to?</p>

<p>He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,</p>

<p>And all out of an empty coffer.</p>

<p>Nor will he know his purse or yield me this–</p>

<p>To show him what a beggar his heart is,</p>

<p>Being of no power to make his wishes good.</p>

<p>His promises fly so beyond his state</p>

<p>That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes</p>

<p>For ev’ry word. He is so kind that he</p>

<p>Now pays interest for ’t. His land’s put to their books.</p>

<p>Well, would I were gently put out of office</p>

<p>Before I were forced out.</p>

<p>Happier is he that has no friend to feed</p>

<p>Than such that do e’en enemies exceed.</p>

<p>I bleed inwardly for my lord.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span> <i>[to Lords]</i>  You do yourselves much wrong.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span>  O, he’s the very soul of bounty!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  And now I remember, my lord, you gave good</p>

<p>O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>You may take my word, my lord. I know no man</p>

<p>Can justly praise but what he does affect.</p>

<p>I weigh my friends’ affection with mine own.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you true, I’ll call to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>Lords</span>  O, none so welcome.</p>

<p>Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends</p>

<p>And ne’er be weary.–Alcibiades,</p>

<p>Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  What a coil’s here,</p>

<p>Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!</p>

<p>I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums</p>

<p>Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs.</p>

<p>long, Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself</p>
