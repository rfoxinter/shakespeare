<p><center><i>[Enter Steward Flavius, with many bills in his hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span></p>

<p>No care, no stop, so senseless of expense</p>

<p>That he will neither know how to maintain it</p>

<p>Nor cease his flow of riot. Takes no account</p>

<p>How things go from him nor resumes no care</p>

<p>Of what is to continue. Never mind</p>

<p>Was to be so unwise to be so kind.</p>

<p>What shall be done? He will not hear till feel.</p>

<p>I must be round with him, now he comes from</p>

<p>hunting.</p>

<p>Fie, fie, fie, fie!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Caphis, and the Men of Isidore and Varro.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caphis</span></p>

<p>Good even, Varro. What, you come for money?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  Is ’t not your business too?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caphis</span>  It is. And yours too, Isidore?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isidore’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  It is so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caphis</span>  Would we were all discharged!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  I fear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caphis</span>  Here comes the lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Timon, and his train, with Alcibiades.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>So soon as dinner’s done we’ll forth again,</p>

<p>My Alcibiades. <i>[(To Caphis.)]</i> With me? What is your</p>

<p>will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caphis</span> <i>[offering Timon a paper]</i></p>

<p>My lord, here is a note of certain dues.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Dues? Whence are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caphis</span>  Of Athens here, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Go to my steward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caphis</span></p>

<p>Please it your Lordship, he hath put me off</p>

<p>To the succession of new days this month.</p>

<p>My master is awaked by great occasion</p>

<p>To call upon his own and humbly prays you</p>

<p>That with your other noble parts you’ll suit</p>

<p>In giving him his right.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Mine honest friend,</p>

<p>I prithee but repair to me next morning.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caphis</span></p>

<p>Nay, good my lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Contain thyself, good friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span> <i>[offering a paper]</i>  One Varro’s servant,</p>

<p>my good lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isidore’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span> <i>[offering a paper]</i></p>

<p>From Isidore. He humbly prays your speedy</p>

<p>payment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span></p>

<p>’Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks and past.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isidore’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span></p>

<p>Your steward puts me off, my lord, and I</p>

<p>Am sent expressly to your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Give me breath.–</p>

<p>I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on.</p>

<p>I’ll wait upon you instantly.</p>

<p><center><i>[Alcibiades and Timon’s train exit.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Flavius.]</i> Come hither. Pray you,</p>

<p>How goes the world that I am thus encountered</p>

<p>With clamorous demands of debt, broken bonds,</p>

<p>And the detention of long-since-due debts</p>

<p>Against my honor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span> <i>[to the creditors’ Men]</i>  Please you, gentlemen,</p>

<p>The time is unagreeable to this business.</p>

<p>Your importunacy cease till after dinner,</p>

<p>That I may make his Lordship understand</p>

<p>Wherefore you are not paid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Do so, my friends.–</p>

<p>See them well entertained.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span>  Pray, draw near.</p>

<p><center><i>[Timon and Flavius exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Apemantus and Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caphis</span>  Stay, stay, here comes the Fool with Apemantus.</p>

<p>Let’s ha’ some sport with ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  Hang him! He’ll abuse us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isidore’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  A plague upon him, dog!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  How dost, Fool?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Dost dialogue with thy shadow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  I speak not to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  No, ’tis to thyself. <i>[(To the Fool.)]</i> Come</p>

<p>away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isidore’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span> <i>[to Varro’s Man]</i>  There’s the fool hangs</p>

<p>on your back already.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  No, thou stand’st single; thou ’rt not on</p>

<p>him yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caphis</span> <i>[to Isidore’s Man]</i>  Where’s the fool now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  He last asked the question. Poor rogues</p>

<p>and usurers’ men, bawds between gold and want.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>The</span> <span class='sc'>Men</span>  What are we, Apemantus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Asses.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>The</span> <span class='sc'>Men</span>  Why?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  That you ask me what you are, and do not</p>

<p>know yourselves.–Speak to ’em, Fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  How do you, gentlemen?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>The</span> <span class='sc'>Men</span>  Gramercies, good Fool. How does your</p>

<p>mistress?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  She’s e’en setting on water to scald such chickens</p>

<p>as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Good. Gramercy.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Look you, here comes my master’s page.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span> <i>[to Fool]</i>  Why, how now, captain? What do you in</p>

<p>this wise company?–How dost thou, Apemantus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Would I had a rod in my mouth that I</p>

<p>might answer thee profitably.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription</p>

<p>of these letters. I know not which is which.</p>

<p><center><i>[He shows some papers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Canst not read?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  There will little learning die, then, that</p>

<p>day thou art hanged. This is to Lord Timon, this to</p>

<p>Alcibiades. Go. Thou wast born a bastard, and</p>

<p>thou ’lt die a bawd.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Page</span>  Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish</p>

<p>a dog’s death. Answer not. I am gone.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  E’en so thou outrunn’st grace.–Fool, I</p>

<p>will go with you to Lord Timon’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Will you leave me there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  If Timon stay at home.–You three serve</p>

<p>three usurers?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>The</span> <span class='sc'>Men</span>  Ay. Would they served us!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  So would I–as good a trick as ever hangman</p>

<p>served thief.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Are you three usurers’ men?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>The</span> <span class='sc'>Men</span>  Ay, fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant.</p>

<p>My mistress is one, and I am her Fool. When men</p>

<p>come to borrow of your masters, they approach</p>

<p>sadly and go away merry, but they enter my master’s</p>

<p>house merrily and go away sadly. The reason</p>

<p>of this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  I could render one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Do it then, that we may account thee a</p>

<p>whoremaster and a knave, which notwithstanding,</p>

<p>thou shalt be no less esteemed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  What is a whoremaster, fool?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  A fool in good clothes, and something like thee.</p>

<p>’Tis a spirit; sometime ’t appears like a lord, sometime</p>

<p>like a lawyer, sometime like a philosopher,</p>

<p>with two stones more than ’s artificial one. He is</p>

<p>very often like a knight, and generally in all shapes</p>

<p>that man goes up and down in from fourscore to</p>

<p>thirteen, this spirit walks in.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro’s</span> <span class='sc'>Man</span>  Thou art not altogether a Fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Nor thou altogether a wise man. As much foolery</p>

<p>as I have, so much wit thou lack’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  That answer might have become Apemantus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <span class='sc'>The</span> <span class='sc'>Men</span>  Aside, aside! Here comes Lord Timon.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Timon and Steward Flavius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Come with me, fool, come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I do not always follow lover, elder brother, and</p>

<p>woman; sometime the philosopher.</p>

<p><center><i>[Apemantus and the Fool exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span> <i>[to the creditors’ Men]</i></p>

<p>Pray you, walk near. I’ll speak with you anon.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Men exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>You make me marvel wherefore ere this time</p>

<p>Had you not fully laid my state before me,</p>

<p>That I might so have rated my expense</p>

<p>As I had leave of means.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span>  You would not hear me.</p>

<p>At many leisures I proposed–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Go to.</p>

<p>Perchance some single vantages you took</p>

<p>When my indisposition put you back,</p>

<p>And that unaptness made your minister</p>

<p>Thus to excuse yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span>  O, my good lord,</p>

<p>At many times I brought in my accounts,</p>

<p>Laid them before you. You would throw them off</p>

<p>And say you found them in mine honesty.</p>

<p>When for some trifling present you have bid me</p>

<p>Return so much, I have shook my head and wept–</p>

<p>Yea, ’gainst th’ authority of manners prayed you</p>

<p>To hold your hand more close. I did endure</p>

<p>Not seldom nor no slight checks when I have</p>

<p>Prompted you in the ebb of your estate</p>

<p>And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,</p>

<p>Though you hear now too late, yet now’s a time.</p>

<p>The greatest of your having lacks a half</p>

<p>To pay your present debts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Let all my land be sold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span></p>

<p>’Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone,</p>

<p>And what remains will hardly stop the mouth</p>

<p>Of present dues. The future comes apace.</p>

<p>What shall defend the interim? And at length</p>

<p>How goes our reck’ning?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>To Lacedaemon did my land extend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span></p>

<p>O my good lord, the world is but a word.</p>

<p>Were it all yours to give it in a breath,</p>

<p>How quickly were it gone!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  You tell me true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span></p>

<p>If you suspect my husbandry of falsehood,</p>

<p>Call me before th’ exactest auditors,</p>

<p>And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,</p>

<p>When all our offices have been oppressed</p>

<p>With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept</p>

<p>With drunken spilth of wine, when every room</p>

<p>Hath blazed with lights and brayed with minstrelsy,</p>

<p>I have retired me to a wasteful cock</p>

<p>And set mine eyes at flow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Prithee, no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span></p>

<p>Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!</p>

<p>How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants</p>

<p>This night englutted. Who is not Timon’s?</p>

<p>What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord</p>

<p>Timon’s?</p>

<p>Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!</p>

<p>Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,</p>

<p>The breath is gone whereof this praise is made.</p>

<p>Feast-won, fast-lost. One cloud of winter showers,</p>

<p>These flies are couched.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Come, sermon me no further.</p>

<p>No villainous bounty yet hath passed my heart;</p>

<p>Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.</p>

<p>Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack</p>

<p>To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart.</p>

<p>If I would broach the vessels of my love</p>

<p>And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,</p>

<p>Men and men’s fortunes could I frankly use</p>

<p>As I can bid thee speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span>  Assurance bless your thoughts!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>And in some sort these wants of mine are crowned,</p>

<p>That I account them blessings. For by these</p>

<p>Shall I try friends. You shall perceive how you</p>

<p>Mistake my fortunes. I am wealthy in my friends.–</p>

<p>Within there! Flaminius!–Servilius!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter three Servants, Flaminius, Servilius, and another.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servants</span>  My lord, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  I will dispatch you severally. <i>[(To Servilius)]</i></p>

<p>You to Lord Lucius, <i>[(to Flaminius)]</i> to Lord</p>

<p>Lucullus you–I hunted with his Honor today; <i>[(to</p>

<p>the third Servant)]</i> you to Sempronius. Commend</p>

<p>me to their loves, and I am proud, say, that my</p>

<p>occasions have found time to use ’em toward a</p>

<p>supply of money. Let the request be fifty talents.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flaminius</span>  As you have said, my lord.     <i><i>[Servants exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Lord Lucius and Lucullus? Humh!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Go you, sir, to the Senators,</p>

<p>Of whom, even to the state’s best health, I have</p>

<p>Deserved this hearing. Bid ’em send o’ th’ instant</p>

<p>A thousand talents to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span>  I have been bold–</p>

<p>For that I knew it the most general way–</p>

<p>To them to use your signet and your name,</p>

<p>But they do shake their heads, and I am here</p>

<p>No richer in return.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Is ’t true? Can ’t be?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span></p>

<p>They answer in a joint and corporate voice</p>

<p>That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot</p>

<p>Do what they would, are sorry. You are honorable,</p>

<p>But yet they could have wished–they know not–</p>

<p>Something hath been amiss–a noble nature</p>

<p>May catch a wrench–would all were well–’tis pity.</p>

<p>And so, intending other serious matters,</p>

<p>After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,</p>

<p>With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods</p>

<p>They froze me into silence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  You gods, reward them!</p>

<p>Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows</p>

<p>Have their ingratitude in them hereditary.</p>

<p>Their blood is caked, ’tis cold, it seldom flows;</p>

<p>’Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;</p>

<p>And nature, as it grows again toward earth,</p>

<p>Is fashioned for the journey, dull and heavy.</p>

<p>Go to Ventidius. Prithee, be not sad.</p>

<p>Thou art true and honest–ingeniously I speak–</p>

<p>No blame belongs to thee. Ventidius lately</p>

<p>Buried his father, by whose death he’s stepped</p>

<p>Into a great estate. When he was poor,</p>

<p>Imprisoned, and in scarcity of friends,</p>

<p>I cleared him with five talents. Greet him from me.</p>

<p>Bid him suppose some good necessity</p>

<p>Touches his friend, which craves to be remembered</p>

<p>With those five talents. That had, give ’t these fellows</p>

<p>To whom ’tis instant due. Ne’er speak or think</p>

<p>That Timon’s fortunes ’mong his friends can sink.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span>  I would I could not think it.</p>

<p>That thought is bounty’s foe;</p>

<p>Being free itself, it thinks all others so.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
