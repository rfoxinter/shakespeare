<p><center><i>[Music. Enter divers Friends at several doors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  The good time of day to you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  I also wish it to you. I think this honorable</p>

<p>lord did but try us this other day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Upon that were my thoughts tiring when</p>

<p>we encountered. I hope it is not so low with him as</p>

<p>he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  It should not be, by the persuasion of</p>

<p>his new feasting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  I should think so. He hath sent me an</p>

<p>earnest inviting, which many my near occasions</p>

<p>did urge me to put off; but he hath conjured me</p>

<p>beyond them, and I must needs appear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  In like manner was I in debt to my</p>

<p>importunate business, but he would not hear my</p>

<p>excuse. I am sorry, when he sent to borrow of me,</p>

<p>that my provision was out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  I am sick of that grief too, as I understand</p>

<p>how all things go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Every man here’s so. What would he</p>

<p>have borrowed of you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  A thousand pieces.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  A thousand pieces!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  What of you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  He sent to me, sir–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Timon and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here he comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  With all my heart, gentlemen both! And how</p>

<p>fare you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Ever at the best, hearing well of your</p>

<p>Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  The swallow follows not summer</p>

<p>more willing than we your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Nor more willingly leaves winter, such</p>

<p>summer birds are men.–Gentlemen, our dinner</p>

<p>will not recompense this long stay. Feast your ears</p>

<p>with the music awhile, if they will fare so harshly</p>

<p>o’ th’ trumpets’ sound. We shall to ’t presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  I hope it remains not unkindly with your</p>

<p>Lordship that I returned you an empty messenger.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  O, sir, let it not trouble you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  My noble lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Ah, my good friend, what cheer?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  My most honorable lord, I am e’en</p>

<p>sick of shame that when your Lordship this other</p>

<p>day sent to me, I was so unfortunate a beggar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Think not on ’t, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  If you had sent but two hours before–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Let it not cumber your better remembrance.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The banquet brought in.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>Come, bring in all together.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  All covered dishes!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Royal cheer, I warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Doubt not that, if money and the season</p>

<p>can yield it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  How do you? What’s the news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Alcibiades is banished. Hear you of it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>And</span> <span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friends</span>  Alcibiades banished?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  ’Tis so. Be sure of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  How? How?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  I pray you, upon what?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  My worthy friends, will you draw near?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  I’ll tell you more anon. Here’s a noble</p>

<p>feast toward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  This is the old man still.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Will ’t hold? Will ’t hold?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  It does, but time will–and so–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  I do conceive.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Each man to his stool, with that spur as he</p>

<p>would to the lip of his mistress. Your diet shall</p>

<p>be in all places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let</p>

<p>the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place.</p>

<p>Sit, sit. <i>[(They sit.)]</i> The gods require our thanks:</p>

<br/>

<p>You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with</p>

<p>thankfulness. For your own gifts make yourselves</p>

<p>praised, but reserve still to give, lest your deities be</p>

<p>despised. Lend to each man enough, that one need</p>

<p>not lend to another; for, were your godheads to</p>

<p>borrow of men, men would forsake the gods. Make</p>

<p>the meat be beloved more than the man that gives</p>

<p>it. Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of</p>

<p>villains. If there sit twelve women at the table, let a</p>

<p>dozen of them be as they are. The rest of your fees,</p>

<p>O gods, the Senators of Athens, together with the</p>

<p>common tag of people, what is amiss in them,</p>

<p>you gods, make suitable for destruction. For these</p>

<p>my present friends, as they are to me nothing, so</p>

<p>in nothing bless them, and to nothing are they</p>

<p>welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p>Uncover, dogs, and lap.</p>

<p><center><i>[The dishes are uncovered. They contain</p>

<p>only water and stones.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Some</span> <span class='sc'>Speak</span>  What does his Lordship mean?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Some</span> <span class='sc'>Other</span>  I know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>May you a better feast never behold,</p>

<p>You knot of mouth-friends! Smoke and lukewarm</p>

<p>water</p>

<p>Is your perfection. This is Timon’s last,</p>

<p>Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,</p>

<p>Washes it off and sprinkles in your faces</p>

<p>Your reeking villainy. <i>[(He throws water in their</p>

<p>faces.)]</i> Live loathed and long,</p>

<p>Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,</p>

<p>Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,</p>

<p>You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time’s flies,</p>

<p>Cap-and-knee slaves, vapors, and minute-jacks.</p>

<p>Of man and beast the infinite malady</p>

<p>Crust you quite o’er! <i>[(They stand.)]</i> What, dost thou</p>

<p>go?</p>

<p>Soft! Take thy physic first–thou too–and thou.–</p>

<p>Stay. I will lend thee money, borrow none.</p>

<p><center><i>[He attacks them and forces them out.]</i></center></p>

<p>What? All in motion? Henceforth be no feast</p>

<p>Whereat a villain’s not a welcome guest.</p>

<p>Burn, house! Sink, Athens! Henceforth hated be</p>

<p>Of Timon man and all humanity!     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Timon’s Friends, the Senators, with other Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  How now, my lords?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Know you the quality of Lord Timon’s</p>

<p>fury?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Push! Did you see my cap?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fourth</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  I have lost my gown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  He’s but a mad lord, and naught but</p>

<p>humors sways him. He gave me a jewel th’ other</p>

<p>day, and now he has beat it out of my hat. Did you</p>

<p>see my jewel?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Did you see my cap?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Here ’tis.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fourth</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Here lies my gown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  Let’s make no stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span></p>

<p>Lord Timon’s mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span>  I feel ’t upon my bones.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fourth</span> <span class='sc'>Friend</span></p>

<p>One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.</p>
