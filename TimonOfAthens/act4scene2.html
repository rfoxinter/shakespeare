<p><center><i>[Enter Steward Flavius with two or three Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>Hear you, Master Steward, where’s our master?</p>

<p>Are we undone, cast off, nothing remaining?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc></p>

<p>Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?</p>

<p>Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,</p>

<p>I am as poor as you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servant</sc>  Such a house broke?</p>

<p>So noble a master fall’n, all gone, and not</p>

<p>One friend to take his fortune by the arm</p>

<p>And go along with him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Servant</sc>  As we do turn our backs</p>

<p>From our companion thrown into his grave,</p>

<p>So his familiars to his buried fortunes</p>

<p>Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,</p>

<p>Like empty purses picked; and his poor self,</p>

<p>A dedicated beggar to the air,</p>

<p>With his disease of all-shunned poverty,</p>

<p>Walks, like contempt, alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter other Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>More of our fellows.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc></p>

<p>All broken implements of a ruined house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>Yet do our hearts wear Timon’s livery.</p>

<p>That see I by our faces. We are fellows still,</p>

<p>Serving alike in sorrow. Leaked is our bark,</p>

<p>And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,</p>

<p>Hearing the surges threat. We must all part</p>

<p>Into this sea of air.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc>  Good fellows all,</p>

<p>The latest of my wealth I’ll share amongst you.</p>

<p>Wherever we shall meet, for Timon’s sake</p>

<p>Let’s yet be fellows. Let’s shake our heads and say,</p>

<p>As ’twere a knell unto our master’s fortunes,</p>

<p>“We have seen better days.” <i>[(He offers them</p>

<p>money.)]</i> Let each take some.</p>

<p>Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more.</p>

<p>Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Servants embrace and part several ways.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!</p>

<p>Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,</p>

<p>Since riches point to misery and contempt?</p>

<p>Who would be so mocked with glory, or to live</p>

<p>But in a dream of friendship,</p>

<p>To have his pomp and all what state compounds</p>

<p>But only painted, like his varnished friends?</p>

<p>Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,</p>

<p>Undone by goodness! Strange unusual blood</p>

<p>When man’s worst sin is he does too much good!</p>

<p>Who then dares to be half so kind again?</p>

<p>For bounty, that makes gods, do still mar men.</p>

<p>My dearest lord, blest to be most accursed,</p>

<p>Rich only to be wretched, thy great fortunes</p>

<p>Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!</p>

<p>He’s flung in rage from this ingrateful seat</p>

<p>Of monstrous friends,</p>

<p>Nor has he with him to supply his life,</p>

<p>Or that which can command it.</p>

<p>I’ll follow and inquire him out.</p>

<p>I’ll ever serve his mind with my best will.</p>

<p>Whilst I have gold, I’ll be his steward still.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
