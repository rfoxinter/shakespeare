<p><center><i>[Enter three Senators at one door, Alcibiades meeting</p>

<p>them, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span> <i>[to the Second Senator]</i></p>

<p>My lord, you have my voice to ’t. The fault’s</p>

<p>Bloody. ’Tis necessary he should die.</p>

<p>Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  Most true. The law shall bruise ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>Honor, health, and compassion to the Senate!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  Now, captain?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>I am an humble suitor to your virtues,</p>

<p>For pity is the virtue of the law,</p>

<p>And none but tyrants use it cruelly.</p>

<p>It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy</p>

<p>Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood</p>

<p>Hath stepped into the law, which is past depth</p>

<p>To those that without heed do plunge into ’t.</p>

<p>He is a man–setting his fate aside–</p>

<p>Of comely virtues.</p>

<p>Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice–</p>

<p>An honor in him which buys out his fault–</p>

<p>But with a noble fury and fair spirit,</p>

<p>Seeing his reputation touched to death,</p>

<p>He did oppose his foe;</p>

<p>And with such sober and unnoted passion</p>

<p>He did behave his anger, ere ’twas spent,</p>

<p>As if he had but proved an argument.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span></p>

<p>You undergo too strict a paradox,</p>

<p>Striving to make an ugly deed look fair.</p>

<p>Your words have took such pains as if they labored</p>

<p>To bring manslaughter into form and set quarreling</p>

<p>Upon the head of valor–which indeed</p>

<p>Is valor misbegot, and came into the world</p>

<p>When sects and factions were newly born.</p>

<p>He’s truly valiant that can wisely suffer</p>

<p>The worst that man can breathe</p>

<p>And make his wrongs his outsides,</p>

<p>To wear them like his raiment, carelessly,</p>

<p>And ne’er prefer his injuries to his heart</p>

<p>To bring it into danger.</p>

<p>If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,</p>

<p>What folly ’tis to hazard life for ill!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>My lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  You cannot make gross sins look clear.</p>

<p>To revenge is no valor, but to bear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>My lords, then, under favor, pardon me</p>

<p>If I speak like a captain.</p>

<p>Why do fond men expose themselves to battle</p>

<p>And not endure all threats? Sleep upon ’t,</p>

<p>And let the foes quietly cut their throats</p>

<p>Without repugnancy? If there be</p>

<p>Such valor in the bearing, what make we</p>

<p>Abroad? Why, then, women are more valiant</p>

<p>That stay at home, if bearing carry it,</p>

<p>And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon</p>

<p>Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,</p>

<p>If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,</p>

<p>As you are great, be pitifully good.</p>

<p>Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?</p>

<p>To kill, I grant, is sin’s extremest gust,</p>

<p>But in defense, by mercy, ’tis most just.</p>

<p>To be in anger is impiety,</p>

<p>But who is man that is not angry?</p>

<p>Weigh but the crime with this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  You breathe in vain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  In vain? His service done</p>

<p>At Lacedaemon and Byzantium</p>

<p>Were a sufficient briber for his life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  What’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>Why, I say, my lords, has done fair service</p>

<p>And slain in fight many of your enemies.</p>

<p>How full of valor did he bear himself</p>

<p>In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span></p>

<p>He has made too much plenty with ’em.</p>

<p>He’s a sworn rioter. He has a sin</p>

<p>That often drowns him and takes his valor prisoner.</p>

<p>If there were no foes, that were enough</p>

<p>To overcome him. In that beastly fury,</p>

<p>He has been known to commit outrages</p>

<p>And cherish factions. ’Tis inferred to us</p>

<p>His days are foul and his drink dangerous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span></p>

<p>He dies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  Hard fate! He might have died in war.</p>

<p>My lords, if not for any parts in him–</p>

<p>Though his right arm might purchase his own time</p>

<p>And be in debt to none–yet, more to move you,</p>

<p>Take my deserts to his and join ’em both.</p>

<p>And, for I know your reverend ages love</p>

<p>Security, I’ll pawn my victories, all</p>

<p>My honor, to you, upon his good returns.</p>

<p>If by this crime he owes the law his life,</p>

<p>Why, let the war receive ’t in valiant gore,</p>

<p>For law is strict, and war is nothing more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span></p>

<p>We are for law. He dies. Urge it no more,</p>

<p>On height of our displeasure. Friend or brother,</p>

<p>He forfeits his own blood that spills another.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  Must it be so? It must not be.</p>

<p>My lords, I do beseech you, know me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  How?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  Call me to your remembrances.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  What?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>I cannot think but your age has forgot me.</p>

<p>It could not else be I should prove so base</p>

<p>To sue and be denied such common grace.</p>

<p>My wounds ache at you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  Do you dare our anger?</p>

<p>’Tis in few words, but spacious in effect:</p>

<p>We banish thee forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  Banish me?</p>

<p>Banish your dotage, banish usury,</p>

<p>That makes the Senate ugly!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span></p>

<p>If after two days’ shine Athens contain thee,</p>

<p>Attend our weightier judgment.</p>

<p>And, not to swell our spirit,</p>

<p>He shall be executed presently.     <i><i>[Senators exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live</p>

<p>Only in bone, that none may look on you!–</p>

<p>I’m worse than mad. I have kept back their foes</p>

<p>While they have told their money and let out</p>

<p>Their coin upon large interest, I myself</p>

<p>Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?</p>

<p>Is this the balsam that the usuring Senate</p>

<p>Pours into captains’ wounds? Banishment.</p>

<p>It comes not ill. I hate not to be banished.</p>

<p>It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,</p>

<p>That I may strike at Athens. I’ll cheer up</p>

<p>My discontented troops and lay for hearts.</p>

<p>’Tis honor with most lands to be at odds.</p>

<p>Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.</p>
