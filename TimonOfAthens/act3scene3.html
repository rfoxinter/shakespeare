<p><center><i>[Enter a Third Servant of Timon’s with Sempronius,</p>

<p>another of Timon’s friends.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sempronius</span></p>

<p>Must he needs trouble me in ’t? Hum! ’Bove all others?</p>

<p>He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;</p>

<p>And now Ventidius is wealthy too,</p>

<p>Whom he redeemed from prison. All these</p>

<p>Owes their estates unto him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span>  My lord,</p>

<p>They have all been touched and found base metal,</p>

<p>For they have all denied him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sempronius</span>  How? Have they denied him?</p>

<p>Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him,</p>

<p>And does he send to me? Three? Humh!</p>

<p>It shows but little love or judgment in him.</p>

<p>Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians,</p>

<p>Thrive, give him over. Must I take th’ cure upon me?</p>

<p>Has much disgraced me in ’t. I’m angry at him</p>

<p>That might have known my place. I see no sense for ’t</p>

<p>But his occasions might have wooed me first;</p>

<p>For, in my conscience, I was the first man</p>

<p>That e’er received gift from him.</p>

<p>And does he think so backwardly of me now</p>

<p>That I’ll requite it last? No.</p>

<p>So it may prove an argument of laughter</p>

<p>To th’ rest, and I ’mongst lords be thought a fool.</p>

<p>I’d rather than the worth of thrice the sum</p>

<p>Had sent to me first, but for my mind’s sake;</p>

<p>I’d such a courage to do him good. But now return,</p>

<p>And with their faint reply this answer join:</p>

<p>Who bates mine honor shall not know my coin.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span>  Excellent! Your Lordship’s a goodly villain.</p>

<p>The devil knew not what he did when he made</p>

<p>man politic. He crossed himself by ’t, and I cannot</p>

<p>think but, in the end, the villainies of man will set</p>

<p>him clear. How fairly this lord strives to appear</p>

<p>foul! Takes virtuous copies to be wicked, like those</p>

<p>that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms</p>

<p>on fire.</p>

<p>Of such a nature is his politic love.</p>

<p>This was my lord’s best hope. Now all are fled,</p>

<p>Save only the gods. Now his friends are dead,</p>

<p>Doors that were ne’er acquainted with their wards</p>

<p>Many a bounteous year must be employed</p>

<p>Now to guard sure their master.</p>

<p>And this is all a liberal course allows:</p>

<p>Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.</p>
