<p><center><i>[Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweler, and Merchant, at several</p>

<p>doors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  Good day, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  I am glad you’re well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc></p>

<p>I have not seen you long. How goes the world?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc></p>

<p>It wears, sir, as it grows.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  Ay, that’s well known.</p>

<p>But what particular rarity, what strange,</p>

<p>Which manifold record not matches? See,</p>

<p>Magic of bounty, all these spirits thy power</p>

<p>Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  I know them both. Th’ other’s a jeweler.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Merchant</sc> <i>[to Jeweler]</i></p>

<p>O, ’tis a worthy lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jeweler</sc>  Nay, that’s most fixed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Merchant</sc></p>

<p>A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,</p>

<p>To an untirable and continuate goodness.</p>

<p>He passes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jeweler</sc>  I have a jewel here–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Merchant</sc></p>

<p>O, pray, let’s see ’t. For the Lord Timon, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jeweler</sc></p>

<p>If he will touch the estimate. But for that–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc> <i>[to Painter]</i></p>

<p>When we for recompense have praised the vile,</p>

<p>It stains the glory in that happy verse</p>

<p>Which aptly sings the good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Merchant</sc> <i>[looking at the jewel]</i></p>

<p>’Tis a good form.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jeweler</sc>  And rich. Here is a water, look ye.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc> <i>[to Poet]</i></p>

<p>You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication</p>

<p>To the great lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  A thing slipped idly from me.</p>

<p>Our poesy is as a gum which oozes</p>

<p>From whence ’tis nourished. The fire i’ th’ flint</p>

<p>Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame</p>

<p>Provokes itself and, like the current, flies</p>

<p>Each bound it chases. What have you there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc></p>

<p>A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc></p>

<p>Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.</p>

<p>Let’s see your piece.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  ’Tis a good piece.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc></p>

<p>So ’tis. This comes off well and excellent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc></p>

<p>Indifferent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  Admirable! How this grace</p>

<p>Speaks his own standing! What a mental power</p>

<p>This eye shoots forth! How big imagination</p>

<p>Moves in this lip! To th’ dumbness of the gesture</p>

<p>One might interpret.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc></p>

<p>It is a pretty mocking of the life.</p>

<p>Here is a touch. Is ’t good?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  I will say of it,</p>

<p>It tutors nature. Artificial strife</p>

<p>Lives in these touches livelier than life.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter certain Senators.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  How this lord is followed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc></p>

<p>The senators of Athens, happy men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  Look, more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc></p>

<p>You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.</p>

<p><i>[(Indicating his poem.)]</i> I have in this rough work</p>

<p>shaped out a man</p>

<p>Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug</p>

<p>With amplest entertainment. My free drift</p>

<p>Halts not particularly but moves itself</p>

<p>In a wide sea of wax. No leveled malice</p>

<p>Infects one comma in the course I hold,</p>

<p>But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,</p>

<p>Leaving no tract behind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  How shall I understand you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  I will unbolt to you.</p>

<p>You see how all conditions, how all minds,</p>

<p>As well of glib and slipp’ry creatures as</p>

<p>Of grave and austere quality, tender down</p>

<p>Their services to Lord Timon. His large fortune,</p>

<p>Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,</p>

<p>Subdues and properties to his love and tendance</p>

<p>All sorts of hearts–yea, from the glass-faced flatterer</p>

<p>To Apemantus, that few things loves better</p>

<p>Than to abhor himself; even he drops down</p>

<p>The knee before him and returns in peace</p>

<p>Most rich in Timon’s nod.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  I saw them speak together.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc></p>

<p>Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill</p>

<p>Feigned Fortune to be throned. The base o’ th’ mount</p>

<p>Is ranked with all deserts, all kind of natures</p>

<p>That labor on the bosom of this sphere</p>

<p>To propagate their states. Amongst them all</p>

<p>Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fixed,</p>

<p>One do I personate of Lord Timon’s frame,</p>

<p>Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her,</p>

<p>Whose present grace to present slaves and servants</p>

<p>Translates his rivals.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  ’Tis conceived to scope.</p>

<p>This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,</p>

<p>With one man beckoned from the rest below,</p>

<p>Bowing his head against the steepy mount</p>

<p>To climb his happiness, would be well expressed</p>

<p>In our condition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  Nay, sir, but hear me on.</p>

<p>All those which were his fellows but of late,</p>

<p>Some better than his value, on the moment</p>

<p>Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,</p>

<p>Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,</p>

<p>Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him</p>

<p>Drink the free air.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  Ay, marry, what of these?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc></p>

<p>When Fortune in her shift and change of mood</p>

<p>Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants,</p>

<p>Which labored after him to the mountain’s top</p>

<p>Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,</p>

<p>Not one accompanying his declining foot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  ’Tis common.</p>

<p>A thousand moral paintings I can show</p>

<p>That shall demonstrate these quick blows of</p>

<p>Fortune’s</p>

<p>More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well</p>

<p>To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen</p>

<p>The foot above the head.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Trumpets sound. Enter Lord Timon, addressing himself</p>

<p>courteously to every suitor. He is accompanied by a</p>

<p>Messenger and followed by Lucilius and other</p>

<p>Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Imprisoned is he, say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord. Five talents is his debt,</p>

<p>His means most short, his creditors most strait.</p>

<p>Your honorable letter he desires</p>

<p>To those have shut him up, which failing</p>

<p>Periods his comfort.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Noble Ventidius. Well,</p>

<p>I am not of that feather to shake off</p>

<p>My friend when he must need me. I do know him</p>

<p>A gentleman that well deserves a help,</p>

<p>Which he shall have. I’ll pay the debt and free him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  Your Lordship ever binds him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Commend me to him. I will send his ransom;</p>

<p>And, being enfranchised, bid him come to me.</p>

<p>’Tis not enough to help the feeble up,</p>

<p>But to support him after. Fare you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  All happiness to your Honor.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter an old Athenian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Old</sc> <sc>Man</sc></p>

<p>Lord Timon, hear me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Freely, good father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Old</sc> <sc>Man</sc></p>

<p>Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  I have so. What of him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Old</sc> <sc>Man</sc></p>

<p>Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Attends he here or no?–Lucilius!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucilius</sc>  Here, at your Lordship’s service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Old</sc> <sc>Man</sc></p>

<p>This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,</p>

<p>By night frequents my house. I am a man</p>

<p>That from my first have been inclined to thrift,</p>

<p>And my estate deserves an heir more raised</p>

<p>Than one which holds a trencher.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Well. What further?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Old</sc> <sc>Man</sc></p>

<p>One only daughter have I, no kin else</p>

<p>On whom I may confer what I have got.</p>

<p>The maid is fair, o’ th’ youngest for a bride,</p>

<p>And I have bred her at my dearest cost</p>

<p>In qualities of the best. This man of thine</p>

<p>Attempts her love. I prithee, noble lord,</p>

<p>Join with me to forbid him her resort.</p>

<p>Myself have spoke in vain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  The man is honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Old</sc> <sc>Man</sc>  Therefore he will be, Timon.</p>

<p>His honesty rewards him in itself;</p>

<p>It must not bear my daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Does she love him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Old</sc> <sc>Man</sc>  She is young and apt.</p>

<p>Our own precedent passions do instruct us</p>

<p>What levity’s in youth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc> <i>[to Lucilius]</i>  Love you the maid?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucilius</sc></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Old</sc> <sc>Man</sc></p>

<p>If in her marriage my consent be missing–</p>

<p>I call the gods to witness–I will choose</p>

<p>Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world</p>

<p>And dispossess her all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  How shall she be endowed</p>

<p>If she be mated with an equal husband?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Old</sc> <sc>Man</sc></p>

<p>Three talents on the present; in future, all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>This gentleman of mine hath served me long.</p>

<p>To build his fortune, I will strain a little,</p>

<p>For ’tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter.</p>

<p>What you bestow, in him I’ll counterpoise,</p>

<p>And make him weigh with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Old</sc> <sc>Man</sc>  Most noble lord,</p>

<p>Pawn me to this your honor, she is his.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>My hand to thee; mine honor on my promise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucilius</sc></p>

<p>Humbly I thank your Lordship. Never may</p>

<p>That state or fortune fall into my keeping</p>

<p>Which is not owed to you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with the old Athenian.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc> <i>[presenting his poem to Timon]</i></p>

<p>Vouchsafe my labor, and long live your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>I thank you. You shall hear from me anon.</p>

<p>Go not away.–What have you there, my friend?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc></p>

<p>A piece of painting which I do beseech</p>

<p>Your Lordship to accept.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Painting is welcome.</p>

<p>The painting is almost the natural man,</p>

<p>For, since dishonor traffics with man’s nature,</p>

<p>He is but outside; these penciled figures are</p>

<p>Even such as they give out. I like your work,</p>

<p>And you shall find I like it. Wait attendance</p>

<p>Till you hear further from me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  The gods preserve you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Well fare you, gentleman. Give me your hand.</p>

<p>We must needs dine together.–Sir, your jewel</p>

<p>Hath suffered under praise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jeweler</sc>  What, my lord? Dispraise?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>A mere satiety of commendations.</p>

<p>If I should pay you for ’t as ’tis extolled,</p>

<p>It would unclew me quite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jeweler</sc>  My lord, ’tis rated</p>

<p>As those which sell would give. But you well know</p>

<p>Things of like value, differing in the owners,</p>

<p>Are prized by their masters. Believe ’t, dear lord,</p>

<p>You mend the jewel by the wearing it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Well mocked.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Merchant</sc></p>

<p>No, my good lord. He speaks the common tongue,</p>

<p>Which all men speak with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Apemantus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Look who comes here. Will you be chid?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jeweler</sc>  We’ll bear, with your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Merchant</sc>  He’ll spare none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc></p>

<p>Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow–</p>

<p>When thou art Timon’s dog, and these knaves honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know’st</p>

<p>them not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Are they not Athenians?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Then I repent not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jeweler</sc>  You know me, Apemantus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Thou know’st I do. I called thee by thy</p>

<p>name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Thou art proud, Apemantus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Of nothing so much as that I am not like</p>

<p>Timon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Whither art going?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  To knock out an honest Athenian’s brains.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  That’s a deed thou ’lt die for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Right, if doing nothing be death by th’ law.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  How lik’st thou this picture, Apemantus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  The best, for the innocence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Wrought he not well that painted it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  He wrought better that made the painter,</p>

<p>and yet he’s but a filthy piece of work.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  You’re a dog.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Thy mother’s of my generation. What’s</p>

<p>she, if I be a dog?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  No. I eat not lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  An thou shouldst, thou ’dst anger ladies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  O, they eat lords. So they come by great</p>

<p>bellies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  That’s a lascivious apprehension.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  So thou apprehend’st it. Take it for thy</p>

<p>labor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Not so well as plain-dealing, which will</p>

<p>not cost a man a doit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  What dost thou think ’tis worth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Not worth my thinking.–How now, poet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  How now, philosopher?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Thou liest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  Art not one?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  Then I lie not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Art not a poet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Then thou liest. Look in thy last work,</p>

<p>where thou hast feigned him a worthy fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  That’s not feigned. He is so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee</p>

<p>for thy labor. He that loves to be flattered is worthy</p>

<p>o’ th’ flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  What wouldst do then, Apemantus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  E’en as Apemantus does now–hate a lord</p>

<p>with my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  What? Thyself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Wherefore?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  That I had no angry wit to be a lord.–Art</p>

<p>not thou a merchant?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Merchant</sc>  Ay, Apemantus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Merchant</sc>  If traffic do it, the gods do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Traffic’s thy god, and thy god confound</p>

<p>thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  What trumpet’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>’Tis Alcibiades and some twenty horse,</p>

<p>All of companionship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Pray, entertain them. Give them guide to us.</p>

<p><center><i>[Some Servants exit with Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<p>You must needs dine with me. Go not you hence</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Alcibiades with the rest.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Most welcome, sir.     <i><i>[They bow to each other.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc> <i>[apart]</i>  So, so, there!</p>

<p>Aches contract and starve your supple joints!</p>

<p>That there should be small love amongst these sweet</p>

<p>knaves,</p>

<p>Into baboon and monkey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alcibiades</sc> <i>[to Timon]</i></p>

<p>Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Right welcome, sir.</p>

<p>Ere we depart, we’ll share a bounteous time</p>

<p>In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Apemantus exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter two Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  What time o’ day is ’t, Apemantus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  Time to be honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  That time serves still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc></p>

<p>The most accursed thou, that still omit’st it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Thou art going to Lord Timon’s feast?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc></p>

<p>Ay, to see meat fill knaves, and wine heat fools.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Fare thee well, fare thee well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc></p>

<p>Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Why, Apemantus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc></p>

<p>Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give</p>

<p>thee none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  Hang thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc></p>

<p>No, I will do nothing at thy bidding.</p>

<p>Make thy requests to thy friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Away, unpeaceable dog, or I’ll spurn thee hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Apemantus</sc>  I will fly, like a dog, the heels o’ th’ ass.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>He’s opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in</p>

<p>And taste Lord Timon’s bounty? He outgoes</p>

<p>The very heart of kindness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>He pours it out. Plutus, the god of gold,</p>

<p>Is but his steward. No meed but he repays</p>

<p>Sevenfold above itself. No gift to him</p>

<p>But breeds the giver a return exceeding</p>
