<p><center><i>[Enter Poet and Painter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  As I took note of the place, it cannot be far</p>

<p>where he abides.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  What’s to be thought of him? Does the rumor</p>

<p>hold for true that he’s so full of gold?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  Certain. Alcibiades reports it. Phrynia and</p>

<p>Timandra had gold of him. He likewise enriched</p>

<p>poor straggling soldiers with great quantity. ’Tis</p>

<p>said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  Then this breaking of his has been but a try for</p>

<p>his friends?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  Nothing else. You shall see him a palm in</p>

<p>Athens again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore</p>

<p>’tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in</p>

<p>this supposed distress of his. It will show honestly</p>

<p>in us and is very likely to load our purposes with</p>

<p>what they travail for, if it be a just and true report</p>

<p>that goes of his having.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Timon, behind them, from his cave.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  What have you now to present unto him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  Nothing at this time but my visitation. Only I</p>

<p>will promise him an excellent piece.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  I must serve him so too–tell him of an intent</p>

<p>that’s coming toward him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  Good as the best. Promising is the very air o’</p>

<p>th’ time; it opens the eyes of expectation. Performance</p>

<p>is ever the duller for his act, and but in the</p>

<p>plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying</p>

<p>is quite out of use. To promise is most courtly</p>

<p>and fashionable. Performance is a kind of will or</p>

<p>testament which argues a great sickness in his</p>

<p>judgment that makes it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Excellent workman! Thou canst not</p>

<p>paint a man so bad as is thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  I am thinking what I shall say I have provided</p>

<p>for him. It must be a personating of himself, a</p>

<p>satire against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery</p>

<p>of the infinite flatteries that follow youth</p>

<p>and opulency.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Must thou needs stand for a villain in</p>

<p>thine own work? Wilt thou whip thine own faults</p>

<p>in other men? Do so. I have gold for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  Nay, let’s seek him.</p>

<p>Then do we sin against our own estate</p>

<p>When we may profit meet and come too late.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  True.</p>

<p>When the day serves, before black-cornered night,</p>

<p>Find what thou want’st by free and offered light.</p>

<p>Come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I’ll meet you at the turn. What a god’s gold</p>

<p>That he is worshiped in a baser temple</p>

<p>Than where swine feed!</p>

<p>’Tis thou that rigg’st the bark and plow’st the foam,</p>

<p>Settlest admired reverence in a slave.</p>

<p>To thee be worship, and thy saints for aye</p>

<p>Be crowned with plagues, that thee alone obey!</p>

<p>Fit I meet them.     <i><i>[He comes forward.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc></p>

<p>Hail, worthy Timon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  Our late noble master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Have I once lived to see two honest men?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  Sir,</p>

<p>Having often of your open bounty tasted,</p>

<p>Hearing you were retired, your friends fall’n off,</p>

<p>Whose thankless natures–O, abhorred spirits!</p>

<p>Not all the whips of heaven are large enough–</p>

<p>What, to you,</p>

<p>Whose starlike nobleness gave life and influence</p>

<p>To their whole being? I am rapt and cannot cover</p>

<p>The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude</p>

<p>With any size of words.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Let it go naked. Men may see ’t the better.</p>

<p>You that are honest, by being what you are</p>

<p>Make them best seen and known.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  He and myself</p>

<p>Have travailed in the great shower of your gifts</p>

<p>And sweetly felt it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Ay, you are honest men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc></p>

<p>We are hither come to offer you our service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?</p>

<p>Can you eat roots and drink cold water? No?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc></p>

<p>What we can do we’ll do to do you service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>You’re honest men. You’ve heard that I have gold.</p>

<p>I am sure you have. Speak truth. You’re honest men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc></p>

<p>So it is said, my noble lord, but therefor</p>

<p>Came not my friend nor I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Good honest men. <i>[(To the Painter.)]</i> Thou draw’st a</p>

<p>counterfeit</p>

<p>Best in all Athens. Thou ’rt indeed the best.</p>

<p>Thou counterfeit’st most lively.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  So-so, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>E’en so, sir, as I say. <i>[(To the Poet.)]</i> And for thy</p>

<p>fiction,</p>

<p>Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth</p>

<p>That thou art even natural in thine art.</p>

<p>But for all this, my honest-natured friends,</p>

<p>I must needs say you have a little fault.</p>

<p>Marry, ’tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I</p>

<p>You take much pains to mend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>  Beseech your Honor</p>

<p>To make it known to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  You’ll take it ill.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>  Most thankfully, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Will you indeed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>  Doubt it not, worthy lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>There’s never a one of you but trusts a knave</p>

<p>That mightily deceives you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>  Do we, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,</p>

<p>Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,</p>

<p>Keep in your bosom. Yet remain assured</p>

<p>That he’s a made-up villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Painter</sc>  I know none such, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Poet</sc>  Nor I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Look you, I love you well. I’ll give you gold.</p>

<p>Rid me these villains from your companies,</p>

<p>Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draft,</p>

<p>Confound them by some course, and come to me,</p>

<p>I’ll give you gold enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Both</sc>  Name them, my lord, let ’s know them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>You that way and you this, but two in company.</p>

<p>Each man apart, all single and alone,</p>

<p>Yet an archvillain keeps him company.</p>

<p><i>[(To one.)]</i> If where thou art, two villains shall not be,</p>

<p>Come not near him. <i>[(To the other.)]</i> If thou wouldst</p>

<p>not reside</p>

<p>But where one villain is, then him abandon.–</p>

<p>Hence, pack. There’s gold. You came for gold, you</p>

<p>slaves.</p>

<p><i>[(To one.)]</i> You have work for me. There’s payment.</p>

<p>Hence.</p>

<p><i>[(To the other.)]</i> You are an alchemist; make gold of</p>

<p>that.</p>

<p>Out, rascal dogs!</p>

<p><center><i>[Timon drives them out and then exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Steward Flavius, and two Senators.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc></p>

<p>It is vain that you would speak with Timon,</p>

<p>For he is set so only to himself</p>

<p>That nothing but himself which looks like man</p>

<p>Is friendly with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Bring us to his cave.</p>

<p>It is our part and promise to th’ Athenians</p>

<p>To speak with Timon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  At all times alike</p>

<p>Men are not still the same. ’Twas time and griefs</p>

<p>That framed him thus. Time, with his fairer hand</p>

<p>Offering the fortunes of his former days,</p>

<p>The former man may make him. Bring us to him,</p>

<p>And chance it as it may.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc>  Here is his cave.–</p>

<p>Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!</p>

<p>Look out, and speak to friends. Th’ Athenians</p>

<p>By two of their most reverend Senate greet thee.</p>

<p>Speak to them, noble Timon.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Timon out of his cave.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Thou sun that comforts, burn!–Speak and be</p>

<p>hanged!</p>

<p>For each true word a blister, and each false</p>

<p>Be as a cauterizing to the root o’ th’ tongue,</p>

<p>Consuming it with speaking.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Worthy Timon–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>The Senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>I thank them and would send them back the plague,</p>

<p>Could I but catch it for them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  O, forget</p>

<p>What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.</p>

<p>The Senators with one consent of love</p>

<p>Entreat thee back to Athens, who have thought</p>

<p>On special dignities which vacant lie</p>

<p>For thy best use and wearing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  They confess</p>

<p>Toward thee forgetfulness too general gross;</p>

<p>Which now the public body, which doth seldom</p>

<p>Play the recanter, feeling in itself</p>

<p>A lack of Timon’s aid, hath sense withal</p>

<p>Of it own fall, restraining aid to Timon,</p>

<p>And send forth us to make their sorrowed render,</p>

<p>Together with a recompense more fruitful</p>

<p>Than their offense can weigh down by the dram–</p>

<p>Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth</p>

<p>As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs</p>

<p>And write in thee the figures of their love,</p>

<p>Ever to read them thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  You witch me in it,</p>

<p>Surprise me to the very brink of tears.</p>

<p>Lend me a fool’s heart and a woman’s eyes,</p>

<p>And I’ll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>Therefore, so please thee to return with us</p>

<p>And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take</p>

<p>The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks;</p>

<p>Allowed with absolute power, and thy good name</p>

<p>Live with authority. So soon we shall drive back</p>

<p>Of Alcibiades th’ approaches wild,</p>

<p>Who like a boar too savage doth root up</p>

<p>His country’s peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  And shakes his threat’ning sword</p>

<p>Against the walls of Athens.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Therefore, Timon–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Well sir, I will. Therefore I will, sir, thus:</p>

<p>If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,</p>

<p>Let Alcibiades know this of Timon–</p>

<p>That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens</p>

<p>And take our goodly aged men by th’ beards,</p>

<p>Giving our holy virgins to the stain</p>

<p>Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brained war,</p>

<p>Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it</p>

<p>In pity of our aged and our youth,</p>

<p>I cannot choose but tell him that I care not,</p>

<p>And let him take ’t at worst–for their knives care not,</p>

<p>While you have throats to answer. For myself,</p>

<p>There’s not a whittle in th’ unruly camp</p>

<p>But I do prize it at my love before</p>

<p>The reverend’st throat in Athens. So I leave you</p>

<p>To the protection of the prosperous gods</p>

<p>As thieves to keepers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc> <i>[to Senators]</i>  Stay not. All’s in vain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Why, I was writing of my epitaph.</p>

<p>It will be seen tomorrow. My long sickness</p>

<p>Of health and living now begins to mend,</p>

<p>And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still.</p>

<p>Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,</p>

<p>And last so long enough!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  We speak in vain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>But yet I love my country and am not</p>

<p>One that rejoices in the common wrack,</p>

<p>As common bruit doth put it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  That’s well spoke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Commend me to my loving countrymen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>These words become your lips as they pass through</p>

<p>them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>And enter in our ears like great triumphers</p>

<p>In their applauding gates.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc>  Commend me to them</p>

<p>And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,</p>

<p>Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,</p>

<p>Their pangs of love, with other incident throes</p>

<p>That nature’s fragile vessel doth sustain</p>

<p>In life’s uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do</p>

<p>them.</p>

<p>I’ll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades’ wrath.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc> <i>[to Second Senator]</i></p>

<p>I like this well. He will return again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>I have a tree, which grows here in my close,</p>

<p>That mine own use invites me to cut down,</p>

<p>And shortly must I fell it. Tell my friends,</p>

<p>Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree</p>

<p>From high to low throughout, that whoso please</p>

<p>To stop affliction, let him take his haste,</p>

<p>Come hither ere my tree hath felt the ax,</p>

<p>And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc> <i>[to Senators]</i></p>

<p>Trouble him no further. Thus you still shall find him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Timon</sc></p>

<p>Come not to me again, but say to Athens,</p>

<p>Timon hath made his everlasting mansion</p>

<p>Upon the beached verge of the salt flood,</p>

<p>Who once a day with his embossed froth</p>

<p>The turbulent surge shall cover. Thither come</p>

<p>And let my gravestone be your oracle.</p>

<p>Lips, let four words go by and language end.</p>

<p>What is amiss, plague and infection mend.</p>

<p>Graves only be men’s works, and death their gain.</p>

<p>Sun, hide thy beams. Timon hath done his reign.</p>

<p><center><i>[Timon exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>His discontents are unremovably</p>

<p>Coupled to nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>Our hope in him is dead. Let us return</p>

<p>And strain what other means is left unto us</p>

<p>In our dear peril.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  It requires swift foot.</p>
