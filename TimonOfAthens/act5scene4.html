<p><center><i>[Trumpets sound. Enter Alcibiades with his Powers</p>

<p>before Athens.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>Sound to this coward and lascivious town</p>

<p>Our terrible approach.     <i><i>[Sounds a parley.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The Senators appear upon the walls.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Till now you have gone on and filled the time</p>

<p>With all licentious measure, making your wills</p>

<p>The scope of justice. Till now myself and such</p>

<p>As slept within the shadow of your power</p>

<p>Have wandered with our traversed arms and breathed</p>

<p>Our sufferance vainly. Now the time is flush,</p>

<p>When crouching marrow in the bearer strong</p>

<p>Cries of itself “No more!” Now breathless wrong</p>

<p>Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,</p>

<p>And pursy insolence shall break his wind</p>

<p>With fear and horrid flight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  Noble and young,</p>

<p>When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,</p>

<p>Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,</p>

<p>We sent to thee to give thy rages balm,</p>

<p>To wipe out our ingratitude with loves</p>

<p>Above their quantity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  So did we woo</p>

<p>Transformed Timon to our city’s love</p>

<p>By humble message and by promised means.</p>

<p>We were not all unkind, nor all deserve</p>

<p>The common stroke of war.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  These walls of ours</p>

<p>Were not erected by their hands from whom</p>

<p>You have received your grief, nor are they such</p>

<p>That these great towers, trophies, and schools</p>

<p>should fall</p>

<p>For private faults in them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  Nor are they living</p>

<p>Who were the motives that you first went out.</p>

<p>Shame, that they wanted cunning, in excess</p>

<p>Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,</p>

<p>Into our city with thy banners spread.</p>

<p>By decimation and a tithed death,</p>

<p>If thy revenges hunger for that food</p>

<p>Which nature loathes, take thou the destined tenth</p>

<p>And, by the hazard of the spotted die,</p>

<p>Let die the spotted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  All have not offended.</p>

<p>For those that were, it is not square to take,</p>

<p>On those that are, revenge. Crimes, like lands,</p>

<p>Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,</p>

<p>Bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage.</p>

<p>Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin</p>

<p>Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall</p>

<p>With those that have offended. Like a shepherd</p>

<p>Approach the fold and cull th’ infected forth,</p>

<p>But kill not all together.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  What thou wilt,</p>

<p>Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile</p>

<p>Than hew to ’t with thy sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  Set but thy foot</p>

<p>Against our rampired gates and they shall ope,</p>

<p>So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before</p>

<p>To say thou ’lt enter friendly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Senator</span>  Throw thy glove,</p>

<p>Or any token of thine honor else,</p>

<p>That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress</p>

<p>And not as our confusion, all thy powers</p>

<p>Shall make their harbor in our town till we</p>

<p>Have sealed thy full desire.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  Then there’s my glove.</p>

<p>Descend and open your uncharged ports.</p>

<p>Those enemies of Timon’s and mine own</p>

<p>Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof</p>

<p>Fall, and no more. And to atone your fears</p>

<p>With my more noble meaning, not a man</p>

<p>Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream</p>

<p>Of regular justice in your city’s bounds</p>

<p>But shall be remedied to your public laws</p>

<p>At heaviest answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span>  ’Tis most nobly spoken.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  Descend and keep your words.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Senators descend.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Soldier, with the wax tablet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soldier</span></p>

<p>My noble general, Timon is dead,</p>

<p>Entombed upon the very hem o’ th’ sea,</p>

<p>And on his gravestone this insculpture, which</p>

<p>With wax I brought away, whose soft impression</p>

<p>Interprets for my poor ignorance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span> <i>[reads the epitaph.]</i></p>

<p>Here lies a wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft.</p>

<p>Seek not my name. A plague consume you, wicked</p>

<p>caitiffs left!</p>

<p>Here lie I, Timon, who, alive, all living men did hate.</p>

<p>Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here</p>

<p>thy gait.</p>

<p>These well express in thee thy latter spirits.</p>

<p>Though thou abhorred’st in us our human griefs,</p>

<p>Scorned’st our brains’ flow and those our droplets</p>

<p>which</p>

<p>From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit</p>

<p>Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye</p>

<p>On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead</p>

<p>Is noble Timon, of whose memory</p>

<p>Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,</p>

<p>And I will use the olive with my sword,</p>

<p>Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make</p>

<p>each</p>

<p>Prescribe to other as each other’s leech.</p>

<p>Let our drums strike.</p>

<p><center><i>[Drums. They exit.]</i></center></p>
