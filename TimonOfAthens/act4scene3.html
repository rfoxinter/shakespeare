<p><center><i>[Enter Timon in the woods, with a spade.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>O blessed breeding sun, draw from the Earth</p>

<p>Rotten humidity! Below thy sister’s orb</p>

<p>Infect the air! Twinned brothers of one womb,</p>

<p>Whose procreation, residence, and birth</p>

<p>Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes,</p>

<p>The greater scorns the lesser. Not nature,</p>

<p>To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune</p>

<p>But by contempt of nature.</p>

<p>Raise me this beggar, and deny ’t that lord;</p>

<p>The Senators shall bear contempt hereditary,</p>

<p>The beggar native honor.</p>

<p>It is the pasture lards the brother’s sides,</p>

<p>The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who</p>

<p>dares</p>

<p>In purity of manhood stand upright</p>

<p>And say “This man’s a flatterer”? If one be,</p>

<p>So are they all, for every grise of fortune</p>

<p>Is smoothed by that below. The learned pate</p>

<p>Ducks to the golden fool. All’s obliquy.</p>

<p>There’s nothing level in our cursed natures</p>

<p>But direct villainy. Therefore be abhorred</p>

<p>All feasts, societies, and throngs of men.</p>

<p>His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains.</p>

<p>Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!</p>

<p>Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate</p>

<p>With thy most operant poison! <i>[(Digging, he finds</p>

<p>gold.)]</i> What is here?</p>

<p>Gold? Yellow, glittering, precious gold?</p>

<p>No, gods, I am no idle votarist.</p>

<p>Roots, you clear heavens! Thus much of this will</p>

<p>make</p>

<p>Black white, foul fair, wrong right,</p>

<p>Base noble, old young, coward valiant.</p>

<p>Ha, you gods! Why this? What this, you gods? Why,</p>

<p>this</p>

<p>Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,</p>

<p>Pluck stout men’s pillows from below their heads.</p>

<p>This yellow slave</p>

<p>Will knit and break religions, bless th’ accursed,</p>

<p>Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves</p>

<p>And give them title, knee, and approbation</p>

<p>With senators on the bench. This is it</p>

<p>That makes the wappened widow wed again;</p>

<p>She whom the spital house and ulcerous sores</p>

<p>Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices</p>

<p>To th’ April day again. Come, damned earth,</p>

<p>Thou common whore of mankind, that puts odds</p>

<p>Among the rout of nations, I will make thee</p>

<p>Do thy right nature. <i>[(March afar off.)]</i> Ha? A drum?</p>

<p>Thou ’rt quick,</p>

<p>But yet I’ll bury thee. Thou ’lt go, strong thief,</p>

<p>When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.</p>

<p>Nay, stay thou out for earnest.</p>

<p><center><i>[He buries the gold, keeping some out.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Alcibiades, with Drum and Fife, in warlike</p>

<p>manner, and Phrynia and Timandra.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  What art thou there? Speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart</p>

<p>For showing me again the eyes of man!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee</p>

<p>That art thyself a man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>I am Misanthropos and hate mankind.</p>

<p>For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,</p>

<p>That I might love thee something.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  I know thee well.</p>

<p>But in thy fortunes am unlearned and strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>I know thee too, and more than that I know thee</p>

<p>I not desire to know. Follow thy drum.</p>

<p>With man’s blood paint the ground gules, gules!</p>

<p>Religious canons, civil laws are cruel.</p>

<p>Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine</p>

<p>Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,</p>

<p>For all her cherubin look.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Phrynia</span>  Thy lips rot off!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>I will not kiss thee. Then the rot returns</p>

<p>To thine own lips again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>How came the noble Timon to this change?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>As the moon does, by wanting light to give.</p>

<p>But then renew I could not, like the moon;</p>

<p>There were no suns to borrow of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>Noble Timon, what friendship may I do thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>None, but to maintain my opinion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  What is it, Timon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Promise me friendship, but perform none. If</p>

<p>thou wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for</p>

<p>thou art a man. If thou dost perform, confound</p>

<p>thee, for thou art a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Thou saw’st them when I had prosperity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>I see them now. Then was a blessed time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timandra</span></p>

<p>Is this th’ Athenian minion whom the world</p>

<p>Voiced so regardfully?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Art thou Timandra?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timandra</span>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Be a whore still. They love thee not that use thee.</p>

<p>Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.</p>

<p>Make use of thy salt hours. Season the slaves</p>

<p>For tubs and baths. Bring down rose-cheeked youth</p>

<p>To the tub-fast and the diet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timandra</span>  Hang thee, monster!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>Pardon him, sweet Timandra, for his wits</p>

<p>Are drowned and lost in his calamities.–</p>

<p>I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,</p>

<p>The want whereof doth daily make revolt</p>

<p>In my penurious band. I have heard and grieved</p>

<p>How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,</p>

<p>Forgetting thy great deeds when neighbor states,</p>

<p>But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>I prithee, beat thy drum and get thee gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>I am thy friend and pity thee, dear Timon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?</p>

<p>I had rather be alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>Why, fare thee well. Here is some gold for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Keep it. I cannot eat it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>When I have laid proud Athens on a heap–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Warr’st thou ’gainst Athens?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  Ay, Timon, and have cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>The gods confound them all in thy conquest,</p>

<p>And thee after, when thou hast conquered!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>Why me, Timon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  That by killing of villains</p>

<p>Thou wast born to conquer my country.</p>

<p>Put up thy gold. Go on. Here’s gold. Go on.</p>

<p>Be as a planetary plague when Jove</p>

<p>Will o’er some high-viced city hang his poison</p>

<p>In the sick air. Let not thy sword skip one.</p>

<p>Pity not honored age for his white beard;</p>

<p>He is an usurer. Strike me the counterfeit matron;</p>

<p>It is her habit only that is honest,</p>

<p>Herself’s a bawd. Let not the virgin’s cheek</p>

<p>Make soft thy trenchant sword, for those milk paps,</p>

<p>That through the window-bars bore at men’s eyes,</p>

<p>Are not within the leaf of pity writ,</p>

<p>But set them down horrible traitors. Spare not the</p>

<p>babe,</p>

<p>Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their</p>

<p>mercy;</p>

<p>Think it a bastard whom the oracle</p>

<p>Hath doubtfully pronounced the throat shall cut,</p>

<p>And mince it sans remorse. Swear against objects;</p>

<p>Put armor on thine ears and on thine eyes,</p>

<p>Whose proof nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,</p>

<p>Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,</p>

<p>Shall pierce a jot. <i>[(He offers gold.)]</i> There’s gold to</p>

<p>pay thy soldiers.</p>

<p>Make large confusion and, thy fury spent,</p>

<p>Confounded be thyself! Speak not. Begone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>Hast thou gold yet? I’ll take the gold thou givest me,</p>

<p>Not all thy counsel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Dost thou or dost thou not, heaven’s curse upon thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span> <span class='sc'>Women</span></p>

<p>Give us some gold, good Timon. Hast thou more?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,</p>

<p>And to make whores a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,</p>

<p>Your aprons mountant. <i>[(He begins throwing gold</p>

<p>into their aprons.)]</i> You are not oathable,</p>

<p>Although I know you’ll swear–terribly swear</p>

<p>Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues</p>

<p>Th’ immortal gods that hear you. Spare your oaths.</p>

<p>I’ll trust to your conditions. Be whores still.</p>

<p>And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,</p>

<p>Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up.</p>

<p>Let your close fire predominate his smoke,</p>

<p>And be no turncoats. Yet may your pains six months</p>

<p>Be quite contrary. And thatch your poor thin roofs</p>

<p>With burdens of the dead–some that were hanged,</p>

<p>No matter; wear them, betray with them. Whore</p>

<p>still.</p>

<p>Paint till a horse may mire upon your face.</p>

<p>A pox of wrinkles!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span> <span class='sc'>Women</span>  Well, more gold. What then?</p>

<p>Believe ’t that we’ll do anything for gold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Consumptions sow</p>

<p>In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,</p>

<p>And mar men’s spurring. Crack the lawyer’s voice,</p>

<p>That he may never more false title plead</p>

<p>Nor sound his quillets shrilly. Hoar the flamen,</p>

<p>That scolds against the quality of flesh</p>

<p>And not believes himself. Down with the nose–</p>

<p>Down with it flat, take the bridge quite away–</p>

<p>Of him that, his particular to foresee,</p>

<p>Smells from the general weal. Make curled-pate</p>

<p>ruffians bald,</p>

<p>And let the unscarred braggarts of the war</p>

<p>Derive some pain from you. Plague all,</p>

<p>That your activity may defeat and quell</p>

<p>The source of all erection. There’s more gold.</p>

<p>Do you damn others, and let this damn you,</p>

<p>And ditches grave you all!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span> <span class='sc'>Women</span></p>

<p>More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>More whore, more mischief first! I have given you</p>

<p>earnest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span></p>

<p>Strike up the drum towards Athens.–Farewell,</p>

<p>Timon.</p>

<p>If I thrive well, I’ll visit thee again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>If I hope well, I’ll never see thee more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  I never did thee harm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Yes, thou spok’st well of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span>  Call’st thou that harm?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take</p>

<p>Thy beagles with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Alcibiades</span> <i>[to the Women]</i>  We but offend him.–</p>

<p>Strike.     <i><i>[The drum sounds; all but Timon exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>That nature, being sick of man’s unkindness,</p>

<p>Should yet be hungry! <i>[(He digs.)]</i> Common mother,</p>

<p>thou</p>

<p>Whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast</p>

<p>Teems and feeds all; whose selfsame mettle–</p>

<p>Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puffed–</p>

<p>Engenders the black toad and adder blue,</p>

<p>The gilded newt and eyeless venomed worm,</p>

<p>With all th’ abhorred births below crisp heaven</p>

<p>Whereon Hyperion’s quick’ning fire doth shine:</p>

<p>Yield him who all thy human sons do hate,</p>

<p>From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!</p>

<p>Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb;</p>

<p>Let it no more bring out ingrateful man.</p>

<p>Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;</p>

<p>Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face</p>

<p>Hath to the marbled mansion all above</p>

<p>Never presented. O, a root! Dear thanks!</p>

<p>Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plow-torn leas,</p>

<p>Whereof ingrateful man with liquorish drafts</p>

<p>And morsels unctuous greases his pure mind,</p>

<p>That from it all consideration slips–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Apemantus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>More man? Plague, plague!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>I was directed hither. Men report</p>

<p>Thou dost affect my manners and dost use them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>’Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,</p>

<p>Whom I would imitate. Consumption catch thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>This is in thee a nature but infected,</p>

<p>A poor unmanly melancholy sprung</p>

<p>From change of future. Why this spade? This place?</p>

<p>This slavelike habit and these looks of care?</p>

<p>Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft,</p>

<p>Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot</p>

<p>That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods</p>

<p>By putting on the cunning of a carper.</p>

<p>Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive</p>

<p>By that which has undone thee. Hinge thy knee,</p>

<p>And let his very breath whom thou ’lt observe</p>

<p>Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,</p>

<p>And call it excellent. Thou wast told thus.</p>

<p>Thou gav’st thine ears, like tapsters that bade</p>

<p>welcome,</p>

<p>To knaves and all approachers. ’Tis most just</p>

<p>That thou turn rascal. Had’st thou wealth again,</p>

<p>Rascals should have ’t. Do not assume my likeness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Were I like thee, I’d throw away myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself–</p>

<p>A madman so long, now a fool. What, think’st</p>

<p>That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,</p>

<p>Will put thy shirt on warm? Will these moist trees,</p>

<p>That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels</p>

<p>And skip when thou point’st out? Will the cold brook,</p>

<p>Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste</p>

<p>To cure thy o’ernight’s surfeit? Call the creatures</p>

<p>Whose naked natures live in all the spite</p>

<p>Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,</p>

<p>To the conflicting elements exposed,</p>

<p>Answer mere nature. Bid them flatter thee.</p>

<p>O, thou shalt find–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  A fool of thee. Depart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>I love thee better now than e’er I did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>I hate thee worse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Why?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Thou flatter’st misery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>I flatter not but say thou art a caitiff.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Why dost thou seek me out?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  To vex thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Always a villain’s office or a fool’s.</p>

<p>Dost please thyself in ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  What, a knave too?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>If thou didst put this sour cold habit on</p>

<p>To castigate thy pride, ’twere well, but thou</p>

<p>Dost it enforcedly. Thou ’dst courtier be again</p>

<p>Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery</p>

<p>Outlives incertain pomp, is crowned before;</p>

<p>The one is filling still, never complete,</p>

<p>The other at high wish. Best state, contentless,</p>

<p>Hath a distracted and most wretched being,</p>

<p>Worse than the worst, content.</p>

<p>Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Not by his breath that is more miserable.</p>

<p>Thou art a slave whom Fortune’s tender arm</p>

<p>With favor never clasped but bred a dog.</p>

<p>Hadst thou, like us from our first swathe, proceeded</p>

<p>The sweet degrees that this brief world affords</p>

<p>To such as may the passive drugs of it</p>

<p>Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged</p>

<p>thyself</p>

<p>In general riot, melted down thy youth</p>

<p>In different beds of lust, and never learned</p>

<p>The icy precepts of respect, but followed</p>

<p>The sugared game before thee. But myself–</p>

<p>Who had the world as my confectionary,</p>

<p>The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of</p>

<p>men</p>

<p>At duty, more than I could frame employment,</p>

<p>That numberless upon me stuck as leaves</p>

<p>Do on the oak, have with one winter’s brush</p>

<p>Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare,</p>

<p>For every storm that blows–I to bear this,</p>

<p>That never knew but better, is some burden.</p>

<p>Thy nature did commence in sufferance. Time</p>

<p>Hath made thee hard in ’t. Why shouldst thou hate</p>

<p>men?</p>

<p>They never flattered thee. What hast thou given?</p>

<p>If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,</p>

<p>Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff</p>

<p>To some she-beggar and compounded thee</p>

<p>Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, begone.</p>

<p>If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,</p>

<p>Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>Art thou proud yet?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Ay, that I am not thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  I, that I was no prodigal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  I, that I am one now.</p>

<p>Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,</p>

<p>I’d give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.</p>

<p>That the whole life of Athens were in this!</p>

<p>Thus would I eat it.     <i><i>[He gnaws a root.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span> <i>[offering food]</i>  Here, I will mend thy feast.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>First mend my company. Take away thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>So I shall mend mine own by th’ lack of thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>’Tis not well mended so; it is but botched.</p>

<p>If not, I would it were.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  What wouldst thou have to Athens?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,</p>

<p>Tell them there I have gold. Look, so I have.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>Here is no use for gold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  The best and truest,</p>

<p>For here it sleeps and does no hired harm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Where liest a-nights, Timon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Under that’s above me. Where feed’st thou</p>

<p>a-days, Apemantus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Where my stomach finds meat, or rather</p>

<p>where I eat it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Would poison were obedient and knew my</p>

<p>mind!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Where wouldst thou send it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  To sauce thy dishes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  The middle of humanity thou never</p>

<p>knewest, but the extremity of both ends. When</p>

<p>thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume, they</p>

<p>mocked thee for too much curiosity. In thy rags</p>

<p>thou know’st none, but art despised for the contrary.</p>

<p>There’s a medlar for thee. Eat it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  On what I hate I feed not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Dost hate a medlar?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Ay, though it look like thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  An thou ’dst hated meddlers sooner, thou</p>

<p>shouldst have loved thyself better now. What man</p>

<p>didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved</p>

<p>after his means?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Who, without those means thou talk’st of, didst</p>

<p>thou ever know beloved?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  I understand thee. Thou hadst some means to</p>

<p>keep a dog.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  What things in the world canst thou nearest</p>

<p>compare to thy flatterers?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Women nearest, but men–men are the things</p>

<p>themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,</p>

<p>Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion</p>

<p>of men and remain a beast with the beasts?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Ay, Timon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee</p>

<p>t’ attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would</p>

<p>beguile thee. If thou wert the lamb, the fox would</p>

<p>eat thee. If thou wert the fox, the lion would suspect</p>

<p>thee when peradventure thou wert accused by</p>

<p>the ass. If thou wert the ass, thy dullness would</p>

<p>torment thee, and still thou lived’st but as a breakfast</p>

<p>to the wolf. If thou wert the wolf, thy greediness</p>

<p>would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst hazard</p>

<p>thy life for thy dinner. Wert thou the unicorn,</p>

<p>pride and wrath would confound thee and</p>

<p>make thine own self the conquest of thy fury. Wert</p>

<p>thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse.</p>

<p>Wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the</p>

<p>leopard. Wert thou a leopard, thou wert germane</p>

<p>to the lion, and the spots of thy kindred were</p>

<p>jurors on thy life. All thy safety were remotion, and</p>

<p>thy defense absence. What beast couldst thou be</p>

<p>that were not subject to a beast? And what a beast</p>

<p>art thou already that seest not thy loss in</p>

<p>transformation!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  If thou couldst please me with speaking to</p>

<p>me, thou mightst have hit upon it here. The commonwealth</p>

<p>of Athens is become a forest of beasts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  How, has the ass broke the wall that thou art</p>

<p>out of the city?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Yonder comes a poet and a painter. The</p>

<p>plague of company light upon thee! I will fear to</p>

<p>catch it and give way. When I know not what else</p>

<p>to do, I’ll see thee again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  When there is nothing living but thee, thou</p>

<p>shalt be welcome. I had rather be a beggar’s dog</p>

<p>than Apemantus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>A plague on thee! Thou art too bad to curse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>All villains that do stand by thee are pure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>There is no leprosy but what thou speak’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  If I name thee.</p>

<p>I’ll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  I would my tongue could rot them off!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!</p>

<p>Choler does kill me that thou art alive.</p>

<p>I swoon to see thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>Would thou wouldst burst!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Away, thou tedious rogue!</p>

<p>I am sorry I shall lose a stone by thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[Timon throws a stone at Apemantus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Beast!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Slave!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Toad!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Rogue, rogue, rogue!</p>

<p>I am sick of this false world, and will love nought</p>

<p>But even the mere necessities upon ’t.</p>

<p>Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave.</p>

<p>Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat</p>

<p>Thy gravestone daily. Make thine epitaph,</p>

<p>That death in me at others’ lives may laugh.</p>

<p><i>[(To his gold.)]</i> O thou sweet king-killer and dear</p>

<p>divorce</p>

<p>’Twixt natural son and sire, thou bright defiler</p>

<p>Of Hymen’s purest bed, thou valiant Mars,</p>

<p>Thou ever young, fresh, loved, and delicate wooer,</p>

<p>Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow</p>

<p>That lies on Dian’s lap; thou visible god,</p>

<p>That sold’rest close impossibilities</p>

<p>And mak’st them kiss, that speak’st with every</p>

<p>tongue</p>

<p>To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts,</p>

<p>Think thy slave, man, rebels, and by thy virtue</p>

<p>Set them into confounding odds, that beasts</p>

<p>May have the world in empire!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Would ’twere so!</p>

<p>But not till I am dead. I’ll say thou ’st gold;</p>

<p>Thou wilt be thronged to shortly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Thronged to?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Thy back, I prithee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span>  Live and love thy misery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Long live so, and so die. I am quit.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Banditti.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Apemantus</span></p>

<p>More things like men.–Eat, Timon, and abhor</p>

<p>them.     <i><i>[Apemantus exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Bandit</span>  Where should he have this gold? It is</p>

<p>some poor fragment, some slender ort of his</p>

<p>remainder. The mere want of gold and the falling-from</p>

<p>of his friends drove him into this melancholy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Bandit</span>  It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Bandit</span>  Let us make the assay upon him. If he</p>

<p>care not for ’t, he will supply us easily. If he covetously</p>

<p>reserve it, how shall ’s get it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Bandit</span>  True, for he bears it not about him. ’Tis</p>

<p>hid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Bandit</span>  Is not this he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Others</span>  Where?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Bandit</span>  ’Tis his description.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Bandit</span>  He. I know him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  Save thee, Timon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Now, thieves?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span></p>

<p>Soldiers, not thieves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Both, too, and women’s sons.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span></p>

<p>We are not thieves, but men that much do want.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.</p>

<p>Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots.</p>

<p>Within this mile break forth a hundred springs.</p>

<p>The oaks bear mast, the briars scarlet hips.</p>

<p>The bounteous huswife Nature on each bush</p>

<p>Lays her full mess before you. Want? Why want?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Bandit</span></p>

<p>We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,</p>

<p>As beasts and birds and fishes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds and fishes;</p>

<p>You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con</p>

<p>That you are thieves professed, that you work not</p>

<p>In holier shapes, for there is boundless theft</p>

<p>In limited professions. Rascal thieves,</p>

<p>Here’s gold. <i>[(He gives them gold.)]</i> Go, suck the</p>

<p>subtle blood o’ th’ grape</p>

<p>Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,</p>

<p>And so ’scape hanging. Trust not the physician;</p>

<p>His antidotes are poison, and he slays</p>

<p>More than you rob. Take wealth and lives together.</p>

<p>Do, villainy, do, since you protest to do ’t,</p>

<p>Like workmen. I’ll example you with thievery.</p>

<p>The sun’s a thief and with his great attraction</p>

<p>Robs the vast sea. The moon’s an arrant thief,</p>

<p>And her pale fire she snatches from the sun.</p>

<p>The sea’s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves</p>

<p>The moon into salt tears. The earth’s a thief,</p>

<p>That feeds and breeds by a composture stol’n</p>

<p>From gen’ral excrement. Each thing’s a thief.</p>

<p>The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power</p>

<p>Has unchecked theft. Love not yourselves. Away!</p>

<p>Rob one another. There’s more gold. <i>[(He gives them</p>

<p>gold.)]</i> Cut throats.</p>

<p>All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go.</p>

<p>Break open shops. Nothing can you steal</p>

<p>But thieves do lose it. Steal less for this I give you,</p>

<p>And gold confound you howsoe’er! Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Bandit</span>  Has almost charmed me from my profession</p>

<p>by persuading me to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Bandit</span>  ’Tis in the malice of mankind that he</p>

<p>thus advises us, not to have us thrive in our</p>

<p>mystery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Bandit</span>  I’ll believe him as an enemy and give</p>

<p>over my trade.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Bandit</span>  Let us first see peace in Athens. There is</p>

<p>no time so miserable but a man may be true.</p>

<p><center><i>[Thieves exit.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Enter Flavius the Steward, to Timon.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span>  O you gods!</p>

<p>Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?</p>

<p>Full of decay and flailing? O, monument</p>

<p>And wonder of good deeds evilly bestowed!</p>

<p>What an alteration of honor has desp’rate want</p>

<p>made!</p>

<p>What viler thing upon the Earth than friends,</p>

<p>Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!</p>

<p>How rarely does it meet with this time’s guise,</p>

<p>When man was wished to love his enemies!</p>

<p>Grant I may ever love, and rather woo</p>

<p>Those that would mischief me than those that do!</p>

<p>Has caught me in his eye. I will present</p>

<p>My honest grief unto him and as my lord</p>

<p>Still serve him with my life.–My dearest master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Away! What art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span>  Have you forgot me, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men.</p>

<p>Then, if thou grant’st thou ’rt a man, I have forgot</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span>  An honest poor servant of yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Then I know thee not.</p>

<p>I never had honest man about me, I. All</p>

<p>I kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span>  The gods are witness,</p>

<p>Ne’er did poor steward wear a truer grief</p>

<p>For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He weeps.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>What, dost thou weep? Come nearer, then. I love</p>

<p>thee</p>

<p>Because thou art a woman and disclaim’st</p>

<p>Flinty mankind, whose eyes do never give</p>

<p>But thorough lust and laughter. Pity’s sleeping.</p>

<p>Strange times that weep with laughing, not with</p>

<p>weeping!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span></p>

<p>I beg of you to know me, good my lord,</p>

<p>T’ accept my grief, and, whilst this poor wealth lasts,</p>

<p>To entertain me as your steward still.</p>

<p><center><i>[He offers money.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  Had I a steward</p>

<p>So true, so just, and now so comfortable?</p>

<p>It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.</p>

<p>Let me behold thy face. Surely this man</p>

<p>Was born of woman.</p>

<p>Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,</p>

<p>You perpetual-sober gods. I do proclaim</p>

<p>One honest man–mistake me not, but one;</p>

<p>No more, I pray!–and he’s a steward.</p>

<p>How fain would I have hated all mankind,</p>

<p>And thou redeem’st thyself. But all, save thee,</p>

<p>I fell with curses.</p>

<p>Methinks thou art more honest now than wise,</p>

<p>For by oppressing and betraying me</p>

<p>Thou mightst have sooner got another service;</p>

<p>For many so arrive at second masters</p>

<p>Upon their first lord’s neck. But tell me true–</p>

<p>For I must ever doubt, though ne’er so sure–</p>

<p>Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,</p>

<p>A usuring kindness, and as rich men deal gifts,</p>

<p>Expecting in return twenty for one?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span></p>

<p>No, my most worthy master, in whose breast</p>

<p>Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late.</p>

<p>You should have feared false times when you did</p>

<p>feast.</p>

<p>Suspect still comes where an estate is least.</p>

<p>That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,</p>

<p>Duty, and zeal to your unmatched mind,</p>

<p>Care of your food and living. And believe it,</p>

<p>My most honored lord,</p>

<p>For any benefit that points to me,</p>

<p>Either in hope or present, I’d exchange</p>

<p>For this one wish, that you had power and wealth</p>

<p>To requite me by making rich yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Look thee, ’tis so. Thou singly honest man,</p>

<p>Here, take. <i>[(Timon offers gold.)]</i> The gods out of my</p>

<p>misery</p>

<p>Has sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy,</p>

<p>But thus conditioned: thou shalt build from men;</p>

<p>Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,</p>

<p>But let the famished flesh slide from the bone</p>

<p>Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs</p>

<p>What thou deniest to men; let prisons swallow ’em,</p>

<p>Debts wither ’em to nothing; be men like blasted</p>

<p>woods,</p>

<p>And may diseases lick up their false bloods!</p>

<p>And so farewell and thrive.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Flavius</span>  O, let me stay</p>

<p>And comfort you, my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span>  If thou hat’st curses,</p>

<p>Stay not. Fly whilst thou art blest and free.</p>

<p>Ne’er see thou man, and let me ne’er see thee.</p>
