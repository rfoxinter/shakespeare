<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius, with three Strangers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good</p>

<p>friend and an honorable gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Stranger</span>  We know him for no less, though we</p>

<p>are but strangers to him. But I can tell you one</p>

<p>thing, my lord, and which I hear from common</p>

<p>rumors: now Lord Timon’s happy hours are done</p>

<p>and past, and his estate shrinks from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  Fie, no, do not believe it. He cannot want for</p>

<p>money.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Stranger</span>  But believe you this, my lord, that</p>

<p>not long ago one of his men was with the Lord</p>

<p>Lucullus to borrow fifty talents, nay, urged</p>

<p>extremely for ’t, and showed what necessity</p>

<p>belonged to ’t, and yet was denied.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  How?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Stranger</span>  I tell you, denied, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  What a strange case was that! Now, before the</p>

<p>gods, I am ashamed on ’t. Denied that honorable</p>

<p>man? There was very little honor showed in ’t. For</p>

<p>my own part, I must needs confess I have received</p>

<p>some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate,</p>

<p>jewels, and suchlike trifles, nothing comparing to</p>

<p>his; yet had he mistook him and sent to me, I</p>

<p>should ne’er have denied his occasion fifty talents.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servilius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servilius</span> <i>[aside]</i>  See, by good hap, yonder’s my lord.</p>

<p>I have sweat to see his Honor. <i>[To Lucius.]</i> My</p>

<p>honored lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  Servilius. You are kindly met, sir. Fare thee</p>

<p>well. Commend me to thy honorable virtuous lord,</p>

<p>my very exquisite friend.     <i><i>[He turns to exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servilius</span>  May it please your Honor, my lord hath</p>

<p>sent–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  Ha! What has he sent? I am so much endeared</p>

<p>to that lord; he’s ever sending. How shall I thank</p>

<p>him, think’st thou? And what has he sent now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servilius</span>  Has only sent his present occasion now, my</p>

<p>lord, requesting your Lordship to supply his</p>

<p>instant use with fifty talents.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>I know his Lordship is but merry with me.</p>

<p>He cannot want fifty-five hundred talents.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servilius</span></p>

<p>But in the meantime he wants less, my lord.</p>

<p>If his occasion were not virtuous,</p>

<p>I should not urge it half so faithfully.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servilius</span>  Upon my soul, ’tis true, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish</p>

<p>myself against such a good time, when I might ha’</p>

<p>shown myself honorable! How unluckily it happened</p>

<p>that I should purchase the day before for a</p>

<p>little part, and undo a great deal of honor! Servilius,</p>

<p>now before the gods, I am not able to do–the</p>

<p>more beast, I say!–I was sending to use Lord</p>

<p>Timon myself, these gentlemen can witness; but I</p>

<p>would not for the wealth of Athens I had done ’t</p>

<p>now. Commend me bountifully to his good Lordship,</p>

<p>and I hope his Honor will conceive the fairest</p>

<p>of me, because I have no power to be kind. And tell</p>

<p>him this from me: I count it one of my greatest</p>

<p>afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an honorable</p>

<p>gentleman. Good Servilius, will you</p>

<p>befriend me so far as to use mine own words to</p>

<p>him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servilius</span>  Yes, sir, I shall.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  I’ll look you out a good turn, Servilius.</p>

<p><center><i>[Servilius exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>True, as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed,</p>

<p>And he that’s once denied will hardly speed.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Stranger</span>  Do you observe this, Hostilius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Stranger</span>  Ay, too well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Stranger</span></p>

<p>Why, this is the world’s soul, and just of the same</p>

<p>piece</p>

<p>Is every flatterer’s sport. Who can call him his friend</p>

<p>That dips in the same dish? For, in my knowing,</p>

<p>Timon has been this lord’s father</p>

<p>And kept his credit with his purse,</p>

<p>Supported his estate, nay, Timon’s money</p>

<p>Has paid his men their wages. He ne’er drinks</p>

<p>But Timon’s silver treads upon his lip.</p>

<p>And yet–O, see the monstrousness of man</p>

<p>When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!–</p>

<p>He does deny him, in respect of his,</p>

<p>What charitable men afford to beggars.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Stranger</span></p>

<p>Religion groans at it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Stranger</span>  For mine own part,</p>

<p>I never tasted Timon in my life,</p>

<p>Nor came any of his bounties over me</p>

<p>To mark me for his friend. Yet I protest,</p>

<p>For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue,</p>

<p>And honorable carriage,</p>

<p>Had his necessity made use of me,</p>

<p>I would have put my wealth into donation,</p>

<p>And the best half should have returned to him,</p>

<p>So much I love his heart. But I perceive</p>

<p>Men must learn now with pity to dispense,</p>

<p>For policy sits above conscience.</p>
