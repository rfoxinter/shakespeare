<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Timon</span></p>

<p>Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall</p>

<p>That girdles in those wolves, dive in the earth</p>

<p>And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!</p>

<p>Obedience fail in children! Slaves and fools,</p>

<p>Pluck the grave wrinkled Senate from the bench</p>

<p>And minister in their steads! To general filths</p>

<p>Convert o’ th’ instant, green virginity!</p>

<p>Do ’t in your parents’ eyes! Bankrupts, hold fast!</p>

<p>Rather than render back, out with your knives</p>

<p>And cut your trusters’ throats! Bound servants, steal!</p>

<p>Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,</p>

<p>And pill by law. Maid, to thy master’s bed!</p>

<p>Thy mistress is o’ th’ brothel. Son of sixteen,</p>

<p>Pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire;</p>

<p>With it beat out his brains! Piety and fear,</p>

<p>Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,</p>

<p>Domestic awe, night rest, and neighborhood,</p>

<p>Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,</p>

<p>Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,</p>

<p>Decline to your confounding contraries,</p>

<p>And yet confusion live! Plagues incident to men,</p>

<p>Your potent and infectious fevers heap</p>

<p>On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,</p>

<p>Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt</p>

<p>As lamely as their manners! Lust and liberty,</p>

<p>Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,</p>

<p>That ’gainst the stream of virtue they may strive</p>

<p>And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,</p>

<p>Sow all th’ Athenian bosoms, and their crop</p>

<p>Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,</p>

<p>That their society, as their friendship, may</p>

<p>Be merely poison! Nothing I’ll bear from thee</p>

<p>But nakedness, thou detestable town!</p>

<p>Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!</p>

<p>Timon will to the woods, where he shall find</p>

<p>Th’ unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.</p>

<p>The gods confound–hear me, you good gods all!–</p>

<p>Th’ Athenians both within and out that wall,</p>

<p>And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow</p>

<p>To the whole race of mankind, high and low!</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
