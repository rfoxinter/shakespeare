<p><center><i>[Enter Flaminius waiting to speak with Lucullus,</p>

<p>from his master.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant to him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  I have told my lord of you. He is coming</p>

<p>down to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flaminius</sc>  I thank you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucullus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  Here’s my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucullus</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  One of Lord Timon’s men? A gift, I</p>

<p>warrant. Why, this hits right. I dreamt of a silver</p>

<p>basin and ewer tonight.–Flaminius, honest</p>

<p>Flaminius, you are very respectively welcome, sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[(To Servant.)]</i></center> Fill me some wine.     <i><center><i>[(Servant exits.)]</i></center></i></p>

<p>And how does that honorable, complete, free-hearted</p>

<p>gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful</p>

<p>good lord and master?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flaminius</sc>  His health is well, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucullus</sc>  I am right glad that his health is well, sir.</p>

<p>And what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty</p>

<p>Flaminius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flaminius</sc>  Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which</p>

<p>in my lord’s behalf I come to entreat your Honor</p>

<p>to supply; who, having great and instant occasion</p>

<p>to use fifty talents, hath sent to your Lordship to</p>

<p>furnish him, nothing doubting your present assistance</p>

<p>therein.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucullus</sc>  La, la, la, la. “Nothing doubting” says he?</p>

<p>Alas, good lord! A noble gentleman ’tis, if he would</p>

<p>not keep so good a house. Many a time and often I</p>

<p>ha’ dined with him and told him on ’t, and come</p>

<p>again to supper to him of purpose to have him</p>

<p>spend less, and yet he would embrace no counsel,</p>

<p>take no warning by my coming. Every man has his</p>

<p>fault, and honesty is his. I ha’ told him on ’t, but I</p>

<p>could ne’er get him from ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servant with wine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  Please your Lordship, here is the wine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucullus</sc>  Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise.</p>

<p>Here’s to thee.     <i><i>[He drinks.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flaminius</sc>  Your Lordship speaks your pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucullus</sc>  I have observed thee always for a towardly</p>

<p>prompt spirit–give thee thy due–and one that</p>

<p>knows what belongs to reason and canst use the</p>

<p>time well, if the time use thee well. Good parts in</p>

<p>thee.–Get you gone, sirrah.     <i><i>[Servant exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord’s a bountiful</p>

<p>gentleman, but thou art wise and thou</p>

<p>know’st well enough, although thou com’st to me,</p>

<p>that this is no time to lend money, especially upon</p>

<p>bare friendship, without security. Here’s three solidares</p>

<p>for thee. <i>[(Gives him money.)]</i> Good boy,</p>

<p>wink at me, and say thou saw’st me not. Fare thee</p>

<p>well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flaminius</sc></p>

<p>Is ’t possible the world should so much differ,</p>

<p>And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,</p>

<p>To him that worships thee!</p>

<p><center><i>[He throws the money back at Lucullus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucullus</sc>  Ha! Now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy</p>

<p>master.     <i><i>[Lucullus exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flaminius</sc></p>

<p>May these add to the number that may scald thee!</p>

<p>Let molten coin be thy damnation,</p>

<p>Thou disease of a friend and not himself!</p>

<p>Has friendship such a faint and milky heart</p>

<p>It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,</p>

<p>I feel my master’s passion. This slave</p>

<p>Unto his honor has my lord’s meat in him.</p>

<p>Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment</p>

<p>When he is turned to poison?</p>

<p>O, may diseases only work upon ’t,</p>

<p>And when he’s sick to death, let not that part of</p>

<p>nature</p>

<p>Which my lord paid for be of any power</p>

<p>To expel sickness, but prolong his hour.</p>
