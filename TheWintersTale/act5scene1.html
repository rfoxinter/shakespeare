<p><center><i>[Enter Leontes, Cleomenes, Dion, Paulina, and</p>

<p>Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleomenes</sc></p>

<p>Sir, you have done enough, and have performed</p>

<p>A saintlike sorrow. No fault could you make</p>

<p>Which you have not redeemed–indeed, paid down</p>

<p>More penitence than done trespass. At the last,</p>

<p>Do as the heavens have done: forget your evil;</p>

<p>With them forgive yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Whilst I remember</p>

<p>Her and her virtues, I cannot forget</p>

<p>My blemishes in them, and so still think of</p>

<p>The wrong I did myself, which was so much</p>

<p>That heirless it hath made my kingdom and</p>

<p>Destroyed the sweet’st companion that e’er man</p>

<p>Bred his hopes out of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  True, too true, my lord.</p>

<p>If one by one you wedded all the world,</p>

<p>Or from the all that are took something good</p>

<p>To make a perfect woman, she you killed</p>

<p>Would be unparalleled.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  I think so. Killed?</p>

<p>She I killed? I did so, but thou strik’st me</p>

<p>Sorely to say I did. It is as bitter</p>

<p>Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now,</p>

<p>Say so but seldom.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleomenes</sc>  Not at all, good lady.</p>

<p>You might have spoken a thousand things that</p>

<p>would</p>

<p>Have done the time more benefit and graced</p>

<p>Your kindness better.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  You are one of those</p>

<p>Would have him wed again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dion</sc>  If you would not so,</p>

<p>You pity not the state nor the remembrance</p>

<p>Of his most sovereign name, consider little</p>

<p>What dangers by his Highness’ fail of issue</p>

<p>May drop upon his kingdom and devour</p>

<p>Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy</p>

<p>Than to rejoice the former queen is well?</p>

<p>What holier than, for royalty’s repair,</p>

<p>For present comfort, and for future good,</p>

<p>To bless the bed of majesty again</p>

<p>With a sweet fellow to ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  There is none worthy,</p>

<p>Respecting her that’s gone. Besides, the gods</p>

<p>Will have fulfilled their secret purposes.</p>

<p>For has not the divine Apollo said,</p>

<p>Is ’t not the tenor of his oracle,</p>

<p>That King Leontes shall not have an heir</p>

<p>Till his lost child be found? Which that it shall</p>

<p>Is all as monstrous to our human reason</p>

<p>As my Antigonus to break his grave</p>

<p>And come again to me–who, on my life,</p>

<p>Did perish with the infant. ’Tis your counsel</p>

<p>My lord should to the heavens be contrary,</p>

<p>Oppose against their wills. Care not for issue.</p>

<p>The crown will find an heir. Great Alexander</p>

<p>Left his to th’ worthiest; so his successor</p>

<p>Was like to be the best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Good Paulina,</p>

<p>Who hast the memory of Hermione,</p>

<p>I know, in honor, O, that ever I</p>

<p>Had squared me to thy counsel! Then even now</p>

<p>I might have looked upon my queen’s full eyes,</p>

<p>Have taken treasure from her lips–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  And left them</p>

<p>More rich for what they yielded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Thou speak’st truth.</p>

<p>No more such wives, therefore no wife. One worse,</p>

<p>And better used, would make her sainted spirit</p>

<p>Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,</p>

<p>Where we offenders now appear, soul-vexed,</p>

<p>And begin “Why to me?”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  Had she such power,</p>

<p>She had just cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  She had, and would incense me</p>

<p>To murder her I married.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  I should so.</p>

<p>Were I the ghost that walked, I’d bid you mark</p>

<p>Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in ’t</p>

<p>You chose her. Then I’d shriek, that even your ears</p>

<p>Should rift to hear me, and the words that followed</p>

<p>Should be “Remember mine.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Stars, stars,</p>

<p>And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;</p>

<p>I’ll have no wife, Paulina.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  Will you swear</p>

<p>Never to marry but by my free leave?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc></p>

<p>Never, Paulina, so be blest my spirit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc></p>

<p>Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleomenes</sc></p>

<p>You tempt him over-much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  Unless another</p>

<p>As like Hermione as is her picture</p>

<p>Affront his eye.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cleomenes</sc>  Good madam–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  I have done.</p>

<p>Yet if my lord will marry–if you will, sir,</p>

<p>No remedy but you will–give me the office</p>

<p>To choose you a queen. She shall not be so young</p>

<p>As was your former, but she shall be such</p>

<p>As, walked your first queen’s ghost, it should take</p>

<p>joy</p>

<p>To see her in your arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  My true Paulina,</p>

<p>We shall not marry till thou bid’st us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  That</p>

<p>Shall be when your first queen’s again in breath,</p>

<p>Never till then.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>One that gives out himself Prince Florizell,</p>

<p>Son of Polixenes, with his princess–she</p>

<p>The fairest I have yet beheld–desires access</p>

<p>To your high presence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  What with him? He comes not</p>

<p>Like to his father’s greatness. His approach,</p>

<p>So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us</p>

<p>’Tis not a visitation framed, but forced</p>

<p>By need and accident. What train?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  But few,</p>

<p>And those but mean.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  His princess, say you, with him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,</p>

<p>That e’er the sun shone bright on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  O Hermione,</p>

<p>As every present time doth boast itself</p>

<p>Above a better gone, so must thy grave</p>

<p>Give way to what’s seen now. <i>[To Servant.]</i> Sir, you</p>

<p>yourself</p>

<p>Have said and writ so–but your writing now</p>

<p>Is colder than that theme–she had not been</p>

<p>Nor was not to be equalled. Thus your verse</p>

<p>Flowed with her beauty once. ’Tis shrewdly ebbed</p>

<p>To say you have seen a better.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  Pardon, madam.</p>

<p>The one I have almost forgot–your pardon;</p>

<p>The other, when she has obtained your eye,</p>

<p>Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,</p>

<p>Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal</p>

<p>Of all professors else, make proselytes</p>

<p>Of who she but bid follow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  How, not women?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>Women will love her that she is a woman</p>

<p>More worth than any man; men, that she is</p>

<p>The rarest of all women.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Go, Cleomenes.</p>

<p>Yourself, assisted with your honored friends,</p>

<p>Bring them to our embracement.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cleomenes and others exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Still, ’tis strange</p>

<p>He thus should steal upon us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  Had our prince,</p>

<p>Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had paired</p>

<p>Well with this lord. There was not full a month</p>

<p>Between their births.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Prithee, no more; cease. Thou</p>

<p>know’st</p>

<p>He dies to me again when talked of. Sure,</p>

<p>When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches</p>

<p>Will bring me to consider that which may</p>

<p>Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Florizell, Perdita, Cleomenes, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince,</p>

<p>For she did print your royal father off,</p>

<p>Conceiving you. Were I but twenty-one,</p>

<p>Your father’s image is so hit in you,</p>

<p>His very air, that I should call you brother,</p>

<p>As I did him, and speak of something wildly</p>

<p>By us performed before. Most dearly welcome,</p>

<p>And your fair princess–goddess! O, alas,</p>

<p>I lost a couple that ’twixt heaven and Earth</p>

<p>Might thus have stood, begetting wonder, as</p>

<p>You, gracious couple, do. And then I lost–</p>

<p>All mine own folly–the society,</p>

<p>Amity too, of your brave father, whom,</p>

<p>Though bearing misery, I desire my life</p>

<p>Once more to look on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  By his command</p>

<p>Have I here touched Sicilia, and from him</p>

<p>Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,</p>

<p>Can send his brother. And but infirmity,</p>

<p>Which waits upon worn times, hath something</p>

<p>seized</p>

<p>His wished ability, he had himself</p>

<p>The lands and waters ’twixt your throne and his</p>

<p>Measured to look upon you, whom he loves–</p>

<p>He bade me say so–more than all the scepters</p>

<p>And those that bear them living.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  O my brother,</p>

<p>Good gentleman, the wrongs I have done thee stir</p>

<p>Afresh within me, and these thy offices,</p>

<p>So rarely kind, are as interpreters</p>

<p>Of my behindhand slackness. Welcome hither,</p>

<p>As is the spring to th’ earth. And hath he too</p>

<p>Exposed this paragon to th’ fearful usage,</p>

<p>At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,</p>

<p>To greet a man not worth her pains, much less</p>

<p>Th’ adventure of her person?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Good my lord,</p>

<p>She came from Libya.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Where the warlike Smalus,</p>

<p>That noble honored lord, is feared and loved?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc></p>

<p>Most royal sir, from thence, from him, whose</p>

<p>daughter</p>

<p>His tears proclaimed his, parting with her. Thence,</p>

<p>A prosperous south wind friendly, we have crossed</p>

<p>To execute the charge my father gave me</p>

<p>For visiting your Highness. My best train</p>

<p>I have from your Sicilian shores dismissed,</p>

<p>Who for Bohemia bend, to signify</p>

<p>Not only my success in Libya, sir,</p>

<p>But my arrival and my wife’s in safety</p>

<p>Here where we are.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  The blessed gods</p>

<p>Purge all infection from our air whilst you</p>

<p>Do climate here! You have a holy father,</p>

<p>A graceful gentleman, against whose person,</p>

<p>So sacred as it is, I have done sin,</p>

<p>For which the heavens, taking angry note,</p>

<p>Have left me issueless. And your father’s blest,</p>

<p>As he from heaven merits it, with you,</p>

<p>Worthy his goodness. What might I have been</p>

<p>Might I a son and daughter now have looked on,</p>

<p>Such goodly things as you?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Lord.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  Most noble sir,</p>

<p>That which I shall report will bear no credit,</p>

<p>Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,</p>

<p>Bohemia greets you from himself by me,</p>

<p>Desires you to attach his son, who has–</p>

<p>His dignity and duty both cast off–</p>

<p>Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with</p>

<p>A shepherd’s daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Where’s Bohemia? Speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Here in your city. I now came from him.</p>

<p>I speak amazedly, and it becomes</p>

<p>My marvel and my message. To your court</p>

<p>Whiles he was hast’ning–in the chase, it seems,</p>

<p>Of this fair couple–meets he on the way</p>

<p>The father of this seeming lady and</p>

<p>Her brother, having both their country quitted</p>

<p>With this young prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Camillo has betrayed me,</p>

<p>Whose honor and whose honesty till now</p>

<p>Endured all weathers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  Lay ’t so to his charge.</p>

<p>He’s with the King your father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Who? Camillo?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Camillo, sir. I spake with him, who now</p>

<p>Has these poor men in question. Never saw I</p>

<p>Wretches so quake. They kneel, they kiss the earth,</p>

<p>Forswear themselves as often as they speak.</p>

<p>Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them</p>

<p>With divers deaths in death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  O my poor father!</p>

<p>The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have</p>

<p>Our contract celebrated.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  You are married?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc></p>

<p>We are not, sir, nor are we like to be.</p>

<p>The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first.</p>

<p>The odds for high and low’s alike.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  My lord,</p>

<p>Is this the daughter of a king?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  She is</p>

<p>When once she is my wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc></p>

<p>That “once,” I see, by your good father’s speed</p>

<p>Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,</p>

<p>Most sorry, you have broken from his liking,</p>

<p>Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry</p>

<p>Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,</p>

<p>That you might well enjoy her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc> <i>[to Perdita]</i>  Dear, look up.</p>

<p>Though Fortune, visible an enemy,</p>

<p>Should chase us with my father, power no jot</p>

<p>Hath she to change our loves.–Beseech you, sir,</p>

<p>Remember since you owed no more to time</p>

<p>Than I do now. With thought of such affections,</p>

<p>Step forth mine advocate. At your request,</p>

<p>My father will grant precious things as trifles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc></p>

<p>Would he do so, I’d beg your precious mistress,</p>

<p>Which he counts but a trifle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  Sir, my liege,</p>

<p>Your eye hath too much youth in ’t. Not a month</p>

<p>’Fore your queen died, she was more worth such</p>

<p>gazes</p>

<p>Than what you look on now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  I thought of her</p>

<p>Even in these looks I made. <i>[To Florizell.]</i> But your</p>

<p>petition</p>

<p>Is yet unanswered. I will to your father.</p>

<p>Your honor not o’erthrown by your desires,</p>

<p>I am friend to them and you. Upon which errand</p>

<p>I now go toward him. Therefore follow me,</p>

<p>And mark what way I make. Come, good my lord.</p>
