<p><center><i>[Enter Leontes, Polixenes, Florizell, Perdita, Camillo,</p>

<p>Paulina, and Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort</p>

<p>That I have had of thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  What, sovereign sir,</p>

<p>I did not well, I meant well. All my services</p>

<p>You have paid home. But that you have vouchsafed,</p>

<p>With your crowned brother and these your contracted</p>

<p>Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,</p>

<p>It is a surplus of your grace which never</p>

<p>My life may last to answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  O Paulina,</p>

<p>We honor you with trouble. But we came</p>

<p>To see the statue of our queen. Your gallery</p>

<p>Have we passed through, not without much content</p>

<p>In many singularities; but we saw not</p>

<p>That which my daughter came to look upon,</p>

<p>The statue of her mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  As she lived peerless,</p>

<p>So her dead likeness, I do well believe,</p>

<p>Excels whatever yet you looked upon</p>

<p>Or hand of man hath done. Therefore I keep it</p>

<p>Lonely, apart. But here it is. Prepare</p>

<p>To see the life as lively mocked as ever</p>

<p>Still sleep mocked death. Behold, and say ’tis well.</p>

<p><center><i>[She draws a curtain</p>

<p>to reveal Hermione (like a statue).]</i></center></p>

<p>I like your silence. It the more shows off</p>

<p>Your wonder. But yet speak. First you, my liege.</p>

<p>Comes it not something near?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Her natural posture!–</p>

<p>Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed</p>

<p>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she</p>

<p>In thy not chiding, for she was as tender</p>

<p>As infancy and grace.–But yet, Paulina,</p>

<p>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing</p>

<p>So aged as this seems.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  O, not by much!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span></p>

<p>So much the more our carver’s excellence,</p>

<p>Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her</p>

<p>As she lived now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  As now she might have done,</p>

<p>So much to my good comfort as it is</p>

<p>Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,</p>

<p>Even with such life of majesty–warm life,</p>

<p>As now it coldly stands–when first I wooed her.</p>

<p>I am ashamed. Does not the stone rebuke me</p>

<p>For being more stone than it?–O royal piece,</p>

<p>There’s magic in thy majesty, which has</p>

<p>My evils conjured to remembrance and</p>

<p>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,</p>

<p>Standing like stone with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Perdita</span>  And give me leave,</p>

<p>And do not say ’tis superstition, that</p>

<p>I kneel, and then implore her blessing.     <i><i>[She kneels.]</i></i></p>

<p>Lady,</p>

<p>Dear queen, that ended when I but began,</p>

<p>Give me that hand of yours to kiss.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  O, patience!</p>

<p>The statue is but newly fixed; the color’s</p>

<p>Not dry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span> <i>[to Leontes, who weeps]</i></p>

<p>My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,</p>

<p>Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,</p>

<p>So many summers dry. Scarce any joy</p>

<p>Did ever so long live; no sorrow</p>

<p>But killed itself much sooner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  Dear my brother,</p>

<p>Let him that was the cause of this have power</p>

<p>To take off so much grief from you as he</p>

<p>Will piece up in himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  Indeed, my lord,</p>

<p>If I had thought the sight of my poor image</p>

<p>Would thus have wrought you–for the stone is</p>

<p>mine–</p>

<p>I’d not have showed it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Do not draw the curtain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span></p>

<p>No longer shall you gaze on ’t, lest your fancy</p>

<p>May think anon it moves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Let be, let be.</p>

<p>Would I were dead but that methinks already–</p>

<p>What was he that did make it?–See, my lord,</p>

<p>Would you not deem it breathed? And that those</p>

<p>veins</p>

<p>Did verily bear blood?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  Masterly done.</p>

<p>The very life seems warm upon her lip.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>The fixture of her eye has motion in ’t,</p>

<p>As we are mocked with art.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  I’ll draw the curtain.</p>

<p>My lord’s almost so far transported that</p>

<p>He’ll think anon it lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  O sweet Paulina,</p>

<p>Make me to think so twenty years together!</p>

<p>No settled senses of the world can match</p>

<p>The pleasure of that madness. Let ’t alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span></p>

<p>I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirred you, but</p>

<p>I could afflict you farther.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Do, Paulina,</p>

<p>For this affliction has a taste as sweet</p>

<p>As any cordial comfort. Still methinks</p>

<p>There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel</p>

<p>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,</p>

<p>For I will kiss her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  Good my lord, forbear.</p>

<p>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet.</p>

<p>You’ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own</p>

<p>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>No, not these twenty years.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Perdita</span> <i>[rising]</i>  So long could I</p>

<p>Stand by, a looker-on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  Either forbear,</p>

<p>Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you</p>

<p>For more amazement. If you can behold it,</p>

<p>I’ll make the statue move indeed, descend</p>

<p>And take you by the hand. But then you’ll think–</p>

<p>Which I protest against–I am assisted</p>

<p>By wicked powers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  What you can make her do</p>

<p>I am content to look on; what to speak,</p>

<p>I am content to hear, for ’tis as easy</p>

<p>To make her speak as move.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  It is required</p>

<p>You do awake your faith. Then all stand still–</p>

<p>Or those that think it is unlawful business</p>

<p>I am about, let them depart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Proceed.</p>

<p>No foot shall stir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  Music, awake her! Strike!</p>

<p><center><i>[Music sounds.]</i></center></p>

<p>’Tis time. Descend. Be stone no more. Approach.</p>

<p>Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,</p>

<p>I’ll fill your grave up. Stir, nay, come away.</p>

<p>Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him</p>

<p>Dear life redeems you.–You perceive she stirs.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Hermione descends.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>Start not. Her actions shall be holy as</p>

<p>You hear my spell is lawful. Do not shun her</p>

<p>Until you see her die again, for then</p>

<p>You kill her double. Nay, present your hand.</p>

<p>When she was young, you wooed her; now in age</p>

<p>Is she become the suitor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  O, she’s warm!</p>

<p>If this be magic, let it be an art</p>

<p>Lawful as eating.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  She embraces him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  She hangs about his neck.</p>

<p>If she pertain to life, let her speak too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span></p>

<p>Ay, and make it manifest where she has lived,</p>

<p>Or how stol’n from the dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  That she is living,</p>

<p>Were it but told you, should be hooted at</p>

<p>Like an old tale, but it appears she lives,</p>

<p>Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.</p>

<p><i>[To Perdita.]</i> Please you to interpose, fair madam.</p>

<p>Kneel</p>

<p>And pray your mother’s blessing. <i>[To Hermione.]</i></p>

<p>Turn, good lady.</p>

<p>Our Perdita is found.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  You gods, look down,</p>

<p>And from your sacred vials pour your graces</p>

<p>Upon my daughter’s head! Tell me, mine own,</p>

<p>Where hast thou been preserved? Where lived? How</p>

<p>found</p>

<p>Thy father’s court? For thou shalt hear that I,</p>

<p>Knowing by Paulina that the oracle</p>

<p>Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved</p>

<p>Myself to see the issue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  There’s time enough for that,</p>

<p>Lest they desire upon this push to trouble</p>

<p>Your joys with like relation. Go together,</p>

<p>You precious winners all. Your exultation</p>

<p>Partake to everyone. I, an old turtle,</p>

<p>Will wing me to some withered bough and there</p>

<p>My mate, that’s never to be found again,</p>

<p>Lament till I am lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  O peace, Paulina.</p>

<p>Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,</p>

<p>As I by thine a wife. This is a match,</p>

<p>And made between ’s by vows. Thou hast found</p>

<p>mine–</p>

<p>But how is to be questioned, for I saw her,</p>

<p>As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many</p>

<p>A prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far–</p>

<p>For him, I partly know his mind–to find thee</p>

<p>An honorable husband.–Come, Camillo,</p>

<p>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty</p>

<p>Is richly noted and here justified</p>

<p>By us, a pair of kings. Let’s from this place.</p>

<p><i>[To Hermione.]</i> What, look upon my brother! Both</p>

<p>your pardons</p>

<p>That e’er I put between your holy looks</p>

<p>My ill suspicion. This your son-in-law</p>

<p>And son unto the King, whom heavens directing,</p>

<p>Is troth-plight to your daughter.–Good Paulina,</p>

<p>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely</p>

<p>Each one demand and answer to his part</p>

<p>Performed in this wide gap of time since first</p>

<p>We were dissevered. Hastily lead away.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
