<p><center><i>[Enter Polixenes and Camillo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more</p>

<p>importunate. ’Tis a sickness denying thee anything,</p>

<p>a death to grant this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  It is fifteen years since I saw my country.</p>

<p>Though I have for the most part been aired abroad,</p>

<p>I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent</p>

<p>king, my master, hath sent for me, to whose feeling</p>

<p>sorrows I might be some allay–or I o’erween to</p>

<p>think so–which is another spur to my departure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  As thou lov’st me, Camillo, wipe not out the</p>

<p>rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I</p>

<p>have of thee thine own goodness hath made. Better</p>

<p>not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou,</p>

<p>having made me businesses which none without</p>

<p>thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to</p>

<p>execute them thyself or take away with thee the very</p>

<p>services thou hast done, which if I have not enough</p>

<p>considered, as too much I cannot, to be more</p>

<p>thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit</p>

<p>therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country</p>

<p>Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very</p>

<p>naming punishes me with the remembrance of that</p>

<p>penitent, as thou call’st him, and reconciled king</p>

<p>my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen</p>

<p>and children are even now to be afresh lamented.</p>

<p>Say to me, when sawst thou the Prince Florizell, my</p>

<p>son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not</p>

<p>being gracious, than they are in losing them when</p>

<p>they have approved their virtues.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince.</p>

<p>What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown,</p>

<p>but I have missingly noted he is of late</p>

<p>much retired from court and is less frequent to his</p>

<p>princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  I have considered so much, Camillo, and</p>

<p>with some care, so far that I have eyes under my</p>

<p>service which look upon his removedness, from</p>

<p>whom I have this intelligence: that he is seldom</p>

<p>from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man,</p>

<p>they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the</p>

<p>imagination of his neighbors, is grown into an</p>

<p>unspeakable estate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a</p>

<p>daughter of most rare note. The report of her is</p>

<p>extended more than can be thought to begin from</p>

<p>such a cottage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  That’s likewise part of my intelligence, but,</p>

<p>I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou</p>

<p>shalt accompany us to the place, where we will, not</p>

<p>appearing what we are, have some question with</p>

<p>the shepherd, from whose simplicity I think it not</p>

<p>uneasy to get the cause of my son’s resort thither.</p>

<p>Prithee be my present partner in this business, and</p>

<p>lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  I willingly obey your command.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  My best Camillo. We must disguise</p>

<p>ourselves.</p>
