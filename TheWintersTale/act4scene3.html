<p><center><i>[Enter Autolycus singing.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span></p>

<p>     <i>When daffodils begin to peer,</i></p>

<p>        <i>With heigh, the doxy over the dale,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Why, then comes in the sweet o’ the year,</i></p>

<p>        <i>For the red blood reigns in the winter’s pale.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,</i></p>

<p>        <i>With heigh, the sweet birds, O how they sing!</i></p>

<p>     <i>Doth set my pugging tooth an edge,</i></p>

<p>        <i>For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>The lark, that tirralirra chants,</i></p>

<p>        <i>With heigh, with heigh, the thrush and the jay,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Are summer songs for me and my aunts,</i></p>

<p>        <i>While we lie tumbling in the hay.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>I have served Prince Florizell and in my time wore</p>

<p>three-pile, but now I am out of service.</p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?</i></p>

<p>        <i>The pale moon shines by night,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And when I wander here and there,</i></p>

<p>        <i>I then do most go right.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>If tinkers may have leave to live,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And bear the sow-skin budget,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Then my account I well may give,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And in the stocks avouch it.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>My traffic is sheets. When the kite builds, look to</p>

<p>lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus, who,</p>

<p>being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise</p>

<p>a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and</p>

<p>drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is</p>

<p>the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful</p>

<p>on the highway. Beating and hanging are terrors to</p>

<p>me. For the life to come, I sleep out the thought of</p>

<p>it. A prize, a prize!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Shepherd’s Son.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Let me see, every ’leven wether tods,</p>

<p>every tod yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen</p>

<p>hundred shorn, what comes the wool to?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span> <i>[aside]</i>  If the springe hold, the cock’s</p>

<p>mine.     <i><i>[He lies down.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  I cannot do ’t without counters. Let</p>

<p>me see, what am I to buy for our sheep-shearing</p>

<p>feast? <i>[(He reads a paper.)]</i> Three pound of sugar,</p>

<p>five pound of currants, rice–what will this sister of</p>

<p>mine do with rice? But my father hath made her</p>

<p>mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. She hath</p>

<p>made me four-and-twenty nosegays for the shearers,</p>

<p>three-man song men all, and very good ones;</p>

<p>but they are most of them means and basses, but</p>

<p>one Puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to</p>

<p>hornpipes. I must have saffron to color the warden</p>

<p>pies; mace; dates, none, that’s out of my note;</p>

<p>nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I</p>

<p>may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of</p>

<p>raisins o’ th’ sun.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span> <i>[writhing as if in pain]</i>  O, that ever I was</p>

<p>born!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  I’ th’ name of me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  O, help me, help me! Pluck but off these</p>

<p>rags, and then death, death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Alack, poor soul, thou hast need of</p>

<p>more rags to lay on thee rather than have these off.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends</p>

<p>me more than the stripes I have received, which are</p>

<p>mighty ones and millions.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Alas, poor man, a million of beating</p>

<p>may come to a great matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  I am robbed, sir, and beaten, my money</p>

<p>and apparel ta’en from me, and these detestable</p>

<p>things put upon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  What, by a horseman, or a footman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  A footman, sweet sir, a footman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Indeed, he should be a footman by</p>

<p>the garments he has left with thee. If this be a</p>

<p>horseman’s coat, it hath seen very hot service. Lend</p>

<p>me thy hand; I’ll help thee. Come, lend me thy</p>

<p>hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  O, good sir, tenderly, O!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Alas, poor soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  O, good sir, softly, good sir. I fear, sir, my</p>

<p>shoulder blade is out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  How now? Canst stand?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span> <i>[stealing the Shepherd’s Son’s purse]</i>  Softly,</p>

<p>dear sir, good sir, softly. You ha’ done me a charitable</p>

<p>office.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Dost lack any money? I have a little</p>

<p>money for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  No, good sweet sir, no, I beseech you, sir. I</p>

<p>have a kinsman not past three-quarters of a mile</p>

<p>hence, unto whom I was going. I shall there have</p>

<p>money or anything I want. Offer me no money, I</p>

<p>pray you; that kills my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  What manner of fellow was he that</p>

<p>robbed you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about</p>

<p>with troll-my-dames. I knew him once a servant of</p>

<p>the Prince. I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his</p>

<p>virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of</p>

<p>the court.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  His vices, you would say. There’s no</p>

<p>virtue whipped out of the court. They cherish it to</p>

<p>make it stay there, and yet it will no more but abide.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man</p>

<p>well. He hath been since an ape-bearer, then a</p>

<p>process-server, a bailiff. Then he compassed a motion</p>

<p>of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker’s wife</p>

<p>within a mile where my land and living lies, and,</p>

<p>having flown over many knavish professions, he</p>

<p>settled only in rogue. Some call him Autolycus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Out upon him! Prig, for my life, prig!</p>

<p>He haunts wakes, fairs, and bearbaitings.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  Very true, sir: he, sir, he. That’s the rogue</p>

<p>that put me into this apparel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Not a more cowardly rogue in all</p>

<p>Bohemia. If you had but looked big and spit at him,</p>

<p>he’d have run.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter. I</p>

<p>am false of heart that way, and that he knew, I</p>

<p>warrant him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  How do you now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  Sweet sir, much better than I was. I can</p>

<p>stand and walk. I will even take my leave of you and</p>

<p>pace softly towards my kinsman’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Shall I bring thee on the way?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  No, good-faced sir, no, sweet sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Then fare thee well. I must go buy</p>

<p>spices for our sheep-shearing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  Prosper you, sweet sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[Shepherd’s Son exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your</p>

<p>spice. I’ll be with you at your sheep-shearing too. If</p>

<p>I make not this cheat bring out another, and the</p>

<p>shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my</p>

<p>name put in the book of virtue.</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>Jog on, jog on, the footpath way,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And merrily hent the stile-a.</i></p>

<p>     <i>A merry heart goes all the day,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Your sad tires in a mile-a.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
