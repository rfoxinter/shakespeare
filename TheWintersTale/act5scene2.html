<p><center><i>[Enter Autolycus and a Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  Beseech you, sir, were you present at this</p>

<p>relation?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  I was by at the opening of the fardel,</p>

<p>heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he</p>

<p>found it, whereupon, after a little amazedness, we</p>

<p>were all commanded out of the chamber. Only this,</p>

<p>methought, I heard the shepherd say: he found the</p>

<p>child.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  I would most gladly know the issue of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  I make a broken delivery of the</p>

<p>business, but the changes I perceived in the King</p>

<p>and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They</p>

<p>seemed almost, with staring on one another, to tear</p>

<p>the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their</p>

<p>dumbness, language in their very gesture. They</p>

<p>looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or</p>

<p>one destroyed. A notable passion of wonder appeared</p>

<p>in them, but the wisest beholder that knew</p>

<p>no more but seeing could not say if th’ importance</p>

<p>were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one it</p>

<p>must needs be.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter another Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more.–</p>

<p>The news, Rogero?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Nothing but bonfires. The oracle</p>

<p>is fulfilled: the King’s daughter is found! Such a</p>

<p>deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that</p>

<p>ballad makers cannot be able to express it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter another Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward. He can</p>

<p>deliver you more.–How goes it now, sir? This news</p>

<p>which is called true is so like an old tale that the</p>

<p>verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King</p>

<p>found his heir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Most true, if ever truth were pregnant</p>

<p>by circumstance. That which you hear you’ll</p>

<p>swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The</p>

<p>mantle of Queen Hermione’s, her jewel about the</p>

<p>neck of it, the letters of Antigonus found with it,</p>

<p>which they know to be his character, the majesty of</p>

<p>the creature in resemblance of the mother, the</p>

<p>affection of nobleness which nature shows above</p>

<p>her breeding, and many other evidences proclaim</p>

<p>her with all certainty to be the King’s daughter. Did</p>

<p>you see the meeting of the two kings?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Then have you lost a sight which</p>

<p>was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might</p>

<p>you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in</p>

<p>such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take</p>

<p>leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There</p>

<p>was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with</p>

<p>countenance of such distraction that they were to</p>

<p>be known by garment, not by favor. Our king, being</p>

<p>ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found</p>

<p>daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss,</p>

<p>cries “O, thy mother, thy mother!” then asks Bohemia</p>

<p>forgiveness, then embraces his son-in-law, then</p>

<p>again worries he his daughter with clipping her.</p>

<p>Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by</p>

<p>like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns.</p>

<p>I never heard of such another encounter, which</p>

<p>lames report to follow it and undoes description to</p>

<p>do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  What, pray you, became of Antigonus,</p>

<p>that carried hence the child?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Like an old tale still, which will</p>

<p>have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and</p>

<p>not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear.</p>

<p>This avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only</p>

<p>his innocence, which seems much, to justify him,</p>

<p>but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina</p>

<p>knows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  What became of his bark and his</p>

<p>followers?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Wracked the same instant of their</p>

<p>master’s death and in the view of the shepherd, so</p>

<p>that all the instruments which aided to expose the</p>

<p>child were even then lost when it was found. But O,</p>

<p>the noble combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was</p>

<p>fought in Paulina. She had one eye declined for the</p>

<p>loss of her husband, another elevated that the</p>

<p>oracle was fulfilled. She lifted the Princess from the</p>

<p>earth, and so locks her in embracing as if she would</p>

<p>pin her to her heart that she might no more be in</p>

<p>danger of losing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  The dignity of this act was worth the</p>

<p>audience of kings and princes, for by such was it</p>

<p>acted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  One of the prettiest touches of all,</p>

<p>and that which angled for mine eyes–caught the</p>

<p>water, though not the fish–was when at the relation</p>

<p>of the Queen’s death–with the manner how</p>

<p>she came to ’t bravely confessed and lamented by</p>

<p>the King–how attentiveness wounded his daughter,</p>

<p>till, from one sign of dolor to another, she did,</p>

<p>with an “Alas,” I would fain say bleed tears, for I am</p>

<p>sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble</p>

<p>there changed color; some swooned, all sorrowed.</p>

<p>If all the world could have seen ’t, the woe had been</p>

<p>universal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Are they returned to the court?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  No. The Princess hearing of her</p>

<p>mother’s statue, which is in the keeping of</p>

<p>Paulina–a piece many years in doing and now</p>

<p>newly performed by that rare Italian master, Julio</p>

<p>Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could</p>

<p>put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of</p>

<p>her custom, so perfectly he is her ape; he so near to</p>

<p>Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one</p>

<p>would speak to her and stand in hope of answer.</p>

<p>Thither with all greediness of affection are they</p>

<p>gone, and there they intend to sup.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  I thought she had some great</p>

<p>matter there in hand, for she hath privately twice or</p>

<p>thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione,</p>

<p>visited that removed house. Shall we thither and</p>

<p>with our company piece the rejoicing?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Who would be thence that has the</p>

<p>benefit of access? Every wink of an eye some new</p>

<p>grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty</p>

<p>to our knowledge. Let’s along.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Three Gentlemen exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  Now, had I not the dash of my former life</p>

<p>in me, would preferment drop on my head. I</p>

<p>brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince,</p>

<p>told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know</p>

<p>not what. But he at that time, overfond of the</p>

<p>shepherd’s daughter–so he then took her to be–</p>

<p>who began to be much seasick, and himself little</p>

<p>better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery</p>

<p>remained undiscovered. But ’tis all one to</p>

<p>me, for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it</p>

<p>would not have relished among my other</p>

<p>discredits.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Shepherd and Shepherd’s Son,</p>

<p>both dressed in rich clothing.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here come those I have done good to against my</p>

<p>will, and already appearing in the blossoms of their</p>

<p>fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  Come, boy, I am past more children, but thy</p>

<p>sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span> <i>[to Autolycus]</i>  You are well met, sir.</p>

<p>You denied to fight with me this other day because I</p>

<p>was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say</p>

<p>you see them not and think me still no gentleman</p>

<p>born. You were best say these robes are not gentlemen</p>

<p>born. Give me the lie, do, and try whether I am</p>

<p>not now a gentleman born.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Ay, and have been so any time these</p>

<p>four hours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  And so have I, boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  So you have–but I was a gentleman</p>

<p>born before my father. For the King’s son took me</p>

<p>by the hand and called me brother, and then the</p>

<p>two kings called my father brother, and then the</p>

<p>Prince my brother and the Princess my sister called</p>

<p>my father father; and so we wept, and there was the</p>

<p>first gentlemanlike tears that ever we shed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  We may live, son, to shed many more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Ay, or else ’twere hard luck, being in</p>

<p>so preposterous estate as we are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all</p>

<p>the faults I have committed to your Worship and to</p>

<p>give me your good report to the Prince my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  Prithee, son, do, for we must be gentle now</p>

<p>we are gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span> <i>[to Autolycus]</i>  Thou wilt amend thy</p>

<p>life?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  Ay, an it like your good Worship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Give me thy hand. I will swear to the</p>

<p>Prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in</p>

<p>Bohemia.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  You may say it, but not swear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Not swear it, now I am a gentleman?</p>

<p>Let boors and franklins say it; I’ll swear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  How if it be false, son?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  If it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman</p>

<p>may swear it in the behalf of his friend.–And</p>

<p>I’ll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy</p>

<p>hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know</p>

<p>thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou</p>

<p>wilt be drunk. But I’ll swear it, and I would thou</p>

<p>wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Autolycus</span>  I will prove so, sir, to my power.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow. If</p>

<p>I do not wonder how thou dar’st venture to be</p>

<p>drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark,</p>

<p>the Kings and Princes, our kindred, are going to see</p>

<p>the Queen’s picture. Come, follow us. We’ll be thy</p>

<p>good masters.</p>
