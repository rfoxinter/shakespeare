<p><center><i>[Enter Leontes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc></p>

<p>Nor night nor day no rest. It is but weakness</p>

<p>To bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If</p>

<p>The cause were not in being–part o’ th’ cause,</p>

<p>She th’ adult’ress, for the harlot king</p>

<p>Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank</p>

<p>And level of my brain, plot-proof. But she</p>

<p>I can hook to me. Say that she were gone,</p>

<p>Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest</p>

<p>Might come to me again.–Who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  My lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  How does the boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  He took good rest tonight. ’Tis hoped</p>

<p>His sickness is discharged.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  To see his nobleness,</p>

<p>Conceiving the dishonor of his mother.</p>

<p>He straight declined, drooped, took it deeply,</p>

<p>Fastened and fixed the shame on ’t in himself,</p>

<p>Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,</p>

<p>And downright languished. Leave me solely. Go,</p>

<p>See how he fares.     <i><i>[Servant exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Fie, fie, no thought of him.</p>

<p>The very thought of my revenges that way</p>

<p>Recoil upon me–in himself too mighty,</p>

<p>And in his parties, his alliance. Let him be</p>

<p>Until a time may serve. For present vengeance,</p>

<p>Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes</p>

<p>Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow.</p>

<p>They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor</p>

<p>Shall she within my power.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Paulina, carrying the baby, with Servants,</p>

<p>Antigonus, and Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  You must not enter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc></p>

<p>Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me.</p>

<p>Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,</p>

<p>Than the Queen’s life? A gracious innocent soul,</p>

<p>More free than he is jealous.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc>  That’s enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>Madam, he hath not slept tonight, commanded</p>

<p>None should come at him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  Not so hot, good sir.</p>

<p>I come to bring him sleep. ’Tis such as you</p>

<p>That creep like shadows by him and do sigh</p>

<p>At each his needless heavings, such as you</p>

<p>Nourish the cause of his awaking. I</p>

<p>Do come with words as medicinal as true,</p>

<p>Honest as either, to purge him of that humor</p>

<p>That presses him from sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  What noise there, ho?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc></p>

<p>No noise, my lord, but needful conference</p>

<p>About some gossips for your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  How?–</p>

<p>Away with that audacious lady. Antigonus,</p>

<p>I charged thee that she should not come about me.</p>

<p>I knew she would.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc>  I told her so, my lord,</p>

<p>On your displeasure’s peril and on mine,</p>

<p>She should not visit you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  What, canst not rule her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc></p>

<p>From all dishonesty he can. In this,</p>

<p>Unless he take the course that you have done–</p>

<p>Commit me for committing honor–trust it,</p>

<p>He shall not rule me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc>  La you now, you hear.</p>

<p>When she will take the rein I let her run,</p>

<p>But she’ll not stumble.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  Good my liege, I come–</p>

<p>And I beseech you hear me, who professes</p>

<p>Myself your loyal servant, your physician,</p>

<p>Your most obedient counselor, yet that dares</p>

<p>Less appear so in comforting your evils</p>

<p>Than such as most seem yours–I say I come</p>

<p>From your good queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Good queen?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc></p>

<p>Good queen, my lord, good queen, I say “good</p>

<p>queen,”</p>

<p>And would by combat make her good, so were I</p>

<p>A man, the worst about you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Force her hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc></p>

<p>Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes</p>

<p>First hand me. On mine own accord I’ll off,</p>

<p>But first I’ll do my errand.–The good queen,</p>

<p>For she is good, hath brought you forth a</p>

<p>daughter–</p>

<p>Here ’tis–commends it to your blessing.</p>

<p><center><i>[She lays down the baby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Out!</p>

<p>A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o’ door.</p>

<p>A most intelligencing bawd.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  Not so.</p>

<p>I am as ignorant in that as you</p>

<p>In so entitling me, and no less honest</p>

<p>Than you are mad–which is enough, I’ll warrant,</p>

<p>As this world goes, to pass for honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Traitors,</p>

<p>Will you not push her out? <i>[To Antigonus.]</i> Give her</p>

<p>the bastard,</p>

<p>Thou dotard; thou art woman-tired, unroosted</p>

<p>By thy Dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard,</p>

<p>Take ’t up, I say. Give ’t to thy crone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc> <i>[to Antigonus]</i>  Forever</p>

<p>Unvenerable be thy hands if thou</p>

<p>Tak’st up the Princess by that forced baseness</p>

<p>Which he has put upon ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  He dreads his wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc></p>

<p>So I would you did. Then ’twere past all doubt</p>

<p>You’d call your children yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  A nest of traitors!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc></p>

<p>I am none, by this good light.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  Nor I, nor any</p>

<p>But one that’s here, and that’s himself. For he</p>

<p>The sacred honor of himself, his queen’s,</p>

<p>His hopeful son’s, his babe’s, betrays to slander,</p>

<p>Whose sting is sharper than the sword’s; and will</p>

<p>not–</p>

<p>For, as the case now stands, it is a curse</p>

<p>He cannot be compelled to ’t–once remove</p>

<p>The root of his opinion, which is rotten</p>

<p>As ever oak or stone was sound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  A callet</p>

<p>Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her</p>

<p>husband</p>

<p>And now baits me! This brat is none of mine.</p>

<p>It is the issue of Polixenes.</p>

<p>Hence with it, and together with the dam</p>

<p>Commit them to the fire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  It is yours,</p>

<p>And, might we lay th’ old proverb to your charge,</p>

<p>So like you ’tis the worse.–Behold, my lords,</p>

<p>Although the print be little, the whole matter</p>

<p>And copy of the father–eye, nose, lip,</p>

<p>The trick of ’s frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,</p>

<p>The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek, his</p>

<p>smiles,</p>

<p>The very mold and frame of hand, nail, finger.</p>

<p>And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it</p>

<p>So like to him that got it, if thou hast</p>

<p>The ordering of the mind too, ’mongst all colors</p>

<p>No yellow in ’t, lest she suspect, as he does,</p>

<p>Her children not her husband’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  A gross hag!–</p>

<p>And, losel, thou art worthy to be hanged</p>

<p>That wilt not stay her tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc>  Hang all the husbands</p>

<p>That cannot do that feat, you’ll leave yourself</p>

<p>Hardly one subject.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Once more, take her hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc></p>

<p>A most unworthy and unnatural lord</p>

<p>Can do no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  I’ll ha’ thee burnt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc>  I care not.</p>

<p>It is an heretic that makes the fire,</p>

<p>Not she which burns in ’t. I’ll not call you tyrant;</p>

<p>But this most cruel usage of your queen,</p>

<p>Not able to produce more accusation</p>

<p>Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something</p>

<p>savors</p>

<p>Of tyranny, and will ignoble make you,</p>

<p>Yea, scandalous to the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc> <i>[to Antigonus]</i>  On your allegiance,</p>

<p>Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,</p>

<p>Where were her life? She durst not call me so</p>

<p>If she did know me one. Away with her!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Paulina</sc> <i>[to Lords]</i></p>

<p>I pray you do not push me; I’ll be gone.–</p>

<p>Look to your babe, my lord; ’tis yours. Jove send her</p>

<p>A better guiding spirit.–What needs these hands?</p>

<p>You that are thus so tender o’er his follies</p>

<p>Will never do him good, not one of you.</p>

<p>So, so. Farewell, we are gone.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc> <i>[to Antigonus]</i></p>

<p>Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.</p>

<p>My child? Away with ’t! Even thou, that hast</p>

<p>A heart so tender o’er it, take it hence,</p>

<p>And see it instantly consumed with fire.</p>

<p>Even thou, and none but thou. Take it up straight.</p>

<p>Within this hour bring me word ’tis done,</p>

<p>And by good testimony, or I’ll seize thy life,</p>

<p>With what thou else call’st thine. If thou refuse</p>

<p>And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so.</p>

<p>The bastard brains with these my proper hands</p>

<p>Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire,</p>

<p>For thou sett’st on thy wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc>  I did not, sir.</p>

<p>These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,</p>

<p>Can clear me in ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lords</sc>  We can, my royal liege.</p>

<p>He is not guilty of her coming hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  You’re liars all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Beseech your Highness, give us better credit.</p>

<p>We have always truly served you, and beseech</p>

<p>So to esteem of us. And on our knees we beg,</p>

<p>As recompense of our dear services</p>

<p>Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,</p>

<p>Which being so horrible, so bloody, must</p>

<p>Lead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc></p>

<p>I am a feather for each wind that blows.</p>

<p>Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel</p>

<p>And call me father? Better burn it now</p>

<p>Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.</p>

<p>It shall not neither. <i>[To Antigonus.]</i> You, sir, come</p>

<p>you hither,</p>

<p>You that have been so tenderly officious</p>

<p>With Lady Margery, your midwife there,</p>

<p>To save this bastard’s life–for ’tis a bastard,</p>

<p>So sure as this beard’s gray. What will you</p>

<p>adventure</p>

<p>To save this brat’s life?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc>  Anything, my lord,</p>

<p>That my ability may undergo</p>

<p>And nobleness impose. At least thus much:</p>

<p>I’ll pawn the little blood which I have left</p>

<p>To save the innocent. Anything possible.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc></p>

<p>It shall be possible. Swear by this sword</p>

<p>Thou wilt perform my bidding.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc> <i>[his hand on the hilt]</i>  I will, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc></p>

<p>Mark, and perform it, seest thou; for the fail</p>

<p>Of any point in ’t shall not only be</p>

<p>Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,</p>

<p>Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,</p>

<p>As thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry</p>

<p>This female bastard hence, and that thou bear it</p>

<p>To some remote and desert place quite out</p>

<p>Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,</p>

<p>Without more mercy, to it own protection</p>

<p>And favor of the climate. As by strange fortune</p>

<p>It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,</p>

<p>On thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture,</p>

<p>That thou commend it strangely to some place</p>

<p>Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc></p>

<p>I swear to do this, though a present death</p>

<p>Had been more merciful.–Come on, poor babe.</p>

<p><center><i>[He picks up the baby.]</i></center></p>

<p>Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens</p>

<p>To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,</p>

<p>Casting their savageness aside, have done</p>

<p>Like offices of pity. <i>[To Leontes.]</i> Sir, be prosperous</p>

<p>In more than this deed does require.–And blessing</p>

<p>Against this cruelty fight on thy side,</p>

<p>Poor thing, condemned to loss.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits, carrying the baby.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  No, I’ll not rear</p>

<p>Another’s issue.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  Please your Highness, posts</p>

<p>From those you sent to th’ oracle are come</p>

<p>An hour since. Cleomenes and Dion,</p>

<p>Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,</p>

<p>Hasting to th’ court.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc> <i>[to Leontes]</i>  So please you, sir, their speed</p>

<p>Hath been beyond account.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Twenty-three days</p>

<p>They have been absent. ’Tis good speed, foretells</p>

<p>The great Apollo suddenly will have</p>

<p>The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords.</p>

<p>Summon a session, that we may arraign</p>

<p>Our most disloyal lady; for, as she hath</p>

<p>Been publicly accused, so shall she have</p>

<p>A just and open trial. While she lives,</p>

<p>My heart will be a burden to me. Leave me,</p>

<p>And think upon my bidding.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
