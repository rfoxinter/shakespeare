<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,</p>

<p>Even pushes ’gainst our heart: the party tried</p>

<p>The daughter of a king, our wife, and one</p>

<p>Of us too much beloved. Let us be cleared</p>

<p>Of being tyrannous, since we so openly</p>

<p>Proceed in justice, which shall have due course</p>

<p>Even to the guilt or the purgation.</p>

<p>Produce the prisoner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Officer</span></p>

<p>It is his Highness’ pleasure that the Queen</p>

<p>Appear in person here in court.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hermione, as to her trial, Paulina, and Ladies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Silence!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Read the indictment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Officer</span> <i>[reads]</i>  Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes,</p>

<p>King of Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned</p>

<p>of high treason, in committing adultery with Polixenes,</p>

<p>King of Bohemia, and conspiring with Camillo</p>

<p>to take away the life of our sovereign lord the King, thy</p>

<p>royal husband; the pretense whereof being by circumstances</p>

<p>partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to</p>

<p>the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel</p>

<p>and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by</p>

<p>night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span></p>

<p>Since what I am to say must be but that</p>

<p>Which contradicts my accusation, and</p>

<p>The testimony on my part no other</p>

<p>But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me</p>

<p>To say “Not guilty.” Mine integrity,</p>

<p>Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,</p>

<p>Be so received. But thus: if powers divine</p>

<p>Behold our human actions, as they do,</p>

<p>I doubt not then but innocence shall make</p>

<p>False accusation blush and tyranny</p>

<p>Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,</p>

<p>Whom least will seem to do so, my past life</p>

<p>Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,</p>

<p>As I am now unhappy; which is more</p>

<p>Than history can pattern, though devised</p>

<p>And played to take spectators. For behold me,</p>

<p>A fellow of the royal bed, which owe</p>

<p>A moiety of the throne, a great king’s daughter,</p>

<p>The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing</p>

<p>To prate and talk for life and honor fore</p>

<p>Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it</p>

<p>As I weigh grief, which I would spare. For honor,</p>

<p>’Tis a derivative from me to mine,</p>

<p>And only that I stand for. I appeal</p>

<p>To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes</p>

<p>Came to your court, how I was in your grace,</p>

<p>How merited to be so; since he came,</p>

<p>With what encounter so uncurrent I</p>

<p>Have strained t’ appear thus; if one jot beyond</p>

<p>The bound of honor, or in act or will</p>

<p>That way inclining, hardened be the hearts</p>

<p>Of all that hear me, and my near’st of kin</p>

<p>Cry fie upon my grave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  I ne’er heard yet</p>

<p>That any of these bolder vices wanted</p>

<p>Less impudence to gainsay what they did</p>

<p>Than to perform it first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  That’s true enough,</p>

<p>Though ’tis a saying, sir, not due to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>You will not own it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  More than mistress of</p>

<p>Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not</p>

<p>At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,</p>

<p>With whom I am accused, I do confess</p>

<p>I loved him as in honor he required,</p>

<p>With such a kind of love as might become</p>

<p>A lady like me, with a love even such,</p>

<p>So and no other, as yourself commanded,</p>

<p>Which not to have done, I think, had been in me</p>

<p>Both disobedience and ingratitude</p>

<p>To you and toward your friend, whose love had</p>

<p>spoke,</p>

<p>Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely</p>

<p>That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,</p>

<p>I know not how it tastes, though it be dished</p>

<p>For me to try how. All I know of it</p>

<p>Is that Camillo was an honest man;</p>

<p>And why he left your court, the gods themselves,</p>

<p>Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>You knew of his departure, as you know</p>

<p>What you have underta’en to do in ’s absence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  Sir,</p>

<p>You speak a language that I understand not.</p>

<p>My life stands in the level of your dreams,</p>

<p>Which I’ll lay down.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Your actions are my dreams.</p>

<p>You had a bastard by Polixenes,</p>

<p>And I but dreamed it. As you were past all shame–</p>

<p>Those of your fact are so–so past all truth,</p>

<p>Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as</p>

<p>Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,</p>

<p>No father owning it–which is indeed</p>

<p>More criminal in thee than it–so thou</p>

<p>Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage</p>

<p>Look for no less than death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  Sir, spare your threats.</p>

<p>The bug which you would fright me with I seek.</p>

<p>To me can life be no commodity.</p>

<p>The crown and comfort of my life, your favor,</p>

<p>I do give lost, for I do feel it gone,</p>

<p>But know not how it went. My second joy</p>

<p>And first fruits of my body, from his presence</p>

<p>I am barred like one infectious. My third comfort,</p>

<p>Starred most unluckily, is from my breast,</p>

<p>The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth,</p>

<p>Haled out to murder; myself on every post</p>

<p>Proclaimed a strumpet; with immodest hatred</p>

<p>The childbed privilege denied, which longs</p>

<p>To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried</p>

<p>Here to this place, i’ th’ open air, before</p>

<p>I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,</p>

<p>Tell me what blessings I have here alive,</p>

<p>That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.</p>

<p>But yet hear this (mistake me not: no life,</p>

<p>I prize it not a straw, but for mine honor,</p>

<p>Which I would free), if I shall be condemned</p>

<p>Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else</p>

<p>But what your jealousies awake, I tell you</p>

<p>’Tis rigor, and not law. Your Honors all,</p>

<p>I do refer me to the oracle.</p>

<p>Apollo be my judge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span>  This your request</p>

<p>Is altogether just. Therefore bring forth,</p>

<p>And in Apollo’s name, his oracle.     <i><i>[Officers exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span></p>

<p>The Emperor of Russia was my father.</p>

<p>O, that he were alive and here beholding</p>

<p>His daughter’s trial, that he did but see</p>

<p>The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes</p>

<p>Of pity, not revenge.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cleomenes, Dion, with Officers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Officer</span> <i>[presenting a sword]</i></p>

<p>You here shall swear upon this sword of justice</p>

<p>That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have</p>

<p>Been both at Delphos, and from thence have</p>

<p>brought</p>

<p>This sealed-up oracle, by the hand delivered</p>

<p>Of great Apollo’s priest, and that since then</p>

<p>You have not dared to break the holy seal</p>

<p>Nor read the secrets in ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleomenes</span> <span class='sc'>Dion</span>  All this we swear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Break up the seals and read.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Officer</span> <i>[reads]</i>  Hermione is chaste, Polixenes blameless,</p>

<p>Camillo a true subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant,</p>

<p>his innocent babe truly begotten; and the King shall</p>

<p>live without an heir if that which is lost be not</p>

<p>found.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lords</span></p>

<p>Now blessed be the great Apollo!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  Praised!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Hast thou read truth?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Officer</span></p>

<p>Ay, my lord, even so as it is here set down.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>There is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle.</p>

<p>The sessions shall proceed. This is mere falsehood.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span></p>

<p>My lord the King, the King!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  What is the business?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span></p>

<p>O sir, I shall be hated to report it.</p>

<p>The Prince your son, with mere conceit and fear</p>

<p>Of the Queen’s speed, is gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  How? Gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span>  Is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>Apollo’s angry, and the heavens themselves</p>

<p>Do strike at my injustice.</p>

<p><center><i>[Hermione falls.]</i></center></p>

<p>How now there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span></p>

<p>This news is mortal to the Queen. Look down</p>

<p>And see what death is doing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Take her hence.</p>

<p>Her heart is but o’ercharged. She will recover.</p>

<p>I have too much believed mine own suspicion.</p>

<p>Beseech you, tenderly apply to her</p>

<p>Some remedies for life.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Paulina exits with Officers carrying Hermione.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Apollo, pardon</p>

<p>My great profaneness ’gainst thine oracle.</p>

<p>I’ll reconcile me to Polixenes,</p>

<p>New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,</p>

<p>Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;</p>

<p>For, being transported by my jealousies</p>

<p>To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose</p>

<p>Camillo for the minister to poison</p>

<p>My friend Polixenes, which had been done</p>

<p>But that the good mind of Camillo tardied</p>

<p>My swift command, though I with death and with</p>

<p>Reward did threaten and encourage him,</p>

<p>Not doing it and being done. He, most humane</p>

<p>And filled with honor, to my kingly guest</p>

<p>Unclasped my practice, quit his fortunes here,</p>

<p>Which you knew great, and to the hazard</p>

<p>Of all incertainties himself commended,</p>

<p>No richer than his honor. How he glisters</p>

<p>Through my rust, and how his piety</p>

<p>Does my deeds make the blacker!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Paulina.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  Woe the while!</p>

<p>O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,</p>

<p>Break too!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span>  What fit is this, good lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span> <i>[to Leontes]</i></p>

<p>What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?</p>

<p>What wheels, racks, fires? What flaying? Boiling</p>

<p>In leads or oils? What old or newer torture</p>

<p>Must I receive, whose every word deserves</p>

<p>To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny,</p>

<p>Together working with thy jealousies,</p>

<p>Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle</p>

<p>For girls of nine, O, think what they have done,</p>

<p>And then run mad indeed, stark mad, for all</p>

<p>Thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it.</p>

<p>That thou betrayedst Polixenes, ’twas nothing;</p>

<p>That did but show thee of a fool, inconstant</p>

<p>And damnable ingrateful. Nor was ’t much</p>

<p>Thou wouldst have poisoned good Camillo’s honor,</p>

<p>To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,</p>

<p>More monstrous standing by, whereof I reckon</p>

<p>The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter</p>

<p>To be or none or little, though a devil</p>

<p>Would have shed water out of fire ere done ’t.</p>

<p>Nor is ’t directly laid to thee the death</p>

<p>Of the young prince, whose honorable thoughts,</p>

<p>Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart</p>

<p>That could conceive a gross and foolish sire</p>

<p>Blemished his gracious dam. This is not, no,</p>

<p>Laid to thy answer. But the last–O lords,</p>

<p>When I have said, cry woe!–the Queen, the Queen,</p>

<p>The sweet’st, dear’st creature’s dead, and vengeance</p>

<p>for ’t</p>

<p>Not dropped down yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span>  The higher powers forbid!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span></p>

<p>I say she’s dead. I’ll swear ’t. If word nor oath</p>

<p>Prevail not, go and see. If you can bring</p>

<p>Tincture or luster in her lip, her eye,</p>

<p>Heat outwardly or breath within, I’ll serve you</p>

<p>As I would do the gods.–But, O thou tyrant,</p>

<p>Do not repent these things, for they are heavier</p>

<p>Than all thy woes can stir. Therefore betake thee</p>

<p>To nothing but despair. A thousand knees</p>

<p>Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,</p>

<p>Upon a barren mountain, and still winter</p>

<p>In storm perpetual, could not move the gods</p>

<p>To look that way thou wert.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Go on, go on.</p>

<p>Thou canst not speak too much. I have deserved</p>

<p>All tongues to talk their bitt’rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span> <i>[to Paulina]</i>  Say no more.</p>

<p>Howe’er the business goes, you have made fault</p>

<p>I’ th’ boldness of your speech.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paulina</span>  I am sorry for ’t.</p>

<p>All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,</p>

<p>I do repent. Alas, I have showed too much</p>

<p>The rashness of a woman. He is touched</p>

<p>To th’ noble heart.–What’s gone and what’s past</p>

<p>help</p>

<p>Should be past grief. Do not receive affliction</p>

<p>At my petition. I beseech you, rather</p>

<p>Let me be punished, that have minded you</p>

<p>Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege,</p>

<p>Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman.</p>

<p>The love I bore your queen–lo, fool again!–</p>

<p>I’ll speak of her no more, nor of your children.</p>

<p>I’ll not remember you of my own lord,</p>

<p>Who is lost too. Take your patience to you,</p>

<p>And I’ll say nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Thou didst speak but well</p>

<p>When most the truth, which I receive much better</p>

<p>Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me</p>

<p>To the dead bodies of my queen and son.</p>

<p>One grave shall be for both. Upon them shall</p>

<p>The causes of their death appear, unto</p>

<p>Our shame perpetual. Once a day I’ll visit</p>

<p>The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there</p>

<p>Shall be my recreation. So long as nature</p>

<p>Will bear up with this exercise, so long</p>

<p>I daily vow to use it. Come, and lead me</p>

<p>To these sorrows.</p>
