<p><center><i>[Enter Camillo and Archidamus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archidamus</span>  If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia</p>

<p>on the like occasion whereon my services</p>

<p>are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said, great</p>

<p>difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  I think this coming summer the King of</p>

<p>Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which</p>

<p>he justly owes him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archidamus</span>  Wherein our entertainment shall shame</p>

<p>us; we will be justified in our loves. For indeed–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  Beseech you–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archidamus</span>  Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my</p>

<p>knowledge. We cannot with such magnificence–in</p>

<p>so rare–I know not what to say. We will give you</p>

<p>sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our</p>

<p>insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as</p>

<p>little accuse us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given</p>

<p>freely.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archidamus</span>  Believe me, I speak as my understanding</p>

<p>instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to</p>

<p>utterance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.</p>

<p>They were trained together in their childhoods,</p>

<p>and there rooted betwixt them then such an</p>

<p>affection which cannot choose but branch now.</p>

<p>Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities</p>

<p>made separation of their society, their encounters,</p>

<p>though not personal, hath been royally</p>

<p>attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving</p>

<p>embassies, that they have seemed to be together</p>

<p>though absent, shook hands as over a vast, and</p>

<p>embraced as it were from the ends of opposed</p>

<p>winds. The heavens continue their loves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archidamus</span>  I think there is not in the world either</p>

<p>malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable</p>

<p>comfort of your young Prince Mamillius. It is a</p>

<p>gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came</p>

<p>into my note.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  I very well agree with you in the hopes of</p>

<p>him. It is a gallant child–one that indeed physics</p>

<p>the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that went</p>

<p>on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to</p>

<p>see him a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archidamus</span>  Would they else be content to die?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  Yes, if there were no other excuse why they</p>

<p>should desire to live.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Archidamus</span>  If the King had no son, they would desire</p>

<p>to live on crutches till he had one.</p>
