<p><center><i>[Enter Leontes, Hermione, Mamillius, Polixenes, Camillo,</p>

<p>and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span></p>

<p>Nine changes of the wat’ry star hath been</p>

<p>The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne</p>

<p>Without a burden. Time as long again</p>

<p>Would be filled up, my brother, with our thanks,</p>

<p>And yet we should for perpetuity</p>

<p>Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher,</p>

<p>Yet standing in rich place, I multiply</p>

<p>With one “We thank you” many thousands more</p>

<p>That go before it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Stay your thanks awhile,</p>

<p>And pay them when you part.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  Sir, that’s tomorrow.</p>

<p>I am questioned by my fears of what may chance</p>

<p>Or breed upon our absence, that may blow</p>

<p>No sneaping winds at home to make us say</p>

<p>“This is put forth too truly.” Besides, I have stayed</p>

<p>To tire your Royalty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  We are tougher, brother,</p>

<p>Than you can put us to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  No longer stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>One sev’nnight longer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  Very sooth, tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>We’ll part the time between ’s, then, and in that</p>

<p>I’ll no gainsaying.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  Press me not, beseech you, so.</p>

<p>There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’</p>

<p>world,</p>

<p>So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,</p>

<p>Were there necessity in your request, although</p>

<p>’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs</p>

<p>Do even drag me homeward, which to hinder</p>

<p>Were in your love a whip to me, my stay</p>

<p>To you a charge and trouble. To save both,</p>

<p>Farewell, our brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Tongue-tied, our queen?</p>

<p>Speak you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span></p>

<p>I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until</p>

<p>You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,</p>

<p>Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure</p>

<p>All in Bohemia’s well. This satisfaction</p>

<p>The bygone day proclaimed. Say this to him,</p>

<p>He’s beat from his best ward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Well said, Hermione.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span></p>

<p>To tell he longs to see his son were strong.</p>

<p>But let him say so then, and let him go.</p>

<p>But let him swear so and he shall not stay;</p>

<p>We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.</p>

<p><i>[To Polixenes.]</i> Yet of your royal presence I’ll</p>

<p>adventure</p>

<p>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia</p>

<p>You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission</p>

<p>To let him there a month behind the gest</p>

<p>Prefixed for ’s parting.–Yet, good deed, Leontes,</p>

<p>I love thee not a jar o’ th’ clock behind</p>

<p>What lady she her lord.–You’ll stay?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  No, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span></p>

<p>Nay, but you will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  I may not, verily.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  Verily?</p>

<p>You put me off with limber vows. But I,</p>

<p>Though you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with</p>

<p>oaths,</p>

<p>Should yet say “Sir, no going.” Verily,</p>

<p>You shall not go. A lady’s “verily” is</p>

<p>As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?</p>

<p>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,</p>

<p>Not like a guest, so you shall pay your fees</p>

<p>When you depart and save your thanks. How say you?</p>

<p>My prisoner or my guest? By your dread “verily,”</p>

<p>One of them you shall be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  Your guest, then, madam.</p>

<p>To be your prisoner should import offending,</p>

<p>Which is for me less easy to commit</p>

<p>Than you to punish.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  Not your jailer, then,</p>

<p>But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you</p>

<p>Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.</p>

<p>You were pretty lordings then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  We were, fair queen,</p>

<p>Two lads that thought there was no more behind</p>

<p>But such a day tomorrow as today,</p>

<p>And to be boy eternal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  Was not my lord</p>

<p>The verier wag o’ th’ two?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span></p>

<p>We were as twinned lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun</p>

<p>And bleat the one at th’ other. What we changed</p>

<p>Was innocence for innocence. We knew not</p>

<p>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dreamed</p>

<p>That any did. Had we pursued that life,</p>

<p>And our weak spirits ne’er been higher reared</p>

<p>With stronger blood, we should have answered</p>

<p>heaven</p>

<p>Boldly “Not guilty,” the imposition cleared</p>

<p>Hereditary ours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  By this we gather</p>

<p>You have tripped since.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  O my most sacred lady,</p>

<p>Temptations have since then been born to ’s, for</p>

<p>In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;</p>

<p>Your precious self had then not crossed the eyes</p>

<p>Of my young playfellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  Grace to boot!</p>

<p>Of this make no conclusion, lest you say</p>

<p>Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on.</p>

<p>Th’ offenses we have made you do we’ll answer,</p>

<p>If you first sinned with us, and that with us</p>

<p>You did continue fault, and that you slipped not</p>

<p>With any but with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Is he won yet?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span></p>

<p>He’ll stay, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  At my request he would not.</p>

<p>Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st</p>

<p>To better purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  Never?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Never but once.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span></p>

<p>What, have I twice said well? When was ’t before?</p>

<p>I prithee tell me. Cram ’s with praise, and make ’s</p>

<p>As fat as tame things. One good deed dying</p>

<p>tongueless</p>

<p>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</p>

<p>Our praises are our wages. You may ride ’s</p>

<p>With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere</p>

<p>With spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal:</p>

<p>My last good deed was to entreat his stay.</p>

<p>What was my first? It has an elder sister,</p>

<p>Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!</p>

<p>But once before I spoke to th’ purpose? When?</p>

<p>Nay, let me have ’t; I long.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Why, that was when</p>

<p>Three crabbed months had soured themselves to</p>

<p>death</p>

<p>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand</p>

<p>And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter</p>

<p>“I am yours forever.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  ’Tis grace indeed.</p>

<p>Why, lo you now, I have spoke to th’ purpose twice.</p>

<p>The one forever earned a royal husband,</p>

<p>Th’ other for some while a friend.</p>

<p><center><i>[She gives Polixenes her hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Too hot, too hot!</p>

<p>To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.</p>

<p>I have tremor cordis on me. My heart dances,</p>

<p>But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment</p>

<p>May a free face put on, derive a liberty</p>

<p>From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,</p>

<p>And well become the agent. ’T may, I grant.</p>

<p>But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,</p>

<p>As now they are, and making practiced smiles</p>

<p>As in a looking glass, and then to sigh, as ’twere</p>

<p>The mort o’ th’ deer–O, that is entertainment</p>

<p>My bosom likes not, nor my brows.–Mamillius,</p>

<p>Art thou my boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mamillius</span>  Ay, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  I’ fecks!</p>

<p>Why, that’s my bawcock. What, hast smutched thy</p>

<p>nose?</p>

<p>They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,</p>

<p>We must be neat–not neat, but cleanly, captain.</p>

<p>And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf</p>

<p>Are all called neat.–Still virginalling</p>

<p>Upon his palm?–How now, you wanton calf?</p>

<p>Art thou my calf?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mamillius</span>  Yes, if you will, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I</p>

<p>have</p>

<p>To be full like me; yet they say we are</p>

<p>Almost as like as eggs. Women say so,</p>

<p>That will say anything. But were they false</p>

<p>As o’erdyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false</p>

<p>As dice are to be wished by one that fixes</p>

<p>No bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true</p>

<p>To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,</p>

<p>Look on me with your welkin eye. Sweet villain,</p>

<p>Most dear’st, my collop! Can thy dam?–may ’t</p>

<p>be?–</p>

<p>Affection, thy intention stabs the center.</p>

<p>Thou dost make possible things not so held,</p>

<p>Communicat’st with dreams–how can this be?</p>

<p>With what’s unreal thou coactive art,</p>

<p>And fellow’st nothing. Then ’tis very credent</p>

<p>Thou may’st co-join with something; and thou dost,</p>

<p>And that beyond commission, and I find it,</p>

<p>And that to the infection of my brains</p>

<p>And hard’ning of my brows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  What means Sicilia?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span></p>

<p>He something seems unsettled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  How, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>What cheer? How is ’t with you, best brother?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  You look</p>

<p>As if you held a brow of much distraction.</p>

<p>Are you moved, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  No, in good earnest.</p>

<p>How sometimes nature will betray its folly,</p>

<p>Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime</p>

<p>To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines</p>

<p>Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil</p>

<p>Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreeched,</p>

<p>In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled</p>

<p>Lest it should bite its master and so prove,</p>

<p>As ornaments oft do, too dangerous.</p>

<p>How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,</p>

<p>This squash, this gentleman.–Mine honest friend,</p>

<p>Will you take eggs for money?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mamillius</span>  No, my lord, I’ll fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>You will? Why, happy man be ’s dole!–My brother,</p>

<p>Are you so fond of your young prince as we</p>

<p>Do seem to be of ours?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  If at home, sir,</p>

<p>He’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,</p>

<p>Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,</p>

<p>My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.</p>

<p>He makes a July’s day short as December,</p>

<p>And with his varying childness cures in me</p>

<p>Thoughts that would thick my blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  So stands this</p>

<p>squire</p>

<p>Officed with me. We two will walk, my lord,</p>

<p>And leave you to your graver steps.–Hermione,</p>

<p>How thou lov’st us show in our brother’s welcome.</p>

<p>Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap.</p>

<p>Next to thyself and my young rover, he’s</p>

<p>Apparent to my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermione</span>  If you would seek us,</p>

<p>We are yours i’ th’ garden. Shall ’s attend you there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>To your own bents dispose you. You’ll be found,</p>

<p>Be you beneath the sky. <i>[Aside.]</i> I am angling now,</p>

<p>Though you perceive me not how I give line.</p>

<p>Go to, go to!</p>

<p>How she holds up the neb, the bill to him,</p>

<p>And arms her with the boldness of a wife</p>

<p>To her allowing husband!</p>

<p><center><i>[Exit Hermione, Polixenes, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<p>Gone already.</p>

<p>Inch thick, knee-deep, o’er head and ears a forked</p>

<p>one!–</p>

<p>Go play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I</p>

<p>Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue</p>

<p>Will hiss me to my grave. Contempt and clamor</p>

<p>Will be my knell. Go play, boy, play.–There have</p>

<p>been,</p>

<p>Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;</p>

<p>And many a man there is, even at this present,</p>

<p>Now while I speak this, holds his wife by th’ arm,</p>

<p>That little thinks she has been sluiced in ’s absence,</p>

<p>And his pond fished by his next neighbor, by</p>

<p>Sir Smile, his neighbor. Nay, there’s comfort in ’t</p>

<p>Whiles other men have gates and those gates</p>

<p>opened,</p>

<p>As mine, against their will. Should all despair</p>

<p>That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind</p>

<p>Would hang themselves. Physic for ’t there’s none.</p>

<p>It is a bawdy planet, that will strike</p>

<p>Where ’tis predominant; and ’tis powerful, think it,</p>

<p>From east, west, north, and south. Be it concluded,</p>

<p>No barricado for a belly. Know ’t,</p>

<p>It will let in and out the enemy</p>

<p>With bag and baggage. Many thousand on ’s</p>

<p>Have the disease and feel ’t not.–How now, boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mamillius</span></p>

<p>I am like you, they say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Why, that’s some comfort.–</p>

<p>What, Camillo there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span> <i>[coming forward]</i>  Ay, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>Go play, Mamillius. Thou ’rt an honest man.</p>

<p><center><i>[Mamillius exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span></p>

<p>You had much ado to make his anchor hold.</p>

<p>When you cast out, it still came home.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Didst note it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span></p>

<p>He would not stay at your petitions, made</p>

<p>His business more material.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Didst perceive it?</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> They’re here with me already, whisp’ring,</p>

<p>rounding:</p>

<p>“Sicilia is a so-forth.” ’Tis far gone</p>

<p>When I shall gust it last.–How came ’t, Camillo,</p>

<p>That he did stay?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  At the good queen’s entreaty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>“At the queen’s” be ’t. “Good” should be pertinent,</p>

<p>But so it is, it is not. Was this taken</p>

<p>By any understanding pate but thine?</p>

<p>For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in</p>

<p>More than the common blocks. Not noted, is ’t,</p>

<p>But of the finer natures, by some severals</p>

<p>Of headpiece extraordinary? Lower messes</p>

<p>Perchance are to this business purblind? Say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span></p>

<p>Business, my lord? I think most understand</p>

<p>Bohemia stays here longer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>Ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  Stays here longer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Ay, but why?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span></p>

<p>To satisfy your Highness and the entreaties</p>

<p>Of our most gracious mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Satisfy?</p>

<p>Th’ entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy?</p>

<p>Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,</p>

<p>With all the nearest things to my heart, as well</p>

<p>My chamber-counsels, wherein, priestlike, thou</p>

<p>Hast cleansed my bosom; I from thee departed</p>

<p>Thy penitent reformed. But we have been</p>

<p>Deceived in thy integrity, deceived</p>

<p>In that which seems so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  Be it forbid, my lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>To bide upon ’t: thou art not honest; or,</p>

<p>If thou inclin’st that way, thou art a coward,</p>

<p>Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining</p>

<p>From course required; or else thou must be</p>

<p>counted</p>

<p>A servant grafted in my serious trust</p>

<p>And therein negligent; or else a fool</p>

<p>That seest a game played home, the rich stake</p>

<p>drawn,</p>

<p>And tak’st it all for jest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  My gracious lord,</p>

<p>I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful.</p>

<p>In every one of these no man is free,</p>

<p>But that his negligence, his folly, fear,</p>

<p>Among the infinite doings of the world,</p>

<p>Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,</p>

<p>If ever I were willful-negligent,</p>

<p>It was my folly; if industriously</p>

<p>I played the fool, it was my negligence,</p>

<p>Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful</p>

<p>To do a thing where I the issue doubted,</p>

<p>Whereof the execution did cry out</p>

<p>Against the non-performance, ’twas a fear</p>

<p>Which oft infects the wisest. These, my lord,</p>

<p>Are such allowed infirmities that honesty</p>

<p>Is never free of. But, beseech your Grace,</p>

<p>Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass</p>

<p>By its own visage. If I then deny it,</p>

<p>’Tis none of mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Ha’ not you seen, Camillo–</p>

<p>But that’s past doubt; you have, or your eyeglass</p>

<p>Is thicker than a cuckold’s horn–or heard–</p>

<p>For to a vision so apparent, rumor</p>

<p>Cannot be mute–or thought–for cogitation</p>

<p>Resides not in that man that does not think–</p>

<p>My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess–</p>

<p>Or else be impudently negative</p>

<p>To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought–then say</p>

<p>My wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name</p>

<p>As rank as any flax-wench that puts to</p>

<p>Before her troth-plight. Say ’t, and justify ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span></p>

<p>I would not be a stander-by to hear</p>

<p>My sovereign mistress clouded so without</p>

<p>My present vengeance taken. ’Shrew my heart,</p>

<p>You never spoke what did become you less</p>

<p>Than this, which to reiterate were sin</p>

<p>As deep as that, though true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Is whispering nothing?</p>

<p>Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?</p>

<p>Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career</p>

<p>Of laughter with a sigh?–a note infallible</p>

<p>Of breaking honesty. Horsing foot on foot?</p>

<p>Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?</p>

<p>Hours minutes? Noon midnight? And all eyes</p>

<p>Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,</p>

<p>That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?</p>

<p>Why, then the world and all that’s in ’t is nothing,</p>

<p>The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,</p>

<p>My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,</p>

<p>If this be nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  Good my lord, be cured</p>

<p>Of this diseased opinion, and betimes,</p>

<p>For ’tis most dangerous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Say it be, ’tis true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span></p>

<p>No, no, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  It is. You lie, you lie.</p>

<p>I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,</p>

<p>Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,</p>

<p>Or else a hovering temporizer that</p>

<p>Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,</p>

<p>Inclining to them both. Were my wife’s liver</p>

<p>Infected as her life, she would not live</p>

<p>The running of one glass.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  Who does infect her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging</p>

<p>About his neck–Bohemia, who, if I</p>

<p>Had servants true about me, that bare eyes</p>

<p>To see alike mine honor as their profits,</p>

<p>Their own particular thrifts, they would do that</p>

<p>Which should undo more doing. Ay, and thou,</p>

<p>His cupbearer–whom I from meaner form</p>

<p>Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see</p>

<p>Plainly as heaven sees Earth and Earth sees heaven</p>

<p>How I am galled–mightst bespice a cup</p>

<p>To give mine enemy a lasting wink,</p>

<p>Which draft to me were cordial.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  Sir, my lord,</p>

<p>I could do this, and that with no rash potion,</p>

<p>But with a ling’ring dram that should not work</p>

<p>Maliciously like poison. But I cannot</p>

<p>Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,</p>

<p>So sovereignly being honorable. I have loved thee–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Make that thy question, and go rot!</p>

<p>Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,</p>

<p>To appoint myself in this vexation, sully</p>

<p>The purity and whiteness of my sheets–</p>

<p>Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted</p>

<p>Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps–</p>

<p>Give scandal to the blood o’ th’ Prince, my son,</p>

<p>Who I do think is mine and love as mine,</p>

<p>Without ripe moving to ’t? Would I do this?</p>

<p>Could man so blench?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  I must believe you, sir.</p>

<p>I do, and will fetch off Bohemia for ’t–</p>

<p>Provided that, when he’s removed, your Highness</p>

<p>Will take again your queen as yours at first,</p>

<p>Even for your son’s sake, and thereby for sealing</p>

<p>The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms</p>

<p>Known and allied to yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  Thou dost advise me</p>

<p>Even so as I mine own course have set down.</p>

<p>I’ll give no blemish to her honor, none.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  My lord,</p>

<p>Go then, and with a countenance as clear</p>

<p>As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia</p>

<p>And with your queen. I am his cupbearer.</p>

<p>If from me he have wholesome beverage,</p>

<p>Account me not your servant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span>  This is all.</p>

<p>Do ’t and thou hast the one half of my heart;</p>

<p>Do ’t not, thou splitt’st thine own.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  I’ll do ’t, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leontes</span></p>

<p>I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span></p>

<p>O miserable lady! But, for me,</p>

<p>What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner</p>

<p>Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do ’t</p>

<p>Is the obedience to a master, one</p>

<p>Who in rebellion with himself will have</p>

<p>All that are his so too. To do this deed,</p>

<p>Promotion follows. If I could find example</p>

<p>Of thousands that had struck anointed kings</p>

<p>And flourished after, I’d not do ’t. But since</p>

<p>Nor brass, nor stone, nor parchment bears not one,</p>

<p>Let villainy itself forswear ’t. I must</p>

<p>Forsake the court. To do ’t or no is certain</p>

<p>To me a breakneck. Happy star reign now!</p>

<p>Here comes Bohemia.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Polixenes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span> <i>[aside]</i>  This is strange. Methinks</p>

<p>My favor here begins to warp. Not speak?–</p>

<p>Good day, Camillo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  Hail, most royal sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span></p>

<p>What is the news i’ th’ court?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  None rare, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span></p>

<p>The King hath on him such a countenance</p>

<p>As he had lost some province and a region</p>

<p>Loved as he loves himself. Even now I met him</p>

<p>With customary compliment, when he,</p>

<p>Wafting his eyes to th’ contrary and falling</p>

<p>A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and</p>

<p>So leaves me to consider what is breeding</p>

<p>That changes thus his manners.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  I dare not know, my</p>

<p>lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span></p>

<p>How, dare not? Do not? Do you know and dare not?</p>

<p>Be intelligent to me–’tis thereabouts;</p>

<p>For to yourself what you do know, you must,</p>

<p>And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,</p>

<p>Your changed complexions are to me a mirror</p>

<p>Which shows me mine changed too, for I must be</p>

<p>A party in this alteration, finding</p>

<p>Myself thus altered with ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  There is a sickness</p>

<p>Which puts some of us in distemper, but</p>

<p>I cannot name the disease, and it is caught</p>

<p>Of you that yet are well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  How caught of me?</p>

<p>Make me not sighted like the basilisk.</p>

<p>I have looked on thousands who have sped the</p>

<p>better</p>

<p>By my regard, but killed none so. Camillo,</p>

<p>As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto</p>

<p>Clerklike experienced, which no less adorns</p>

<p>Our gentry than our parents’ noble names,</p>

<p>In whose success we are gentle, I beseech you,</p>

<p>If you know aught which does behoove my</p>

<p>knowledge</p>

<p>Thereof to be informed, imprison ’t not</p>

<p>In ignorant concealment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  I may not answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span></p>

<p>A sickness caught of me, and yet I well?</p>

<p>I must be answered. Dost thou hear, Camillo?</p>

<p>I conjure thee by all the parts of man</p>

<p>Which honor does acknowledge, whereof the least</p>

<p>Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare</p>

<p>What incidency thou dost guess of harm</p>

<p>Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;</p>

<p>Which way to be prevented, if to be;</p>

<p>If not, how best to bear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  Sir, I will tell you,</p>

<p>Since I am charged in honor and by him</p>

<p>That I think honorable. Therefore mark my counsel,</p>

<p>Which must be e’en as swiftly followed as</p>

<p>I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me</p>

<p>Cry lost, and so goodnight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  On, good Camillo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span></p>

<p>I am appointed him to murder you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span></p>

<p>By whom, Camillo?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  By the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  For what?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span></p>

<p>He thinks, nay with all confidence he swears,</p>

<p>As he had seen ’t or been an instrument</p>

<p>To vice you to ’t, that you have touched his queen</p>

<p>Forbiddenly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  O, then my best blood turn</p>

<p>To an infected jelly, and my name</p>

<p>Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!</p>

<p>Turn then my freshest reputation to</p>

<p>A savor that may strike the dullest nostril</p>

<p>Where I arrive, and my approach be shunned,</p>

<p>Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection</p>

<p>That e’er was heard or read.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span>  Swear his thought over</p>

<p>By each particular star in heaven and</p>

<p>By all their influences, you may as well</p>

<p>Forbid the sea for to obey the moon</p>

<p>As or by oath remove or counsel shake</p>

<p>The fabric of his folly, whose foundation</p>

<p>Is piled upon his faith and will continue</p>

<p>The standing of his body.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  How should this grow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span></p>

<p>I know not. But I am sure ’tis safer to</p>

<p>Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born.</p>

<p>If therefore you dare trust my honesty,</p>

<p>That lies enclosed in this trunk which you</p>

<p>Shall bear along impawned, away tonight!</p>

<p>Your followers I will whisper to the business,</p>

<p>And will by twos and threes at several posterns</p>

<p>Clear them o’ th’ city. For myself, I’ll put</p>

<p>My fortunes to your service, which are here</p>

<p>By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,</p>

<p>For, by the honor of my parents, I</p>

<p>Have uttered truth–which if you seek to prove,</p>

<p>I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer</p>

<p>Than one condemned by the King’s own mouth,</p>

<p>thereon</p>

<p>His execution sworn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polixenes</span>  I do believe thee.</p>

<p>I saw his heart in ’s face. Give me thy hand.</p>

<p>Be pilot to me and thy places shall</p>

<p>Still neighbor mine. My ships are ready and</p>

<p>My people did expect my hence departure</p>

<p>Two days ago. This jealousy</p>

<p>Is for a precious creature. As she’s rare,</p>

<p>Must it be great; and as his person’s mighty,</p>

<p>Must it be violent; and as he does conceive</p>

<p>He is dishonored by a man which ever</p>

<p>Professed to him, why, his revenges must</p>

<p>In that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me.</p>

<p>Good expedition be my friend, and comfort</p>

<p>The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing</p>

<p>Of his ill-ta’en suspicion. Come, Camillo,</p>

<p>I will respect thee as a father if</p>

<p>Thou bear’st my life off hence. Let us avoid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Camillo</span></p>

<p>It is in mine authority to command</p>

<p>The keys of all the posterns. Please your Highness</p>

<p>To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.</p>
