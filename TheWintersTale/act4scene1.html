<br/>

<p><sc>Time</sc></p>

<p>I, that please some, try all–both joy and terror</p>

<p>Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error–</p>

<p>Now take upon me, in the name of Time,</p>

<p>To use my wings. Impute it not a crime</p>

<p>To me or my swift passage that I slide</p>

<p>O’er sixteen years, and leave the growth untried</p>

<p>Of that wide gap, since it is in my power</p>

<p>To o’erthrow law and in one self-born hour</p>

<p>To plant and o’erwhelm custom. Let me pass</p>

<p>The same I am ere ancient’st order was</p>

<p>Or what is now received. I witness to</p>

<p>The times that brought them in. So shall I do</p>

<p>To th’ freshest things now reigning, and make stale</p>

<p>The glistering of this present, as my tale</p>

<p>Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,</p>

<p>I turn my glass and give my scene such growing</p>

<p>As you had slept between. Leontes leaving,</p>

<p>Th’ effects of his fond jealousies so grieving</p>

<p>That he shuts up himself, imagine me,</p>

<p>Gentle spectators, that I now may be</p>

<p>In fair Bohemia. And remember well</p>

<p>I mentioned a son o’ th’ King’s, which Florizell</p>

<p>I now name to you, and with speed so pace</p>

<p>To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace</p>

<p>Equal with wond’ring. What of her ensues</p>

<p>I list not prophesy; but let Time’s news</p>

<p>Be known when ’tis brought forth. A shepherd’s</p>

<p>daughter</p>

<p>And what to her adheres, which follows after,</p>

<p>Is th’ argument of Time. Of this allow,</p>

<p>If ever you have spent time worse ere now.</p>

<p>If never, yet that Time himself doth say</p>

<p>He wishes earnestly you never may.</p>
