<p><center><i>[Enter Florizell and Perdita.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc></p>

<p>These your unusual weeds to each part of you</p>

<p>Does give a life–no shepherdess, but Flora</p>

<p>Peering in April’s front. This your sheep-shearing</p>

<p>Is as a meeting of the petty gods,</p>

<p>And you the queen on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  Sir, my gracious lord,</p>

<p>To chide at your extremes it not becomes me;</p>

<p>O, pardon that I name them! Your high self,</p>

<p>The gracious mark o’ th’ land, you have obscured</p>

<p>With a swain’s wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,</p>

<p>Most goddesslike pranked up. But that our feasts</p>

<p>In every mess have folly, and the feeders</p>

<p>Digest it with a custom, I should blush</p>

<p>To see you so attired, swoon, I think,</p>

<p>To show myself a glass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  I bless the time</p>

<p>When my good falcon made her flight across</p>

<p>Thy father’s ground.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  Now Jove afford you cause.</p>

<p>To me the difference forges dread. Your greatness</p>

<p>Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble</p>

<p>To think your father by some accident</p>

<p>Should pass this way as you did. O the Fates,</p>

<p>How would he look to see his work, so noble,</p>

<p>Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how</p>

<p>Should I, in these my borrowed flaunts, behold</p>

<p>The sternness of his presence?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Apprehend</p>

<p>Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,</p>

<p>Humbling their deities to love, have taken</p>

<p>The shapes of beasts upon them. Jupiter</p>

<p>Became a bull, and bellowed; the green Neptune</p>

<p>A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,</p>

<p>Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,</p>

<p>As I seem now. Their transformations</p>

<p>Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,</p>

<p>Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires</p>

<p>Run not before mine honor, nor my lusts</p>

<p>Burn hotter than my faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  O, but sir,</p>

<p>Your resolution cannot hold when ’tis</p>

<p>Opposed, as it must be, by th’ power of the King.</p>

<p>One of these two must be necessities,</p>

<p>Which then will speak: that you must change this</p>

<p>purpose</p>

<p>Or I my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Thou dear’st Perdita,</p>

<p>With these forced thoughts I prithee darken not</p>

<p>The mirth o’ th’ feast. Or I’ll be thine, my fair,</p>

<p>Or not my father’s. For I cannot be</p>

<p>Mine own, nor anything to any, if</p>

<p>I be not thine. To this I am most constant,</p>

<p>Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle.</p>

<p>Strangle such thoughts as these with anything</p>

<p>That you behold the while. Your guests are coming.</p>

<p>Lift up your countenance as it were the day</p>

<p>Of celebration of that nuptial which</p>

<p>We two have sworn shall come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  O Lady Fortune,</p>

<p>Stand you auspicious!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  See, your guests approach.</p>

<p>Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,</p>

<p>And let’s be red with mirth.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Shepherd, Shepherd’s Son, Mopsa, Dorcas,</p>

<p>Shepherds and Shepherdesses, Servants, Musicians,</p>

<p>and Polixenes and Camillo in disguise.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc></p>

<p>Fie, daughter, when my old wife lived, upon</p>

<p>This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,</p>

<p>Both dame and servant; welcomed all; served all;</p>

<p>Would sing her song and dance her turn, now here</p>

<p>At upper end o’ th’ table, now i’ th’ middle;</p>

<p>On his shoulder, and his; her face afire</p>

<p>With labor, and the thing she took to quench it</p>

<p>She would to each one sip. You are retired</p>

<p>As if you were a feasted one and not</p>

<p>The hostess of the meeting. Pray you bid</p>

<p>These unknown friends to ’s welcome, for it is</p>

<p>A way to make us better friends, more known.</p>

<p>Come, quench your blushes and present yourself</p>

<p>That which you are, mistress o’ th’ feast. Come on,</p>

<p>And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,</p>

<p>As your good flock shall prosper.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc> <i>[to Polixenes]</i>  Sir, welcome.</p>

<p>It is my father’s will I should take on me</p>

<p>The hostess-ship o’ th’ day. <i>[To Camillo.]</i> You’re</p>

<p>welcome, sir.–</p>

<p>Give me those flowers there, Dorcas.–Reverend</p>

<p>sirs,</p>

<p>For you there’s rosemary and rue. These keep</p>

<p>Seeming and savor all the winter long.</p>

<p>Grace and remembrance be to you both,</p>

<p>And welcome to our shearing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc>  Shepherdess–</p>

<p>A fair one are you–well you fit our ages</p>

<p>With flowers of winter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  Sir, the year growing ancient,</p>

<p>Not yet on summer’s death nor on the birth</p>

<p>Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o’ th’ season</p>

<p>Are our carnations and streaked gillyvors,</p>

<p>Which some call nature’s bastards. Of that kind</p>

<p>Our rustic garden’s barren, and I care not</p>

<p>To get slips of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc>  Wherefore, gentle maiden,</p>

<p>Do you neglect them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  For I have heard it said</p>

<p>There is an art which in their piedness shares</p>

<p>With great creating nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc>  Say there be;</p>

<p>Yet nature is made better by no mean</p>

<p>But nature makes that mean. So, over that art</p>

<p>Which you say adds to nature is an art</p>

<p>That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry</p>

<p>A gentler scion to the wildest stock,</p>

<p>And make conceive a bark of baser kind</p>

<p>By bud of nobler race. This is an art</p>

<p>Which does mend nature, change it rather, but</p>

<p>The art itself is nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  So it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc></p>

<p>Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,</p>

<p>And do not call them bastards.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  I’ll not put</p>

<p>The dibble in earth to set one slip of them,</p>

<p>No more than, were I painted, I would wish</p>

<p>This youth should say ’twere well, and only</p>

<p>therefore</p>

<p>Desire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you:</p>

<p>Hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram,</p>

<p>The marigold, that goes to bed wi’ th’ sun</p>

<p>And with him rises weeping. These are flowers</p>

<p>Of middle summer, and I think they are given</p>

<p>To men of middle age. You’re very welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc></p>

<p>I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,</p>

<p>And only live by gazing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  Out, alas!</p>

<p>You’d be so lean that blasts of January</p>

<p>Would blow you through and through. <i>[(To</p>

<p>Florizell.)]</i> Now, my fair’st friend,</p>

<p>I would I had some flowers o’ th’ spring, that might</p>

<p>Become your time of day, <i>[(to the Shepherdesses)]</i></p>

<p>and yours, and yours,</p>

<p>That wear upon your virgin branches yet</p>

<p>Your maidenheads growing. O Proserpina,</p>

<p>For the flowers now that, frighted, thou let’st fall</p>

<p>From Dis’s wagon! Daffodils,</p>

<p>That come before the swallow dares, and take</p>

<p>The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,</p>

<p>But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes</p>

<p>Or Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses,</p>

<p>That die unmarried ere they can behold</p>

<p>Bright Phoebus in his strength–a malady</p>

<p>Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and</p>

<p>The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,</p>

<p>The flower-de-luce being one–O, these I lack</p>

<p>To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,</p>

<p>To strew him o’er and o’er.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  What, like a corse?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc></p>

<p>No, like a bank for love to lie and play on,</p>

<p>Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,</p>

<p>But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your</p>

<p>flowers.</p>

<p>Methinks I play as I have seen them do</p>

<p>In Whitsun pastorals. Sure this robe of mine</p>

<p>Does change my disposition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  What you do</p>

<p>Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,</p>

<p>I’d have you do it ever. When you sing,</p>

<p>I’d have you buy and sell so, so give alms,</p>

<p>Pray so; and for the ord’ring your affairs,</p>

<p>To sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you</p>

<p>A wave o’ th’ sea, that you might ever do</p>

<p>Nothing but that, move still, still so,</p>

<p>And own no other function. Each your doing,</p>

<p>So singular in each particular,</p>

<p>Crowns what you are doing in the present deeds,</p>

<p>That all your acts are queens.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  O Doricles,</p>

<p>Your praises are too large. But that your youth</p>

<p>And the true blood which peeps fairly through ’t</p>

<p>Do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd,</p>

<p>With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,</p>

<p>You wooed me the false way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  I think you have</p>

<p>As little skill to fear as I have purpose</p>

<p>To put you to ’t. But come, our dance, I pray.</p>

<p>Your hand, my Perdita. So turtles pair</p>

<p>That never mean to part.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  I’ll swear for ’em.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc> <i>[to Camillo]</i></p>

<p>This is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever</p>

<p>Ran on the greensward. Nothing she does or seems</p>

<p>But smacks of something greater than herself,</p>

<p>Too noble for this place.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  He tells her something</p>

<p>That makes her blood look out. Good sooth, she is</p>

<p>The queen of curds and cream.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc> <i>[to Musicians]</i>  Come on, strike up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorcas</sc></p>

<p>Mopsa must be your mistress? Marry, garlic</p>

<p>To mend her kissing with.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc>  Now, in good time!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc></p>

<p>Not a word, a word. We stand upon our manners.–</p>

<p>Come, strike up. <i>[Music begins.]</i></p>

<p><center><i>[Here a Dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc></p>

<p>Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this</p>

<p>Which dances with your daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc></p>

<p>They call him Doricles, and boasts himself</p>

<p>To have a worthy feeding. But I have it</p>

<p>Upon his own report, and I believe it.</p>

<p>He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter.</p>

<p>I think so too, for never gazed the moon</p>

<p>Upon the water as he’ll stand and read,</p>

<p>As ’twere, my daughter’s eyes. And, to be plain,</p>

<p>I think there is not half a kiss to choose</p>

<p>Who loves another best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc>  She dances featly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc></p>

<p>So she does anything, though I report it</p>

<p>That should be silent. If young Doricles</p>

<p>Do light upon her, she shall bring him that</p>

<p>Which he not dreams of.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  O, master, if you did but hear the peddler at</p>

<p>the door, you would never dance again after a tabor</p>

<p>and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you. He</p>

<p>sings several tunes faster than you’ll tell money. He</p>

<p>utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men’s</p>

<p>ears grew to his tunes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  He could never come better. He shall</p>

<p>come in. I love a ballad but even too well if it be</p>

<p>doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant</p>

<p>thing indeed and sung lamentably.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes.</p>

<p>No milliner can so fit his customers with gloves. He</p>

<p>has the prettiest love songs for maids, so without</p>

<p>bawdry, which is strange, with such delicate burdens</p>

<p>of dildos and fadings, “Jump her and thump</p>

<p>her.” And where some stretch-mouthed rascal</p>

<p>would, as it were, mean mischief and break a foul</p>

<p>gap into the matter, he makes the maid to answer</p>

<p>“Whoop, do me no harm, good man”; puts him off,</p>

<p>slights him, with “Whoop, do me no harm, good</p>

<p>man.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc>  This is a brave fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable</p>

<p>conceited fellow. Has he any unbraided</p>

<p>wares?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  He hath ribbons of all the colors i’ th’ rainbow;</p>

<p>points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia</p>

<p>can learnedly handle, though they come to him by</p>

<p>th’ gross; inkles, caddises, cambrics, lawns–why,</p>

<p>he sings ’em over as they were gods or goddesses.</p>

<p>You would think a smock were a she-angel, he so</p>

<p>chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the</p>

<p>square on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  Prithee bring him in, and let him</p>

<p>approach singing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words</p>

<p>in ’s tunes.     <i><i>[Servant exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  You have of these peddlers that have</p>

<p>more in them than you’d think, sister.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  Ay, good brother, or go about to think.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Autolycus, wearing a false beard, singing.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Lawn as white as driven snow,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Cypress black as e’er was crow,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Gloves as sweet as damask roses,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Masks for faces and for noses,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Perfume for a lady’s chamber,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Golden coifs and stomachers</i></p>

<p>     <i>For my lads to give their dears,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Pins and poking-sticks of steel,</i></p>

<p>     <i>What maids lack from head to heel,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Come buy of me, come. Come buy, come buy.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Buy, lads, or else your lasses cry.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Come buy.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou</p>

<p>shouldst take no money of me; but being enthralled</p>

<p>as I am, it will also be the bondage of certain</p>

<p>ribbons and gloves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc>  I was promised them against the feast, but they</p>

<p>come not too late now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorcas</sc>  He hath promised you more than that, or there</p>

<p>be liars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc>  He hath paid you all he promised you. Maybe</p>

<p>he has paid you more, which will shame you to give</p>

<p>him again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  Is there no manners left among</p>

<p>maids? Will they wear their plackets where they</p>

<p>should bear their faces? Is there not milking time,</p>

<p>when you are going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle</p>

<p>of these secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling</p>

<p>before all our guests? ’Tis well they are whisp’ring.</p>

<p>Clamor your tongues, and not a word more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc>  I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry</p>

<p>lace and a pair of sweet gloves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  Have I not told thee how I was cozened</p>

<p>by the way and lost all my money?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;</p>

<p>therefore it behooves men to be wary.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  Fear not thou, man. Thou shalt lose</p>

<p>nothing here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  I hope so, sir, for I have about me many</p>

<p>parcels of charge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  What hast here? Ballads?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc>  Pray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print</p>

<p>alife, for then we are sure they are true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Here’s one to a very doleful tune, how a</p>

<p>usurer’s wife was brought to bed of twenty moneybags</p>

<p>at a burden, and how she longed to eat adders’</p>

<p>heads and toads carbonadoed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc>  Is it true, think you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Very true, and but a month old.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorcas</sc>  Bless me from marrying a usurer!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Here’s the midwife’s name to ’t, one Mistress</p>

<p>Taleporter, and five or six honest wives that</p>

<p>were present. Why should I carry lies abroad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc> <i>[to Shepherd’s Son]</i>  Pray you now, buy it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc> <i>[to Autolycus]</i>  Come on, lay it by, and</p>

<p>let’s first see more ballads. We’ll buy the other</p>

<p>things anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Here’s another ballad, of a fish that appeared</p>

<p>upon the coast on Wednesday the fourscore</p>

<p>of April, forty thousand fathom above water, and</p>

<p>sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids. It</p>

<p>was thought she was a woman, and was turned into</p>

<p>a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with</p>

<p>one that loved her. The ballad is very pitiful, and as</p>

<p>true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorcas</sc>  Is it true too, think you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Five justices’ hands at it, and witnesses</p>

<p>more than my pack will hold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  Lay it by too. Another.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty</p>

<p>one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc>  Let’s have some merry ones.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Why, this is a passing merry one and goes</p>

<p>to the tune of “Two Maids Wooing a Man.” There’s</p>

<p>scarce a maid westward but she sings it. ’Tis in</p>

<p>request, I can tell you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc>  We can both sing it. If thou ’lt bear a part, thou</p>

<p>shalt hear; ’tis in three parts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorcas</sc>  We had the tune on ’t a month ago.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  I can bear my part. You must know ’tis my</p>

<p>occupation. Have at it with you.</p>

<br/>

<p>Song.</p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>     <i>Get you hence, for I must go</i></p>

<p>     <i>Where it fits not you to know.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorcas</sc>        <i>Whither?</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc>     <i>O, whither?</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorcas</sc>     <i>Whither?</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc>     <i>It becomes thy oath full well</i></p>

<p>     <i>Thou to me thy secrets tell.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorcas</sc>        <i>Me too. Let me go thither.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc>     <i>Or thou goest to th’ grange or mill.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorcas</sc>     <i>If to either, thou dost ill.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>        <i>Neither.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorcas</sc>     <i>What, neither?</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>     <i>Neither.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dorcas</sc>     <i>Thou hast sworn my love to be.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mopsa</sc>     <i>Thou hast sworn it more to me.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Then whither goest? Say whither.</i></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  We’ll have this song out anon by</p>

<p>ourselves. My father and the gentlemen are in sad</p>

<p>talk, and we’ll not trouble them. Come, bring away</p>

<p>thy pack after me.–Wenches, I’ll buy for you</p>

<p>both.–Peddler, let’s have the first choice.–Follow</p>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc> <i>[to Shepherd]</i>   <i>Master, there is three carters,</i></p>

<p>three shepherds, three neatherds, three swineherds,</p>

<p>that have made themselves all men of hair.</p>

<p>They call themselves saultiers, and they have a</p>

<p>dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of</p>

<p>gambols, because they are not in ’t, but they themselves</p>

<p>are o’ th’ mind, if it be not too rough for</p>

<p>some that know little but bowling, it will please</p>

<p>plentifully.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  Away! We’ll none on ’t. Here has been too</p>

<p>much homely foolery already.–I know, sir, we</p>

<p>weary you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc>  You weary those that refresh us. Pray, let’s</p>

<p>see these four threes of herdsmen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  One three of them, by their own report, sir,</p>

<p>hath danced before the King, and not the worst of</p>

<p>the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by th’</p>

<p>square.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  Leave your prating. Since these good men</p>

<p>are pleased, let them come in–but quickly now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  Why, they stay at door, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[He admits the herdsmen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Here a Dance of twelve herdsmen, dressed as Satyrs.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Herdsmen, Musicians, and Servants exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc> <i>[to Shepherd]</i></p>

<p>O father, you’ll know more of that hereafter.</p>

<p><i>[Aside to Camillo.]</i> Is it not too far gone? ’Tis time to</p>

<p>part them.</p>

<p>He’s simple, and tells much. <i>[To Florizell.]</i> How now,</p>

<p>fair shepherd?</p>

<p>Your heart is full of something that does take</p>

<p>Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young</p>

<p>And handed love, as you do, I was wont</p>

<p>To load my she with knacks. I would have ransacked</p>

<p>The peddler’s silken treasury and have poured it</p>

<p>To her acceptance. You have let him go</p>

<p>And nothing marted with him. If your lass</p>

<p>Interpretation should abuse and call this</p>

<p>Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited</p>

<p>For a reply, at least if you make a care</p>

<p>Of happy holding her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Old sir, I know</p>

<p>She prizes not such trifles as these are.</p>

<p>The gifts she looks from me are packed and locked</p>

<p>Up in my heart, which I have given already,</p>

<p>But not delivered. <i>[To Perdita.]</i> O, hear me breathe</p>

<p>my life</p>

<p>Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,</p>

<p>Hath sometime loved. I take thy hand, this hand</p>

<p>As soft as dove’s down and as white as it,</p>

<p>Or Ethiopian’s tooth, or the fanned snow that’s</p>

<p>bolted</p>

<p>By th’ northern blasts twice o’er.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc>  What follows this?–</p>

<p>How prettily th’ young swain seems to wash</p>

<p>The hand was fair before.–I have put you out.</p>

<p>But to your protestation. Let me hear</p>

<p>What you profess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Do, and be witness to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc></p>

<p>And this my neighbor too?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  And he, and more</p>

<p>Than he, and men–the Earth, the heavens, and</p>

<p>all–</p>

<p>That were I crowned the most imperial monarch,</p>

<p>Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth</p>

<p>That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge</p>

<p>More than was ever man’s, I would not prize them</p>

<p>Without her love; for her employ them all,</p>

<p>Commend them and condemn them to her service</p>

<p>Or to their own perdition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc>  Fairly offered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc></p>

<p>This shows a sound affection.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  But my daughter,</p>

<p>Say you the like to him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  I cannot speak</p>

<p>So well, nothing so well, no, nor mean better.</p>

<p>By th’ pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out</p>

<p>The purity of his.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  Take hands, a bargain.–</p>

<p>And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to ’t:</p>

<p>I give my daughter to him and will make</p>

<p>Her portion equal his.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  O, that must be</p>

<p>I’ th’ virtue of your daughter. One being dead,</p>

<p>I shall have more than you can dream of yet,</p>

<p>Enough then for your wonder. But come on,</p>

<p>Contract us fore these witnesses.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  Come, your hand–</p>

<p>And daughter, yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc> <i>[To Florizell]</i>  Soft, swain, awhile, beseech</p>

<p>you.</p>

<p>Have you a father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  I have, but what of him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc></p>

<p>Knows he of this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  He neither does nor shall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc>  Methinks a father</p>

<p>Is at the nuptial of his son a guest</p>

<p>That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,</p>

<p>Is not your father grown incapable</p>

<p>Of reasonable affairs? Is he not stupid</p>

<p>With age and alt’ring rheums? Can he speak? Hear?</p>

<p>Know man from man? Dispute his own estate?</p>

<p>Lies he not bedrid, and again does nothing</p>

<p>But what he did being childish?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  No, good sir.</p>

<p>He has his health and ampler strength indeed</p>

<p>Than most have of his age.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc>  By my white beard,</p>

<p>You offer him, if this be so, a wrong</p>

<p>Something unfilial. Reason my son</p>

<p>Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason</p>

<p>The father, all whose joy is nothing else</p>

<p>But fair posterity, should hold some counsel</p>

<p>In such a business.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  I yield all this;</p>

<p>But for some other reasons, my grave sir,</p>

<p>Which ’tis not fit you know, I not acquaint</p>

<p>My father of this business.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc>  Let him know ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc></p>

<p>He shall not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc>  Prithee let him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  No, he must not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc></p>

<p>Let him, my son. He shall not need to grieve</p>

<p>At knowing of thy choice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Come, come, he must not.</p>

<p>Mark our contract.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc> <i>[removing his disguise]</i>  Mark your divorce,</p>

<p>young sir,</p>

<p>Whom son I dare not call. Thou art too base</p>

<p>To be acknowledged. Thou a scepter’s heir</p>

<p>That thus affects a sheep-hook!–Thou, old traitor,</p>

<p>I am sorry that by hanging thee I can</p>

<p>But shorten thy life one week.–And thou, fresh</p>

<p>piece</p>

<p>Of excellent witchcraft, whom of force must know</p>

<p>The royal fool thou cop’st with–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  O, my heart!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polixenes</sc></p>

<p>I’ll have thy beauty scratched with briers and made</p>

<p>More homely than thy state.–For thee, fond boy,</p>

<p>If I may ever know thou dost but sigh</p>

<p>That thou no more shalt see this knack–as never</p>

<p>I mean thou shalt–we’ll bar thee from succession,</p>

<p>Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,</p>

<p>Far’r than Deucalion off. Mark thou my words.</p>

<p>Follow us to the court. <i>[To Shepherd.]</i> Thou, churl,</p>

<p>for this time,</p>

<p>Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee</p>

<p>From the dead blow of it.–And you, enchantment,</p>

<p>Worthy enough a herdsman–yea, him too,</p>

<p>That makes himself, but for our honor therein,</p>

<p>Unworthy thee–if ever henceforth thou</p>

<p>These rural latches to his entrance open,</p>

<p>Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,</p>

<p>I will devise a death as cruel for thee</p>

<p>As thou art tender to ’t.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  Even here undone.</p>

<p>I was not much afeard, for once or twice</p>

<p>I was about to speak and tell him plainly</p>

<p>The selfsame sun that shines upon his court</p>

<p>Hides not his visage from our cottage but</p>

<p>Looks on alike. <i>[To Florizell.]</i> Will ’t please you, sir,</p>

<p>be gone?</p>

<p>I told you what would come of this. Beseech you,</p>

<p>Of your own state take care. This dream of mine–</p>

<p>Being now awake, I’ll queen it no inch farther,</p>

<p>But milk my ewes and weep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc> <i>[to Shepherd]</i>  Why, how now, father?</p>

<p>Speak ere thou diest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  I cannot speak, nor think,</p>

<p>Nor dare to know that which I know. <i>[To Florizell.]</i></p>

<p>O sir,</p>

<p>You have undone a man of fourscore three,</p>

<p>That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,</p>

<p>To die upon the bed my father died,</p>

<p>To lie close by his honest bones; but now</p>

<p>Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me</p>

<p>Where no priest shovels in dust. <i>[To Perdita.]</i> O</p>

<p>cursed wretch,</p>

<p>That knew’st this was the Prince, and wouldst</p>

<p>adventure</p>

<p>To mingle faith with him!–Undone, undone!</p>

<p>If I might die within this hour, I have lived</p>

<p>To die when I desire.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc> <i>[to Perdita]</i>  Why look you so upon me?</p>

<p>I am but sorry, not afeard; delayed,</p>

<p>But nothing altered. What I was, I am,</p>

<p>More straining on for plucking back, not following</p>

<p>My leash unwillingly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  Gracious my lord,</p>

<p>You know your father’s temper. At this time</p>

<p>He will allow no speech, which I do guess</p>

<p>You do not purpose to him; and as hardly</p>

<p>Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear.</p>

<p>Then, till the fury of his Highness settle,</p>

<p>Come not before him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  I not purpose it.</p>

<p>I think Camillo?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc> <i>[removing his disguise]</i>  Even he, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc> <i>[to Florizell]</i></p>

<p>How often have I told you ’twould be thus?</p>

<p>How often said my dignity would last</p>

<p>But till ’twere known?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  It cannot fail but by</p>

<p>The violation of my faith; and then</p>

<p>Let nature crush the sides o’ th’ Earth together</p>

<p>And mar the seeds within. Lift up thy looks.</p>

<p>From my succession wipe me, father. I</p>

<p>Am heir to my affection.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  Be advised.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc></p>

<p>I am, and by my fancy. If my reason</p>

<p>Will thereto be obedient, I have reason.</p>

<p>If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,</p>

<p>Do bid it welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  This is desperate, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc></p>

<p>So call it; but it does fulfill my vow.</p>

<p>I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,</p>

<p>Not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may</p>

<p>Be thereat gleaned, for all the sun sees or</p>

<p>The close earth wombs or the profound seas hides</p>

<p>In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath</p>

<p>To this my fair beloved. Therefore, I pray you,</p>

<p>As you have ever been my father’s honored friend,</p>

<p>When he shall miss me, as in faith I mean not</p>

<p>To see him anymore, cast your good counsels</p>

<p>Upon his passion. Let myself and fortune</p>

<p>Tug for the time to come. This you may know</p>

<p>And so deliver: I am put to sea</p>

<p>With her who here I cannot hold on shore.</p>

<p>And most opportune to our need I have</p>

<p>A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared</p>

<p>For this design. What course I mean to hold</p>

<p>Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor</p>

<p>Concern me the reporting.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  O my lord,</p>

<p>I would your spirit were easier for advice</p>

<p>Or stronger for your need.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Hark, Perdita.–</p>

<p>I’ll hear you by and by.</p>

<p><center><i>[Florizell and Perdita walk aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  He’s irremovable,</p>

<p>Resolved for flight. Now were I happy if</p>

<p>His going I could frame to serve my turn,</p>

<p>Save him from danger, do him love and honor,</p>

<p>Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia</p>

<p>And that unhappy king, my master, whom</p>

<p>I so much thirst to see.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc> <i>[coming forward]</i>  Now, good Camillo,</p>

<p>I am so fraught with curious business that</p>

<p>I leave out ceremony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  Sir, I think</p>

<p>You have heard of my poor services i’ th’ love</p>

<p>That I have borne your father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Very nobly</p>

<p>Have you deserved. It is my father’s music</p>

<p>To speak your deeds, not little of his care</p>

<p>To have them recompensed as thought on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  Well, my</p>

<p>lord,</p>

<p>If you may please to think I love the King</p>

<p>And, through him, what’s nearest to him, which is</p>

<p>Your gracious self, embrace but my direction,</p>

<p>If your more ponderous and settled project</p>

<p>May suffer alteration. On mine honor,</p>

<p>I’ll point you where you shall have such receiving</p>

<p>As shall become your Highness, where you may</p>

<p>Enjoy your mistress–from the whom I see</p>

<p>There’s no disjunction to be made but by,</p>

<p>As heavens forfend, your ruin–marry her,</p>

<p>And with my best endeavors in your absence,</p>

<p>Your discontenting father strive to qualify</p>

<p>And bring him up to liking.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  How, Camillo,</p>

<p>May this, almost a miracle, be done,</p>

<p>That I may call thee something more than man,</p>

<p>And after that trust to thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  Have you thought on</p>

<p>A place whereto you’ll go?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Not any yet.</p>

<p>But as th’ unthought-on accident is guilty</p>

<p>To what we wildly do, so we profess</p>

<p>Ourselves to be the slaves of chance, and flies</p>

<p>Of every wind that blows.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  Then list to me.</p>

<p>This follows: if you will not change your purpose</p>

<p>But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,</p>

<p>And there present yourself and your fair princess,</p>

<p>For so I see she must be, ’fore Leontes.</p>

<p>She shall be habited as it becomes</p>

<p>The partner of your bed. Methinks I see</p>

<p>Leontes opening his free arms and weeping</p>

<p>His welcomes forth, asks thee, the son, forgiveness,</p>

<p>As ’twere i’ th’ father’s person; kisses the hands</p>

<p>Of your fresh princess; o’er and o’er divides him</p>

<p>’Twixt his unkindness and his kindness. Th’ one</p>

<p>He chides to hell and bids the other grow</p>

<p>Faster than thought or time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Worthy Camillo,</p>

<p>What color for my visitation shall I</p>

<p>Hold up before him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  Sent by the King your father</p>

<p>To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,</p>

<p>The manner of your bearing towards him, with</p>

<p>What you, as from your father, shall deliver,</p>

<p>Things known betwixt us three, I’ll write you down,</p>

<p>The which shall point you forth at every sitting</p>

<p>What you must say, that he shall not perceive</p>

<p>But that you have your father’s bosom there</p>

<p>And speak his very heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  I am bound to you.</p>

<p>There is some sap in this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  A course more promising</p>

<p>Than a wild dedication of yourselves</p>

<p>To unpathed waters, undreamed shores, most</p>

<p>certain</p>

<p>To miseries enough; no hope to help you,</p>

<p>But as you shake off one to take another;</p>

<p>Nothing so certain as your anchors, who</p>

<p>Do their best office if they can but stay you</p>

<p>Where you’ll be loath to be. Besides, you know</p>

<p>Prosperity’s the very bond of love,</p>

<p>Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together</p>

<p>Affliction alters.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  One of these is true.</p>

<p>I think affliction may subdue the cheek</p>

<p>But not take in the mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  Yea, say you so?</p>

<p>There shall not at your father’s house these seven</p>

<p>years</p>

<p>Be born another such.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  My good Camillo,</p>

<p>She’s as forward of her breeding as she is</p>

<p>I’ th’ rear our birth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  I cannot say ’tis pity</p>

<p>She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress</p>

<p>To most that teach.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  Your pardon, sir. For this</p>

<p>I’ll blush you thanks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  My prettiest Perdita.</p>

<p>But O, the thorns we stand upon!–Camillo,</p>

<p>Preserver of my father, now of me,</p>

<p>The medicine of our house, how shall we do?</p>

<p>We are not furnished like Bohemia’s son,</p>

<p>Nor shall appear in Sicilia.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  My lord,</p>

<p>Fear none of this. I think you know my fortunes</p>

<p>Do all lie there. It shall be so my care</p>

<p>To have you royally appointed as if</p>

<p>The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,</p>

<p>That you may know you shall not want, one word.</p>

<p><center><i>[They step aside and talk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Autolycus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Ha, ha, what a fool Honesty is! And Trust,</p>

<p>his sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have</p>

<p>sold all my trumpery. Not a counterfeit stone, not a</p>

<p>ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table book, ballad,</p>

<p>knife, tape, glove, shoe tie, bracelet, horn ring,</p>

<p>to keep my pack from fasting. They throng who</p>

<p>should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed</p>

<p>and brought a benediction to the buyer; by which</p>

<p>means I saw whose purse was best in picture, and</p>

<p>what I saw, to my good use I remembered. My</p>

<p>clown, who wants but something to be a reasonable</p>

<p>man, grew so in love with the wenches’ song that he</p>

<p>would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and</p>

<p>words, which so drew the rest of the herd to me that</p>

<p>all their other senses stuck in ears. You might have</p>

<p>pinched a placket, it was senseless; ’twas nothing to</p>

<p>geld a codpiece of a purse. I could have filed</p>

<p>keys off that hung in chains. No hearing, no feeling,</p>

<p>but my sir’s song and admiring the nothing of it. So</p>

<p>that in this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of</p>

<p>their festival purses. And had not the old man come</p>

<p>in with a hubbub against his daughter and the</p>

<p>King’s son, and scared my choughs from the chaff, I</p>

<p>had not left a purse alive in the whole army.</p>

<p><center><i>[Camillo, Florizell, and Perdita come forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc> <i>[to Florizell]</i></p>

<p>Though the pennyworth on his side be the worst,</p>

<p>yet hold thee, there’s some boot.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands Autolycus money.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  I am a poor fellow, sir. <i>[Aside.]</i> I know you</p>

<p>well enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  Nay, prithee, dispatch. The gentleman is half</p>

<p>flayed already.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Are you in earnest, sir? <i>[Aside.]</i> I smell the</p>

<p>trick on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Dispatch, I prithee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Indeed, I have had earnest, but I cannot</p>

<p>with conscience take it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  Unbuckle, unbuckle.</p>

<p><center><i>[Florizell and Autolycus exchange garments.]</i></center></p>

<p>Fortunate mistress–let my prophecy</p>

<p>Come home to you!–you must retire yourself</p>

<p>Into some covert. Take your sweetheart’s hat</p>

<p>And pluck it o’er your brows, muffle your face,</p>

<p>Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken</p>

<p>The truth of your own seeming, that you may–</p>

<p>For I do fear eyes over–to shipboard</p>

<p>Get undescried.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Perdita</sc>  I see the play so lies</p>

<p>That I must bear a part.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  No remedy.–</p>

<p>Have you done there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Should I now meet my father,</p>

<p>He would not call me son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  Nay, you shall have no hat.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives Florizell’s hat to Perdita.]</i></center></p>

<p>Come, lady, come.–Farewell, my friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Adieu, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc></p>

<p>O Perdita, what have we twain forgot?</p>

<p>Pray you, a word.     <i><i>[They talk aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>What I do next shall be to tell the King</p>

<p>Of this escape, and whither they are bound;</p>

<p>Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail</p>

<p>To force him after, in whose company</p>

<p>I shall re-view Sicilia, for whose sight</p>

<p>I have a woman’s longing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Florizell</sc>  Fortune speed us!–</p>

<p>Thus we set on, Camillo, to th’ seaside.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Camillo</sc>  The swifter speed the better.</p>

<p><center><i>[Camillo, Florizell, and Perdita exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  I understand the business; I hear it. To have</p>

<p>an open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand is</p>

<p>necessary for a cutpurse; a good nose is requisite</p>

<p>also, to smell out work for th’ other senses. I see this</p>

<p>is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an</p>

<p>exchange had this been without boot! What a boot</p>

<p>is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do this</p>

<p>year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore.</p>

<p>The Prince himself is about a piece of iniquity,</p>

<p>stealing away from his father with his clog at his</p>

<p>heels. If I thought it were a piece of honesty to</p>

<p>acquaint the King withal, I would not do ’t. I hold it</p>

<p>the more knavery to conceal it, and therein am I</p>

<p>constant to my profession.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Shepherd’s Son and Shepherd, carrying the</p>

<p>bundle and the box.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Aside, aside! Here is more matter for a hot brain.</p>

<p>Every lane’s end, every shop, church, session, hanging,</p>

<p>yields a careful man work.     <i><i>[He moves aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc> <i>[to Shepherd]</i>  See, see, what a man</p>

<p>you are now! There is no other way but to tell the</p>

<p>King she’s a changeling and none of your flesh and</p>

<p>blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  Nay, but hear me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  Nay, but hear me!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  Go to, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  She being none of your flesh and</p>

<p>blood, your flesh and blood has not offended the</p>

<p>King, and so your flesh and blood is not to be</p>

<p>punished by him. Show those things you found</p>

<p>about her, those secret things, all but what she has</p>

<p>with her. This being done, let the law go whistle, I</p>

<p>warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  I will tell the King all, every word, yea, and</p>

<p>his son’s pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest</p>

<p>man, neither to his father nor to me, to go about to</p>

<p>make me the King’s brother-in-law.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest</p>

<p>off you could have been to him, and then your</p>

<p>blood had been the dearer by I know how much an</p>

<p>ounce.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Very wisely, puppies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  Well, let us to the King. There is that in this</p>

<p>fardel will make him scratch his beard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  I know not what impediment this</p>

<p>complaint may be to the flight of my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  Pray heartily he be at’ palace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Though I am not naturally honest,</p>

<p>I am so sometimes by chance. Let me pocket up my</p>

<p>peddler’s excrement. <i>[(He removes his false beard.)]</i></p>

<p>How now, rustics, whither are you bound?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  To th’ palace, an it like your Worship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Your affairs there? What, with whom, the</p>

<p>condition of that fardel, the place of your dwelling,</p>

<p>your names, your ages, of what having, breeding,</p>

<p>and anything that is fitting to be known, discover!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  We are but plain fellows, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have</p>

<p>no lying. It becomes none but tradesmen, and they</p>

<p>often give us soldiers the lie, but we pay them for it</p>

<p>with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore</p>

<p>they do not give us the lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  Your Worship had like to have given</p>

<p>us one, if you had not taken yourself with the</p>

<p>manner.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  Are you a courtier, an ’t like you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier.</p>

<p>Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?</p>

<p>Hath not my gait in it the measure of the</p>

<p>court? Receives not thy nose court odor from me?</p>

<p>Reflect I not on thy baseness court contempt?</p>

<p>Think’st thou, for that I insinuate and toze from</p>

<p>thee thy business, I am therefore no courtier? I am</p>

<p>courtier cap-a-pie; and one that will either push on</p>

<p>or pluck back thy business there. Whereupon I</p>

<p>command thee to open thy affair.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  My business, sir, is to the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  What advocate hast thou to him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  I know not, an ’t like you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc> <i>[aside to Shepherd]</i>  Advocate’s the</p>

<p>court word for a pheasant. Say you have none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc> <i>[to Autolycus]</i>  None, sir. I have no pheasant,</p>

<p>cock nor hen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc></p>

<p>How blest are we that are not simple men!</p>

<p>Yet Nature might have made me as these are.</p>

<p>Therefore I will not disdain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc> <i>[to Shepherd]</i>  This cannot be but a</p>

<p>great courtier.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  His garments are rich, but he wears them</p>

<p>not handsomely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  He seems to be the more noble in</p>

<p>being fantastical. A great man, I’ll warrant. I know</p>

<p>by the picking on ’s teeth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  The fardel there. What’s i’ th’ fardel?</p>

<p>Wherefore that box?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and</p>

<p>box which none must know but the King, and</p>

<p>which he shall know within this hour if I may come</p>

<p>to th’ speech of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Age, thou hast lost thy labor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  Why, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  The King is not at the palace. He is gone</p>

<p>aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air</p>

<p>himself, for, if thou beest capable of things serious,</p>

<p>thou must know the King is full of grief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  So ’tis said, sir–about his son, that should</p>

<p>have married a shepherd’s daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  If that shepherd be not in handfast, let him</p>

<p>fly. The curses he shall have, the tortures he shall</p>

<p>feel, will break the back of man, the heart of</p>

<p>monster.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  Think you so, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Not he alone shall suffer what wit can</p>

<p>make heavy and vengeance bitter; but those that are</p>

<p>germane to him, though removed fifty times, shall</p>

<p>all come under the hangman–which, though it be</p>

<p>great pity, yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling</p>

<p>rogue, a ram tender, to offer to have his daughter</p>

<p>come into grace! Some say he shall be stoned, but</p>

<p>that death is too soft for him, say I. Draw our throne</p>

<p>into a sheepcote? All deaths are too few, the sharpest</p>

<p>too easy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  Has the old man e’er a son, sir, do you</p>

<p>hear, an ’t like you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then</p>

<p>’nointed over with honey, set on the head of a</p>

<p>wasps’-nest; then stand till he be three-quarters and</p>

<p>a dram dead, then recovered again with aqua vitae</p>

<p>or some other hot infusion; then, raw as he is, and</p>

<p>in the hottest day prognostication proclaims, shall</p>

<p>he be set against a brick wall, the sun looking with a</p>

<p>southward eye upon him, where he is to behold him</p>

<p>with flies blown to death. But what talk we of these</p>

<p>traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smiled at,</p>

<p>their offenses being so capital? Tell me–for you</p>

<p>seem to be honest plain men–what you have to the</p>

<p>King. Being something gently considered, I’ll bring</p>

<p>you where he is aboard, tender your persons to his</p>

<p>presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be</p>

<p>in man besides the King to effect your suits, here is</p>

<p>man shall do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc> <i>[to Shepherd]</i>  He seems to be of</p>

<p>great authority. Close with him, give him gold; and</p>

<p>though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft</p>

<p>led by the nose with gold. Show the inside of your</p>

<p>purse to the outside of his hand, and no more ado.</p>

<p>Remember: “stoned,” and “flayed alive.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc> <i>[to Autolycus]</i>  An ’t please you, sir, to</p>

<p>undertake the business for us, here is that gold I</p>

<p>have. I’ll make it as much more, and leave this</p>

<p>young man in pawn till I bring it you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  After I have done what I promised?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  Ay, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  Well, give me the moiety. <i>[Shepherd hands</p>

<p>him money.]</i> Are you a party in this business?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc>  In some sort, sir; but though my case</p>

<p>be a pitiful one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  O, that’s the case of the shepherd’s son!</p>

<p>Hang him, he’ll be made an example.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc> <i>[to Shepherd]</i>  Comfort, good comfort.</p>

<p>We must to the King, and show our strange</p>

<p>sights. He must know ’tis none of your daughter nor</p>

<p>my sister. We are gone else.–Sir, I will give you as</p>

<p>much as this old man does when the business is</p>

<p>performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it</p>

<p>be brought you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  I will trust you. Walk before toward the</p>

<p>seaside. Go on the right hand. I will but look upon</p>

<p>the hedge, and follow you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd’s</sc> <sc>Son</sc> <i>[to Shepherd]</i>  We are blessed in this</p>

<p>man, as I may say, even blessed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc>  Let’s before, as he bids us. He was provided</p>

<p>to do us good.     <i><i>[Shepherd and his son exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Autolycus</sc>  If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune</p>

<p>would not suffer me. She drops booties in my</p>

<p>mouth. I am courted now with a double occasion:</p>

<p>gold, and a means to do the Prince my master good;</p>

<p>which who knows how that may turn back to my</p>

<p>advancement? I will bring these two moles, these</p>

<p>blind ones, aboard him. If he think it fit to shore</p>

<p>them again and that the complaint they have to the</p>

<p>King concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue</p>

<p>for being so far officious, for I am proof against that</p>

<p>title and what shame else belongs to ’t. To him will I</p>

<p>present them. There may be matter in it.</p>
