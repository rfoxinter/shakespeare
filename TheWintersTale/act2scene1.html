<p><center><i>[Enter Hermione, Mamillius, and Ladies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermione</sc></p>

<p>Take the boy to you. He so troubles me</p>

<p>’Tis past enduring.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lady</sc>  Come, my gracious lord,</p>

<p>Shall I be your playfellow?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mamillius</sc></p>

<p>No, I’ll none of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lady</sc>  Why, my sweet lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mamillius</sc></p>

<p>You’ll kiss me hard and speak to me as if</p>

<p>I were a baby still.–I love you better.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lady</sc></p>

<p>And why so, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mamillius</sc>  Not for because</p>

<p>Your brows are blacker–yet black brows, they say,</p>

<p>Become some women best, so that there be not</p>

<p>Too much hair there, but in a semicircle,</p>

<p>Or a half-moon made with a pen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lady</sc>  Who taught this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mamillius</sc></p>

<p>I learned it out of women’s faces.–Pray now,</p>

<p>What color are your eyebrows?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lady</sc>  Blue, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mamillius</sc></p>

<p>Nay, that’s a mock. I have seen a lady’s nose</p>

<p>That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lady</sc>  Hark ye,</p>

<p>The Queen your mother rounds apace. We shall</p>

<p>Present our services to a fine new prince</p>

<p>One of these days, and then you’d wanton with us</p>

<p>If we would have you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lady</sc>  She is spread of late</p>

<p>Into a goodly bulk. Good time encounter her!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermione</sc></p>

<p>What wisdom stirs amongst you?–Come, sir, now</p>

<p>I am for you again. Pray you sit by us,</p>

<p>And tell ’s a tale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mamillius</sc>  Merry or sad shall ’t be?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermione</sc>  As merry as you will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mamillius</sc></p>

<p>A sad tale’s best for winter. I have one</p>

<p>Of sprites and goblins.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermione</sc>  Let’s have that, good sir.</p>

<p>Come on, sit down. Come on, and do your best</p>

<p>To fright me with your sprites. You’re powerful at it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mamillius</sc></p>

<p>There was a man–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermione</sc>  Nay, come sit down, then on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mamillius</sc></p>

<p>Dwelt by a churchyard. I will tell it softly,</p>

<p>Yond crickets shall not hear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermione</sc></p>

<p>Come on then, and give ’t me in mine ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[They talk privately.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Leontes, Antigonus, and Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc></p>

<p>Was he met there? His train? Camillo with him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Behind the tuft of pines I met them. Never</p>

<p>Saw I men scour so on their way. I eyed them</p>

<p>Even to their ships.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  How blest am I</p>

<p>In my just censure, in my true opinion!</p>

<p>Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accursed</p>

<p>In being so blest! There may be in the cup</p>

<p>A spider steeped, and one may drink, depart,</p>

<p>And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge</p>

<p>Is not infected; but if one present</p>

<p>Th’ abhorred ingredient to his eye, make known</p>

<p>How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,</p>

<p>With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.</p>

<p>Camillo was his help in this, his pander.</p>

<p>There is a plot against my life, my crown.</p>

<p>All’s true that is mistrusted. That false villain</p>

<p>Whom I employed was pre-employed by him.</p>

<p>He has discovered my design, and I</p>

<p>Remain a pinched thing, yea, a very trick</p>

<p>For them to play at will. How came the posterns</p>

<p>So easily open?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  By his great authority,</p>

<p>Which often hath no less prevailed than so</p>

<p>On your command.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  I know ’t too well.</p>

<p><i>[To Hermione.]</i> Give me the boy. I am glad you did</p>

<p>not nurse him.</p>

<p>Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you</p>

<p>Have too much blood in him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermione</sc>  What is this? Sport?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc> <i>[to the Ladies]</i></p>

<p>Bear the boy hence. He shall not come about her.</p>

<p>Away with him, and let her sport herself</p>

<p>With that she’s big with, <i>[(to Hermione)]</i> for ’tis</p>

<p>Polixenes</p>

<p>Has made thee swell thus.</p>

<p><center><i>[A Lady exits with Mamillius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermione</sc>  But I’d say he had not,</p>

<p>And I’ll be sworn you would believe my saying,</p>

<p>Howe’er you lean to th’ nayward.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  You, my lords,</p>

<p>Look on her, mark her well. Be but about</p>

<p>To say “She is a goodly lady,” and</p>

<p>The justice of your hearts will thereto add</p>

<p>“’Tis pity she’s not honest, honorable.”</p>

<p>Praise her but for this her without-door form,</p>

<p>Which on my faith deserves high speech, and</p>

<p>straight</p>

<p>The shrug, the “hum,” or “ha,” these petty brands</p>

<p>That calumny doth use–O, I am out,</p>

<p>That mercy does, for calumny will sear</p>

<p>Virtue itself–these shrugs, these “hum”s and “ha”s,</p>

<p>When you have said she’s goodly, come between</p>

<p>Ere you can say she’s honest. But be ’t known,</p>

<p>From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,</p>

<p>She’s an adult’ress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermione</sc>  Should a villain say so,</p>

<p>The most replenished villain in the world,</p>

<p>He were as much more villain. You, my lord,</p>

<p>Do but mistake.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  You have mistook, my lady,</p>

<p>Polixenes for Leontes. O thou thing,</p>

<p>Which I’ll not call a creature of thy place</p>

<p>Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,</p>

<p>Should a like language use to all degrees,</p>

<p>And mannerly distinguishment leave out</p>

<p>Betwixt the prince and beggar.–I have said</p>

<p>She’s an adult’ress; I have said with whom.</p>

<p>More, she’s a traitor, and Camillo is</p>

<p>A federary with her, and one that knows</p>

<p>What she should shame to know herself</p>

<p>But with her most vile principal: that she’s</p>

<p>A bed-swerver, even as bad as those</p>

<p>That vulgars give bold’st titles; ay, and privy</p>

<p>To this their late escape.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermione</sc>  No, by my life,</p>

<p>Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,</p>

<p>When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that</p>

<p>You thus have published me! Gentle my lord,</p>

<p>You scarce can right me throughly then to say</p>

<p>You did mistake.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  No. If I mistake</p>

<p>In those foundations which I build upon,</p>

<p>The center is not big enough to bear</p>

<p>A schoolboy’s top.–Away with her to prison.</p>

<p>He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty</p>

<p>But that he speaks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermione</sc>  There’s some ill planet reigns.</p>

<p>I must be patient till the heavens look</p>

<p>With an aspect more favorable. Good my lords,</p>

<p>I am not prone to weeping, as our sex</p>

<p>Commonly are, the want of which vain dew</p>

<p>Perchance shall dry your pities. But I have</p>

<p>That honorable grief lodged here which burns</p>

<p>Worse than tears drown. Beseech you all, my lords,</p>

<p>With thoughts so qualified as your charities</p>

<p>Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so</p>

<p>The King’s will be performed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Shall I be heard?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermione</sc></p>

<p>Who is ’t that goes with me? Beseech your Highness</p>

<p>My women may be with me, for you see</p>

<p>My plight requires it.–Do not weep, good fools;</p>

<p>There is no cause. When you shall know your</p>

<p>mistress</p>

<p>Has deserved prison, then abound in tears</p>

<p>As I come out. This action I now go on</p>

<p>Is for my better grace.–Adieu, my lord.</p>

<p>I never wished to see you sorry; now</p>

<p>I trust I shall.–My women, come; you have leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Go, do our bidding. Hence!</p>

<p><center><i>[Hermione exits, under guard, with her Ladies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Beseech your Highness, call the Queen again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc></p>

<p>Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice</p>

<p>Prove violence, in the which three great ones suffer:</p>

<p>Yourself, your queen, your son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  For her, my lord,</p>

<p>I dare my life lay down–and will do ’t, sir,</p>

<p>Please you t’ accept it–that the Queen is spotless</p>

<p>I’ th’ eyes of heaven, and to you–I mean</p>

<p>In this which you accuse her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc>  If it prove</p>

<p>She’s otherwise, I’ll keep my stables where</p>

<p>I lodge my wife. I’ll go in couples with her;</p>

<p>Than when I feel and see her, no farther trust her.</p>

<p>For every inch of woman in the world,</p>

<p>Ay, every dram of woman’s flesh, is false,</p>

<p>If she be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Hold your peaces.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  Good my lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc></p>

<p>It is for you we speak, not for ourselves.</p>

<p>You are abused, and by some putter-on</p>

<p>That will be damned for ’t. Would I knew the</p>

<p>villain!</p>

<p>I would land-damn him. Be she honor-flawed,</p>

<p>I have three daughters–the eldest is eleven;</p>

<p>The second and the third, nine and some five;</p>

<p>If this prove true, they’ll pay for ’t. By mine honor,</p>

<p>I’ll geld ’em all; fourteen they shall not see</p>

<p>To bring false generations. They are co-heirs,</p>

<p>And I had rather glib myself than they</p>

<p>Should not produce fair issue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Cease. No more.</p>

<p>You smell this business with a sense as cold</p>

<p>As is a dead man’s nose. But I do see ’t and feel ’t,</p>

<p>As you feel doing thus, and see withal</p>

<p>The instruments that feel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc>  If it be so,</p>

<p>We need no grave to bury honesty.</p>

<p>There’s not a grain of it the face to sweeten</p>

<p>Of the whole dungy Earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  What? Lack I credit?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,</p>

<p>Upon this ground. And more it would content me</p>

<p>To have her honor true than your suspicion,</p>

<p>Be blamed for ’t how you might.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  Why, what need we</p>

<p>Commune with you of this, but rather follow</p>

<p>Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative</p>

<p>Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness</p>

<p>Imparts this, which if you–or stupefied</p>

<p>Or seeming so in skill–cannot or will not</p>

<p>Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves</p>

<p>We need no more of your advice. The matter,</p>

<p>The loss, the gain, the ord’ring on ’t is all</p>

<p>Properly ours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc>  And I wish, my liege,</p>

<p>You had only in your silent judgment tried it,</p>

<p>Without more overture.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc>  How could that be?</p>

<p>Either thou art most ignorant by age,</p>

<p>Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight,</p>

<p>Added to their familiarity–</p>

<p>Which was as gross as ever touched conjecture,</p>

<p>That lacked sight only, naught for approbation</p>

<p>But only seeing, all other circumstances</p>

<p>Made up to th’ deed–doth push on this</p>

<p>proceeding.</p>

<p>Yet, for a greater confirmation–</p>

<p>For in an act of this importance ’twere</p>

<p>Most piteous to be wild–I have dispatched in post</p>

<p>To sacred Delphos, to Apollo’s temple,</p>

<p>Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know</p>

<p>Of stuffed sufficiency. Now from the oracle</p>

<p>They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had</p>

<p>Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lord</sc>  Well done,</p>

<p>my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leontes</sc></p>

<p>Though I am satisfied and need no more</p>

<p>Than what I know, yet shall the oracle</p>

<p>Give rest to th’ minds of others, such as he</p>

<p>Whose ignorant credulity will not</p>

<p>Come up to th’ truth. So have we thought it good</p>

<p>From our free person she should be confined,</p>

<p>Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence</p>

<p>Be left her to perform. Come, follow us.</p>

<p>We are to speak in public, for this business</p>

<p>Will raise us all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antigonus</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  To laughter, as I take it,</p>

<p>If the good truth were known.</p>
