<p><center><i>[Enter Antigonus carrying the babe, and a Mariner.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antigonus</span></p>

<p>Thou art perfect, then, our ship hath touched upon</p>

<p>The deserts of Bohemia?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mariner</span>  Ay, my lord, and fear</p>

<p>We have landed in ill time. The skies look grimly</p>

<p>And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,</p>

<p>The heavens with that we have in hand are angry</p>

<p>And frown upon ’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antigonus</span></p>

<p>Their sacred wills be done. Go, get aboard.</p>

<p>Look to thy bark. I’ll not be long before</p>

<p>I call upon thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mariner</span>  Make your best haste, and go not</p>

<p>Too far i’ th’ land. ’Tis like to be loud weather.</p>

<p>Besides, this place is famous for the creatures</p>

<p>Of prey that keep upon ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antigonus</span>  Go thou away.</p>

<p>I’ll follow instantly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mariner</span>  I am glad at heart</p>

<p>To be so rid o’ th’ business.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antigonus</span>  Come, poor babe.</p>

<p>I have heard, but not believed, the spirits o’ th’ dead</p>

<p>May walk again. If such thing be, thy mother</p>

<p>Appeared to me last night, for ne’er was dream</p>

<p>So like a waking. To me comes a creature,</p>

<p>Sometimes her head on one side, some another.</p>

<p>I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,</p>

<p>So filled and so becoming. In pure white robes,</p>

<p>Like very sanctity, she did approach</p>

<p>My cabin where I lay, thrice bowed before me,</p>

<p>And, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes</p>

<p>Became two spouts. The fury spent, anon</p>

<p>Did this break from her: “Good Antigonus,</p>

<p>Since fate, against thy better disposition,</p>

<p>Hath made thy person for the thrower-out</p>

<p>Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,</p>

<p>Places remote enough are in Bohemia.</p>

<p>There weep, and leave it crying. And, for the babe</p>

<p>Is counted lost forever, Perdita</p>

<p>I prithee call ’t. For this ungentle business</p>

<p>Put on thee by my lord, thou ne’er shalt see</p>

<p>Thy wife Paulina more.” And so, with shrieks,</p>

<p>She melted into air. Affrighted much,</p>

<p>I did in time collect myself and thought</p>

<p>This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys,</p>

<p>Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,</p>

<p>I will be squared by this. I do believe</p>

<p>Hermione hath suffered death, and that</p>

<p>Apollo would, this being indeed the issue</p>

<p>Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,</p>

<p>Either for life or death, upon the earth</p>

<p>Of its right father.–Blossom, speed thee well.</p>

<p>There lie, and there thy character; there these,</p>

<p><center><i>[He lays down the baby, a bundle, and a box.]</i></center></p>

<p>Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,</p>

<p>And still rest thine. <i>[Thunder.]</i> The storm begins.</p>

<p>Poor wretch,</p>

<p>That for thy mother’s fault art thus exposed</p>

<p>To loss and what may follow. Weep I cannot,</p>

<p>But my heart bleeds, and most accurst am I</p>

<p>To be by oath enjoined to this. Farewell.</p>

<p>The day frowns more and more. Thou ’rt like to have</p>

<p>A lullaby too rough. I never saw</p>

<p>The heavens so dim by day.</p>

<p><center><i>[Thunder, and sounds of hunting.]</i></center></p>

<p>A savage clamor!</p>

<p>Well may I get aboard! This is the chase.</p>

<p>I am gone forever!     <i><i>[He exits, pursued by a bear.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Shepherd.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  I would there were no age between ten and</p>

<p>three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the</p>

<p>rest, for there is nothing in the between but getting</p>

<p>wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing,</p>

<p>fighting–Hark you now. Would any but these</p>

<p>boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt</p>

<p>this weather? They have scared away two of my best</p>

<p>sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find than</p>

<p>the master. If anywhere I have them, ’tis by the</p>

<p>seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an ’t be thy will,</p>

<p>what have we here? Mercy on ’s, a bairn! A very</p>

<p>pretty bairn. A boy or a child, I wonder? A pretty</p>

<p>one, a very pretty one. Sure some scape. Though I</p>

<p>am not bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman</p>

<p>in the scape. This has been some stair-work,</p>

<p>some trunk-work, some behind-door work. They</p>

<p>were warmer that got this than the poor thing is</p>

<p>here. I’ll take it up for pity. Yet I’ll tarry till my son</p>

<p>come. He halloed but even now.–Whoa-ho-ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Shepherd’s Son.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Hilloa, loa!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  What, art so near? If thou ’lt see a thing to</p>

<p>talk on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither.</p>

<p>What ail’st thou, man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  I have seen two such sights, by sea</p>

<p>and by land–but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is</p>

<p>now the sky; betwixt the firmament and it, you</p>

<p>cannot thrust a bodkin’s point.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  Why, boy, how is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  I would you did but see how it chafes,</p>

<p>how it rages, how it takes up the shore. But that’s</p>

<p>not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor</p>

<p>souls! Sometimes to see ’em, and not to see ’em.</p>

<p>Now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast,</p>

<p>and anon swallowed with yeast and froth, as you’d</p>

<p>thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land</p>

<p>service, to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone,</p>

<p>how he cried to me for help, and said his</p>

<p>name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an</p>

<p>end of the ship: to see how the sea flap-dragoned it.</p>

<p>But, first, how the poor souls roared and the sea</p>

<p>mocked them, and how the poor gentleman roared</p>

<p>and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than</p>

<p>the sea or weather.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  Name of mercy, when was this, boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Now, now. I have not winked since I</p>

<p>saw these sights. The men are not yet cold under</p>

<p>water, nor the bear half dined on the gentleman.</p>

<p>He’s at it now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  Would I had been by to have helped the old</p>

<p>man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  I would you had been by the ship side,</p>

<p>to have helped her. There your charity would have</p>

<p>lacked footing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  Heavy matters, heavy matters. But look</p>

<p>thee here, boy. Now bless thyself. Thou met’st with</p>

<p>things dying, I with things newborn. Here’s a sight</p>

<p>for thee. Look thee, a bearing cloth for a squire’s</p>

<p>child. Look thee here. Take up, take up, boy. Open</p>

<p>’t. So, let’s see. It was told me I should be rich by</p>

<p>the fairies. This is some changeling. Open ’t. What’s</p>

<p>within, boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span> <i>[opening the box]</i>   <i>You’re a made old</i></p>

<p>man. If the sins of your youth are forgiven you,</p>

<p>you’re well to live. Gold, all gold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  This is fairy gold, boy, and ’twill prove so.</p>

<p>Up with ’t, keep it close. Home, home, the next way.</p>

<p>We are lucky, boy, and to be so still requires</p>

<p>nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go. Come, good</p>

<p>boy, the next way home.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Go you the next way with your</p>

<p>findings. I’ll go see if the bear be gone from the</p>

<p>gentleman and how much he hath eaten. They are</p>

<p>never curst but when they are hungry. If there be</p>

<p>any of him left, I’ll bury it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  That’s a good deed. If thou mayest discern</p>

<p>by that which is left of him what he is, fetch me to</p>

<p>th’ sight of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd’s</span> <span class='sc'>Son</span>  Marry, will I, and you shall help to</p>

<p>put him i’ th’ ground.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shepherd</span>  ’Tis a lucky day, boy, and we’ll do good</p>

<p>deeds on ’t.</p>
