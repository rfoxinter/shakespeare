<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc></p>

<p>Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,</p>

<p>Welcomed and settled to his own desire.</p>

<p>His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,</p>

<p>Unto Diana there ’s a votaress.</p>

<p>Now to Marina bend your mind,</p>

<p>Whom our fast-growing scene must find</p>

<p>At Tarsus, and by Cleon trained</p>

<p>In music, letters; who hath gained</p>

<p>Of education all the grace</p>

<p>Which makes high both the art and place</p>

<p>Of general wonder. But, alack,</p>

<p>That monster envy, oft the wrack</p>

<p>Of earned praise, Marina’s life</p>

<p>Seeks to take off by treason’s knife.</p>

<p>And in this kind our Cleon hath</p>

<p>One daughter and a full grown wench,</p>

<p>Even ripe for marriage rite. This maid</p>

<p>Hight Philoten, and it is said</p>

<p>For certain in our story she</p>

<p>Would ever with Marina be.</p>

<p>Be ’t when they weaved the sleided silk</p>

<p>With fingers long, small, white as milk;</p>

<p>Or when she would with sharp needle wound</p>

<p>The cambric, which she made more sound</p>

<p>By hurting it; or when to the lute</p>

<p>She sung, and made the night bird mute,</p>

<p>That still records with moan; or when</p>

<p>She would with rich and constant pen</p>

<p>Vail to her mistress Dian, still</p>

<p>This Philoten contends in skill</p>

<p>With absolute Marina. So</p>

<p>With the dove of Paphos might the crow</p>

<p>Vie feathers white. Marina gets</p>

<p>All praises, which are paid as debts</p>

<p>And not as given. This so darks</p>

<p>In Philoten all graceful marks</p>

<p>That Cleon’s wife, with envy rare,</p>

<p>A present murderer does prepare</p>

<p>For good Marina, that her daughter</p>

<p>Might stand peerless by this slaughter.</p>

<p>The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,</p>

<p>Lychorida, our nurse, is dead,</p>

<p>And cursed Dionyza hath</p>

<p>The pregnant instrument of wrath</p>

<p>Prest for this blow. The unborn event</p>

<p>I do commend to your content.</p>

<p>Only I carry winged Time</p>

<p>Post on the lame feet of my rhyme,</p>

<p>Which never could I so convey</p>

<p>Unless your thoughts went on my way.</p>

<p>Dionyza does appear,</p>

<p>With Leonine, a murderer.</p>
