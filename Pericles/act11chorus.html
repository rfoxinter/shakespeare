<p><center><i>[Enter Gower.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gower</sc></p>

<p>To sing a song that old was sung,</p>

<p>From ashes ancient Gower is come,</p>

<p>Assuming man’s infirmities</p>

<p>To glad your ear and please your eyes.</p>

<p>It hath been sung at festivals,</p>

<p>On ember eves and holy days,</p>

<p>And lords and ladies in their lives</p>

<p>Have read it for restoratives.</p>

<p>The purchase is to make men glorious,</p>

<p>Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.</p>

<p>If you, born in these latter times</p>

<p>When wit’s more ripe, accept my rhymes,</p>

<p>And that to hear an old man sing</p>

<p>May to your wishes pleasure bring,</p>

<p>I life would wish, and that I might</p>

<p>Waste it for you like taper light.</p>

<p>This Antioch, then: Antiochus the Great</p>

<p>Built up this city for his chiefest seat,</p>

<p>The fairest in all Syria.</p>

<p>I tell you what mine authors say.</p>

<p>This king unto him took a peer,</p>

<p>Who died and left a female heir</p>

<p>So buxom, blithe, and full of face</p>

<p>As heaven had lent her all his grace;</p>

<p>With whom the father liking took</p>

<p>And her to incest did provoke.</p>

<p>Bad child, worse father! To entice his own</p>

<p>To evil should be done by none.</p>

<p>But custom what they did begin</p>

<p>Was with long use accounted no sin.</p>

<p>The beauty of this sinful dame</p>

<p>Made many princes thither frame</p>

<p>To seek her as a bedfellow,</p>

<p>In marriage pleasures playfellow;</p>

<p>Which to prevent he made a law</p>

<p>To keep her still, and men in awe,</p>

<p>That whoso asked her for his wife,</p>

<p>His riddle told not, lost his life.</p>

<p>So for her many a wight did die,</p>

<p>As yon grim looks do testify.</p>

<p><center><i>[He indicates heads above the stage.]</i></center></p>

<p>What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye</p>

<p>I give my cause, who best can justify.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
