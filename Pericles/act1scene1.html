<p><center><i>[Enter Antiochus, Prince Pericles, and followers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antiochus</sc></p>

<p>Young Prince of Tyre, you have at large received</p>

<p>The danger of the task you undertake.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>I have, Antiochus, and with a soul</p>

<p>Emboldened with the glory of her praise</p>

<p>Think death no hazard in this enterprise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antiochus</sc></p>

<p>Music!     <i><i>[Music sounds offstage.]</i></i></p>

<p>Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride</p>

<p>For embracements even of Jove himself,</p>

<p>At whose conception, till Lucina reigned,</p>

<p>Nature this dowry gave: to glad her presence,</p>

<p>The senate house of planets all did sit</p>

<p>To knit in her their best perfections.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antiochus’ daughter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>See where she comes, appareled like the spring,</p>

<p>Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king</p>

<p>Of every virtue gives renown to men!</p>

<p>Her face the book of praises, where is read</p>

<p>Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence</p>

<p>Sorrow were ever razed, and testy wrath</p>

<p>Could never be her mild companion.</p>

<p>You gods that made me man, and sway in love,</p>

<p>That have inflamed desire in my breast</p>

<p>To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree</p>

<p>Or die in th’ adventure, be my helps,</p>

<p>As I am son and servant to your will,</p>

<p>To compass such a boundless happiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antiochus</sc></p>

<p>Prince Pericles–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>That would be son to great Antiochus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antiochus</sc></p>

<p>Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,</p>

<p>With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touched;</p>

<p>For deathlike dragons here affright thee hard.</p>

<p>Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view</p>

<p>Her countless glory, which desert must gain;</p>

<p>And which without desert, because thine eye</p>

<p>Presumes to reach, all the whole heap must die.</p>

<p><center><i>[He points to the heads.]</i></center></p>

<p>Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,</p>

<p>Drawn by report, advent’rous by desire,</p>

<p>Tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale</p>

<p>That, without covering save yon field of stars,</p>

<p>Here they stand martyrs slain in Cupid’s wars,</p>

<p>And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist</p>

<p>For going on death’s net, whom none resist.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught</p>

<p>My frail mortality to know itself,</p>

<p>And by those fearful objects to prepare</p>

<p>This body, like to them, to what I must.</p>

<p>For death remembered should be like a mirror</p>

<p>Who tells us life’s but breath, to trust it error.</p>

<p>I’ll make my will, then, and as sick men do</p>

<p>Who know the world, see heaven but, feeling woe,</p>

<p>Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;</p>

<p>So I bequeath a happy peace to you</p>

<p>And all good men, as every prince should do;</p>

<p>My riches to the earth from whence they came,</p>

<p><i>[To the Daughter.]</i> But my unspotted fire of love to</p>

<p>you.–</p>

<p>Thus ready for the way of life or death,</p>

<p>I wait the sharpest blow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antiochus</sc></p>

<p>Scorning advice, read the conclusion, then:</p>

<p>Which read and not expounded, ’tis decreed,</p>

<p>As these before thee, thou thyself shalt bleed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Daughter</sc></p>

<p>Of all ’sayed yet, mayst thou prove prosperous;</p>

<p>Of all ’sayed yet, I wish thee happiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Like a bold champion I assume the lists,</p>

<p>Nor ask advice of any other thought</p>

<p>But faithfulness and courage.</p>

<p><center><i>[He reads the Riddle:]</i></center></p>

<p>     <i>I am no viper, yet I feed</i></p>

<p>     <i>On mother’s flesh which did me breed.</i></p>

<p>     <i>I sought a husband, in which labor</i></p>

<p>     <i>I found that kindness in a father.</i></p>

<p>     <i>He’s father, son, and husband mild;</i></p>

<p>     <i>I mother, wife, and yet his child.</i></p>

<p>     <i>How they may be, and yet in two,</i></p>

<p>     <i>As you will live resolve it you.</i></p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> Sharp physic is the last! But, O you powers</p>

<p>That gives heaven countless eyes to view men’s acts,</p>

<p>Why cloud they not their sights perpetually</p>

<p>If this be true which makes me pale to read it?</p>

<p>Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still</p>

<p>Were not this glorious casket stored with ill.</p>

<p>But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt;</p>

<p>For he’s no man on whom perfections wait</p>

<p>That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.</p>

<p>You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings</p>

<p>Who, fingered to make man his lawful music,</p>

<p>Would draw heaven down and all the gods to</p>

<p>hearken;</p>

<p>But, being played upon before your time,</p>

<p>Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.</p>

<p>Good sooth, I care not for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antiochus</sc></p>

<p>Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,</p>

<p>For that’s an article within our law</p>

<p>As dangerous as the rest. Your time’s expired.</p>

<p>Either expound now or receive your sentence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc>  Great king,</p>

<p>Few love to hear the sins they love to act.</p>

<p>’Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.</p>

<p>Who has a book of all that monarchs do,</p>

<p>He’s more secure to keep it shut than shown.</p>

<p>For vice repeated is like the wand’ring wind,</p>

<p>Blows dust in others’ eyes to spread itself;</p>

<p>And yet the end of all is bought thus dear:</p>

<p>The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear</p>

<p>To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts</p>

<p>Copped hills towards heaven, to tell the Earth is</p>

<p>thronged</p>

<p>By man’s oppression, and the poor worm doth die</p>

<p>for ’t.</p>

<p>Kings are Earth’s gods; in vice their law’s their will;</p>

<p>And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?</p>

<p>It is enough you know; and it is fit,</p>

<p>What being more known grows worse, to smother it.</p>

<p>All love the womb that their first being bred;</p>

<p>Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antiochus</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Heaven, that I had thy head! He has found the</p>

<p>meaning.</p>

<p>But I will gloze with him.–Young Prince of Tyre,</p>

<p>Though by the tenor of our strict edict,</p>

<p>Your exposition misinterpreting,</p>

<p>We might proceed to cancel of your days,</p>

<p>Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree</p>

<p>As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise.</p>

<p>Forty days longer we do respite you,</p>

<p>If by which time our secret be undone,</p>

<p>This mercy shows we’ll joy in such a son.</p>

<p>And until then, your entertain shall be</p>

<p>As doth befit our honor and your worth.</p>

<p><center><i>[All except Pericles exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>How courtesy would seem to cover sin</p>

<p>When what is done is like an hypocrite,</p>

<p>The which is good in nothing but in sight.</p>

<p>If it be true that I interpret false,</p>

<p>Then were it certain you were not so bad</p>

<p>As with foul incest to abuse your soul;</p>

<p>Where now you’re both a father and a son</p>

<p>By your untimely claspings with your child,</p>

<p>Which pleasures fits a husband, not a father,</p>

<p>And she an eater of her mother’s flesh</p>

<p>By the defiling of her parents’ bed;</p>

<p>And both like serpents are, who, though they feed</p>

<p>On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.</p>

<p>Antioch, farewell, for wisdom sees those men</p>

<p>Blush not in actions blacker than the night</p>

<p>Will ’schew no course to keep them from the light.</p>

<p>One sin, I know, another doth provoke;</p>

<p>Murder’s as near to lust as flame to smoke.</p>

<p>Poison and treason are the hands of sin,</p>

<p>Ay, and the targets to put off the shame.</p>

<p>Then, lest my life be cropped to keep you clear,</p>

<p>By flight I’ll shun the danger which I fear.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antiochus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antiochus</sc>  He hath found the meaning,</p>

<p>For which we mean to have his head.</p>

<p>He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,</p>

<p>Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin</p>

<p>In such a loathed manner.</p>

<p>And therefore instantly this prince must die,</p>

<p>For by his fall my honor must keep high.–</p>

<p>Who attends us there?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Thaliard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaliard</sc>  Doth your Highness call?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antiochus</sc></p>

<p>Thaliard, you are of our chamber, Thaliard,</p>

<p>And our mind partakes her private actions</p>

<p>To your secrecy; and for your faithfulness</p>

<p>We will advance you, Thaliard. Behold,</p>

<p>Here’s poison, and here’s gold. <i>[He gives poison and</p>

<p>money.]</i> We hate the Prince</p>

<p>Of Tyre, and thou must kill him. It fits thee not</p>

<p>To ask the reason why: because we bid it.</p>

<p>Say, is it done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaliard</sc>  My lord, ’tis done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antiochus</sc>  Enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  My lord, Prince Pericles is fled.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antiochus</sc> <i>[to Thaliard]</i>  As thou wilt live, fly after,</p>

<p>and like an arrow shot from a well-experienced</p>

<p>archer hits the mark his eye doth level at, so thou</p>

<p>never return unless thou say Prince Pericles is</p>

<p>dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaliard</sc>  My lord, if I can get him within my pistol’s</p>

<p>length, I’ll make him sure enough. So, farewell to</p>

<p>your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antiochus</sc></p>

<p>Thaliard, adieu. Till Pericles be dead,</p>

<p>My heart can lend no succor to my head.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
