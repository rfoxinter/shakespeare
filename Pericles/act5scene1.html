<p><center><i>[Enter Helicanus, to him two Sailors, one from the</p>

<p>Tyrian ship and one from Mytilene.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tyrian</span> <span class='sc'>Sailor</span> <i>[to Sailor from Mytilene]</i></p>

<p>Where is Lord Helicanus? He can resolve you.</p>

<p>O, here he is.–</p>

<p>Sir, there is a barge put off from Mytilene,</p>

<p>And in it is Lysimachus, the Governor,</p>

<p>Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>That he have his.     <i><i>[Sailor from Mytilene exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Call up some gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Tyrian</span> <span class='sc'>Sailor</span>  Ho, gentlemen, my lord calls.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter two or three Gentlemen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Doth your Lordship call?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span>  Gentlemen,</p>

<p>There is some of worth would come aboard.</p>

<p>I pray, greet him fairly.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lysimachus, with Lords and Sailor from Mytilene.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sailor</span> <span class='sc'>From</span> <span class='sc'>Mytilene</span> <i>[to Lysimachus]</i>  Sir,</p>

<p>This is the man that can, in aught you would,</p>

<p>Resolve you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span> <i>[to Helicanus]</i></p>

<p>Hail, reverend sir. The gods preserve you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span>  And you, to outlive the age I am,</p>

<p>And die as I would do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  You wish me well.</p>

<p>Being on shore, honoring of Neptune’s triumphs,</p>

<p>Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,</p>

<p>I made to it to know of whence you are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span>  First, what is your place?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span></p>

<p>I am the governor of this place you lie before.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span>  Sir,</p>

<p>Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the King,</p>

<p>A man who for this three months hath not spoken</p>

<p>To anyone, nor taken sustenance</p>

<p>But to prorogue his grief.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span></p>

<p>Upon what ground is his distemperature?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span>  ’Twould be too tedious to repeat,</p>

<p>But the main grief springs from the loss</p>

<p>Of a beloved daughter and a wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  May we not see him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span>  You may,</p>

<p>But bootless is your sight. He will not speak</p>

<p>To any.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  Yet let me obtain my wish.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>Behold him. <i>[Pericles is revealed.]</i> This was a goodly</p>

<p>person,</p>

<p>Till the disaster that one mortal night</p>

<p>Drove him to this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span></p>

<p>Sir king, all hail! The gods preserve you. Hail,</p>

<p>Royal sir!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>It is in vain; he will not speak to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>Sir, we have a maid in Mytilene,</p>

<p>I durst wager would win some words of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  ’Tis well bethought.</p>

<p>She, questionless, with her sweet harmony</p>

<p>And other chosen attractions, would allure</p>

<p>And make a batt’ry through his defended ports,</p>

<p>Which now are midway stopped.</p>

<p>She is all happy as the fairest of all,</p>

<p>And, with her fellow maid, is now upon</p>

<p>The leafy shelter that abuts against</p>

<p>The island’s side.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>Sure, all effectless; yet nothing we’ll omit</p>

<p>That bears recovery’s name.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lysimachus signals to a Lord, who exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>But since your kindness</p>

<p>We have stretched thus far, let us beseech you</p>

<p>That for our gold we may provision have,</p>

<p>Wherein we are not destitute for want,</p>

<p>But weary for the staleness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  O, sir, a courtesy</p>

<p>Which, if we should deny, the most just God</p>

<p>For every graft would send a caterpillar,</p>

<p>And so inflict our province. Yet once more</p>

<p>Let me entreat to know at large the cause</p>

<p>Of your king’s sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>Sit, sir, I will recount it to you. But see,</p>

<p>I am prevented.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lord with Marina and her companion.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  O, here’s the lady that I sent for.–</p>

<p>Welcome, fair one.–Is ’t not a goodly presence?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span>  She’s a gallant lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span></p>

<p>She’s such a one that, were I well assured</p>

<p>Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,</p>

<p>I’d wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.–</p>

<p>Fair one, all goodness that consists in beauty:</p>

<p>Expect even here, where is a kingly patient,</p>

<p>If that thy prosperous and artificial feat</p>

<p>Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,</p>

<p>Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay</p>

<p>As thy desires can wish.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Sir, I will use</p>

<p>My utmost skill in his recovery, provided</p>

<p>That none but I and my companion maid</p>

<p>Be suffered to come near him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  Come, let us</p>

<p>Leave her, and the gods make her prosperous.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lysimachus, Helicanus and others move aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p><center><i>[The Song.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span> <i>[coming forward]</i></p>

<p>Marked he your music?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  No, nor looked on us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span> <i>[moving aside]</i></p>

<p>See, she will speak to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span> <i>[to Pericles]</i>  Hail, sir! My lord, lend ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Hum, ha!     <i><i>[He pushes her away.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  I am a maid, my lord,</p>

<p>That ne’er before invited eyes, but have</p>

<p>Been gazed on like a comet. She speaks,</p>

<p>My lord, that may be hath endured a grief</p>

<p>Might equal yours, if both were justly weighed.</p>

<p>Though wayward Fortune did malign my state,</p>

<p>My derivation was from ancestors</p>

<p>Who stood equivalent with mighty kings.</p>

<p>But time hath rooted out my parentage,</p>

<p>And to the world and awkward casualties</p>

<p>Bound me in servitude. <i>[Aside.]</i> I will desist,</p>

<p>But there is something glows upon my cheek,</p>

<p>And whispers in mine ear “Go not till he speak.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>My fortunes–parentage–good parentage,</p>

<p>To equal mine! Was it not thus? What say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,</p>

<p>You would not do me violence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  I do think so.</p>

<p>Pray you turn your eyes upon me.</p>

<p>You’re like something that–What</p>

<p>countrywoman?</p>

<p>Here of these shores?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  No, nor of any shores.</p>

<p>Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am</p>

<p>No other than I appear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.</p>

<p>My dearest wife was like this maid, and such</p>

<p>A one my daughter might have been: my queen’s</p>

<p>Square brows, her stature to an inch;</p>

<p>As wandlike straight, as silver-voiced; her eyes</p>

<p>As jewel-like, and cased as richly; in pace</p>

<p>Another Juno; who starves the ears she feeds</p>

<p>And makes them hungry the more she gives them</p>

<p>speech.–</p>

<p>Where do you live?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Where I am but a stranger.</p>

<p>From the deck you may discern the place.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>Where were you bred? And how achieved you these</p>

<p>Endowments which you make more rich to owe?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>If I should tell my history, it would seem</p>

<p>Like lies disdained in the reporting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Prithee, speak.</p>

<p>Falseness cannot come from thee, for thou lookest</p>

<p>Modest as Justice, and thou seemest a palace</p>

<p>For the crowned Truth to dwell in. I will believe thee</p>

<p>And make my senses credit thy relation</p>

<p>To points that seem impossible, for thou lookest</p>

<p>Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?</p>

<p>Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back–</p>

<p>Which was when I perceived thee–that thou cam’st</p>

<p>From good descending?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  So indeed I did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>Report thy parentage. I think thou said’st</p>

<p>Thou hadst been tossed from wrong to injury,</p>

<p>And that thou thought’st thy griefs might equal mine,</p>

<p>If both were opened.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Some such thing I said,</p>

<p>And said no more but what my thoughts</p>

<p>Did warrant me was likely.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Tell thy story.</p>

<p>If thine considered prove the thousand part</p>

<p>Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I</p>

<p>Have suffered like a girl. Yet thou dost look</p>

<p>Like Patience gazing on kings’ graves and smiling</p>

<p>Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?</p>

<p>How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind</p>

<p>virgin,</p>

<p>Recount, I do beseech thee. Come, sit by me.</p>

<p><center><i>[She sits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>My name is Marina.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  O, I am mocked,</p>

<p>And thou by some incensed god sent hither</p>

<p>To make the world to laugh at me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Patience, good sir,</p>

<p>Or here I’ll cease.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Nay, I’ll be patient.</p>

<p>Thou little know’st how thou dost startle me</p>

<p>To call thyself Marina.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  The name</p>

<p>Was given me by one that had some power–</p>

<p>My father, and a king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  How, a king’s daughter?</p>

<p>And called Marina?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  You said you would believe me.</p>

<p>But not to be a troubler of your peace,</p>

<p>I will end here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  But are you flesh and blood?</p>

<p>Have you a working pulse, and are no fairy</p>

<p>Motion? Well, speak on. Where were you born?</p>

<p>And wherefore called Marina?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Called Marina</p>

<p>For I was born at sea.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  At sea? What mother?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>My mother was the daughter of a king,</p>

<p>Who died the minute I was born,</p>

<p>As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft</p>

<p>Delivered weeping.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  O, stop there a little!</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> This is the rarest dream that e’er dull sleep</p>

<p>Did mock sad fools withal. This cannot be</p>

<p>My daughter, buried.–Well, where were you bred?</p>

<p>I’ll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,</p>

<p>And never interrupt you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>You scorn. Believe me, ’twere best I did give o’er.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>I will believe you by the syllable</p>

<p>Of what you shall deliver. Yet give me leave:</p>

<p>How came you in these parts? Where were you bred?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>The King my father did in Tarsus leave me,</p>

<p>Till cruel Cleon with his wicked wife</p>

<p>Did seek to murder me; and having wooed a villain</p>

<p>To attempt it, who, having drawn to do ’t,</p>

<p>A crew of pirates came and rescued me,</p>

<p>Brought me to Mytilene–But, good sir,</p>

<p>Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?</p>

<p>It may be you think me an impostor.</p>

<p>No, good faith.</p>

<p>I am the daughter to King Pericles,</p>

<p>If good King Pericles be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Ho, Helicanus!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span>  Calls my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>Thou art a grave and noble counselor,</p>

<p>Most wise in general. Tell me, if thou canst,</p>

<p>What this maid is, or what is like to be,</p>

<p>That thus hath made me weep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span>  I know not;</p>

<p>But here’s the regent, sir, of Mytilene</p>

<p>Speaks nobly of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  She never would tell</p>

<p>Her parentage. Being demanded that,</p>

<p>She would sit still and weep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>O, Helicanus! Strike me, honored sir.</p>

<p>Give me a gash, put me to present pain,</p>

<p>Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me</p>

<p>O’erbear the shores of my mortality</p>

<p>And drown me with their sweetness.–O, come hither,</p>

<p>Thou that beget’st him that did thee beget,</p>

<p>Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,</p>

<p>And found at sea again!–O, Helicanus,</p>

<p>Down on thy knees! Thank the holy gods as loud</p>

<p>As thunder threatens us. This is Marina.–</p>

<p>What was thy mother’s name? Tell me but that,</p>

<p>For truth can never be confirmed enough,</p>

<p>Though doubts did ever sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>First, sir, I pray, what is your title?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>I am Pericles of Tyre. But tell me now</p>

<p>My drowned queen’s name, as in the rest you said</p>

<p>Thou hast been godlike perfect, the heir of kingdoms,</p>

<p>And another life to Pericles thy father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>Is it no more to be your daughter than</p>

<p>To say my mother’s name was Thaisa?</p>

<p>Thaisa was my mother, who did end</p>

<p>The minute I began.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>Now, blessing on thee! Rise. Thou ’rt my child.–</p>

<p>Give me fresh garments.–Mine own Helicanus,</p>

<p>She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should</p>

<p>Have been, by savage Cleon. She shall tell thee all,</p>

<p>When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge</p>

<p>She is thy very princess. Who is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>Sir, ’tis the Governor of Mytilene,</p>

<p>Who, hearing of your melancholy state,</p>

<p>Did come to see you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span> <i>[to Lysimachus]</i>  I embrace you.–</p>

<p>Give me my robes.–I am wild in my beholding.</p>

<p><center><i>[They put fresh garments on him.]</i></center></p>

<p>O heavens bless my girl! But hark, what music?</p>

<p>Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him o’er</p>

<p>Point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,</p>

<p>How sure you are my daughter.–But what music?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span>  My lord, I hear none.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  None?</p>

<p>The music of the spheres!–List, my Marina.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span></p>

<p>It is not good to cross him. Give him way.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Rarest sounds! Do you not hear?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span></p>

<p>Music, my lord? I hear–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Most heavenly music.</p>

<p>It nips me unto list’ning, and thick slumber</p>

<p>Hangs upon mine eyes. Let me rest.     <i><i>[He sleeps.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span></p>

<p>A pillow for his head. So, leave him all.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lysimachus and others begin to exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Well, my companion friends, if this but answer</p>

<p>To my just belief, I’ll well remember you.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Pericles exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Diana descends.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diana</span></p>

<p>My temple stands in Ephesus. Hie thee thither</p>

<p>And do upon mine altar sacrifice.</p>

<p>There, when my maiden priests are met together,</p>

<p>Before the people all,</p>

<p>Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife.</p>

<p>To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter’s, call,</p>

<p>And give them repetition to the life.</p>

<p>Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;</p>

<p>Do ’t, and happy, by my silver bow.</p>

<p>Awake, and tell thy dream.     <i><i>[She ascends.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Celestial Dian,</p>

<p>Goddess argentine, I will obey thee.–</p>

<p>Helicanus!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Helicanus, Lysimachus, Marina, and</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span>  Sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike</p>

<p>The inhospitable Cleon, but I am</p>

<p>For other service first. Toward Ephesus</p>

<p>Turn our blown sails. Eftsoons I’ll tell thee why.–</p>

<p>Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,</p>

<p>And give you gold for such provision</p>

<p>As our intents will need?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  Sir,</p>

<p>With all my heart. And when you come ashore,</p>

<p>I have another suit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  You shall prevail</p>

<p>Were it to woo my daughter, for it seems</p>

<p>You have been noble towards her.</p>

<br/>
