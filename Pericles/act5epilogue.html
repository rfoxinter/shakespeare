<p><span class='sc'>Gower</span></p>

<p>In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard</p>

<p>Of monstrous lust the due and just reward.</p>

<p>In Pericles, his queen, and daughter seen,</p>

<p>Although assailed with fortune fierce and keen,</p>

<p>Virtue preserved from fell destruction’s blast,</p>

<p>Led on by heaven, and crowned with joy at last.</p>

<p>In Helicanus may you well descry</p>

<p>A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty.</p>

<p>In reverend Cerimon there well appears</p>

<p>The worth that learned charity aye wears.</p>

<p>For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame</p>

<p>Had spread his cursed deed to the honored name</p>

<p>Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,</p>

<p>That him and his they in his palace burn.</p>

<p>The gods for murder seemed so content</p>

<p>To punish, although not done, but meant.</p>

<p>So on your patience evermore attending,</p>

<p>New joy wait on you. Here our play has ending.</p>
