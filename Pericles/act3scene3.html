<p><center><i>[Enter Pericles, at Tarsus, with Cleon and Dionyza, and</p>

<p>Lychorida with the child.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>Most honored Cleon, I must needs be gone.</p>

<p>My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands</p>

<p>In a litigious peace. You and your lady</p>

<p>Take from my heart all thankfulness. The gods</p>

<p>Make up the rest upon you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span></p>

<p>Your shakes of fortune, though they haunt you</p>

<p>mortally,</p>

<p>Yet glance full wond’ringly on us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span></p>

<p>O, your sweet queen! That the strict Fates had pleased</p>

<p>You had brought her hither to have blessed mine</p>

<p>eyes with her!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>We cannot but obey the powers above us.</p>

<p>Could I rage and roar as doth the sea</p>

<p>She lies in, yet the end must be as ’tis.</p>

<p>My gentle babe Marina,</p>

<p>Whom, for she was born at sea, I have named so,</p>

<p>Here I charge your charity withal,</p>

<p>Leaving her the infant of your care,</p>

<p>Beseeching you to give her princely training,</p>

<p>That she may be mannered as she is born.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span>  Fear not, my lord, but think</p>

<p>Your Grace, that fed my country with your corn,</p>

<p>For which the people’s prayers still fall upon you,</p>

<p>Must in your child be thought on. If neglection</p>

<p>Should therein make me vile, the common body,</p>

<p>By you relieved, would force me to my duty.</p>

<p>But if to that my nature need a spur,</p>

<p>The gods revenge it upon me and mine,</p>

<p>To the end of generation!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  I believe you.</p>

<p>Your honor and your goodness teach me to ’t</p>

<p>Without your vows.–Till she be married, madam,</p>

<p>By bright Diana, whom we honor, all</p>

<p>Unscissored shall this hair of mine remain,</p>

<p>Though I show ill in ’t. So I take my leave.</p>

<p>Good madam, make me blessed in your care</p>

<p>In bringing up my child.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span>  I have one myself,</p>

<p>Who shall not be more dear to my respect</p>

<p>Than yours, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Madam, my thanks and prayers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span></p>

<p>We’ll bring your Grace e’en to the edge o’ th’ shore,</p>

<p>Then give you up to the masked Neptune</p>

<p>And the gentlest winds of heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>I will embrace your offer.–Come, dearest madam.–</p>

<p>O, no tears, Lychorida, no tears!</p>

<p>Look to your little mistress, on whose grace</p>

<p>You may depend hereafter.–Come, my lord.</p>
