<p><sc>Gower</sc></p>

<p>Marina thus the brothel ’scapes, and chances</p>

<p>   Into an honest house, our story says.</p>

<p>She sings like one immortal, and she dances</p>

<p>   As goddesslike to her admired lays.</p>

<p>Deep clerks she dumbs, and with her neele composes</p>

<p>   Nature’s own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,</p>

<p>That even her art sisters the natural roses.</p>

<p>   Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry,</p>

<p>That pupils lacks she none of noble race,</p>

<p>   Who pour their bounty on her, and her gain</p>

<p>She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place,</p>

<p>   And to her father turn our thoughts again,</p>

<p>Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost,</p>

<p>   Where, driven before the winds, he is arrived</p>

<p>Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast</p>

<p>   Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived</p>

<p>God Neptune’s annual feast to keep, from whence</p>

<p>   Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,</p>

<p>His banners sable, trimmed with rich expense,</p>

<p>   And to him in his barge with fervor hies.</p>

<p>In your supposing once more put your sight</p>

<p>   Of heavy Pericles. Think this his bark,</p>

<p>Where what is done in action–more, if might–</p>

<p>   Shall be discovered. Please you sit and hark.</p>
