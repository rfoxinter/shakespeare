<p><center><i>[Enter Cleon the Governor of Tarsus, with his wife</p>

<p>Dionyza and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span></p>

<p>My Dionyza, shall we rest us here</p>

<p>And, by relating tales of others’ griefs,</p>

<p>See if ’twill teach us to forget our own?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span></p>

<p>That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;</p>

<p>For who digs hills because they do aspire</p>

<p>Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.</p>

<p>O, my distressed lord, even such our griefs are.</p>

<p>Here they are but felt, and seen with mischief’s eyes,</p>

<p>But like to groves, being topped, they higher rise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span>  O Dionyza,</p>

<p>Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,</p>

<p>Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?</p>

<p>Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep our woes</p>

<p>Into the air, our eyes do weep till lungs</p>

<p>Fetch breath that may proclaim them louder, that</p>

<p>If heaven slumber while their creatures want,</p>

<p>They may awake their helpers to comfort them.</p>

<p>I’ll then discourse our woes, felt several years,</p>

<p>And, wanting breath to speak, help me with tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span>  I’ll do my best, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span></p>

<p>This Tarsus, o’er which I have the government,</p>

<p>A city on whom Plenty held full hand,</p>

<p>For Riches strewed herself even in her streets;</p>

<p>Whose towers bore heads so high they kissed the</p>

<p>clouds,</p>

<p>And strangers ne’er beheld but wondered at;</p>

<p>Whose men and dames so jetted and adorned,</p>

<p>Like one another’s glass to trim them by;</p>

<p>Their tables were stored full to glad the sight,</p>

<p>And not so much to feed on as delight;</p>

<p>All poverty was scorned, and pride so great,</p>

<p>The name of help grew odious to repeat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span>  O, ’tis too true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span></p>

<p>But see what heaven can do by this our change:</p>

<p>These mouths who but of late earth, sea, and air</p>

<p>Were all too little to content and please,</p>

<p>Although they gave their creatures in abundance,</p>

<p>As houses are defiled for want of use,</p>

<p>They are now starved for want of exercise.</p>

<p>Those palates who not yet two savors younger</p>

<p>Must have inventions to delight the taste,</p>

<p>Would now be glad of bread and beg for it.</p>

<p>Those mothers who, to nuzzle up their babes,</p>

<p>Thought naught too curious, are ready now</p>

<p>To eat those little darlings whom they loved.</p>

<p>So sharp are hunger’s teeth that man and wife</p>

<p>Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life.</p>

<p>Here stands a lord and there a lady weeping;</p>

<p>Here many sink, yet those which see them fall</p>

<p>Have scarce strength left to give them burial.</p>

<p>Is not this true?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span></p>

<p>Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span></p>

<p>O, let those cities that of Plenty’s cup</p>

<p>And her prosperities so largely taste,</p>

<p>With their superfluous riots, hear these tears.</p>

<p>The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Lord.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span>  Where’s the Lord Governor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span>  Here.</p>

<p>Speak out thy sorrows, which thee bring’st in haste,</p>

<p>For comfort is too far for us to expect.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>We have descried upon our neighboring shore</p>

<p>A portly sail of ships make hitherward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span>  I thought as much.</p>

<p>One sorrow never comes but brings an heir</p>

<p>That may succeed as his inheritor;</p>

<p>And so in ours. Some neighboring nation,</p>

<p>Taking advantage of our misery,</p>

<p>Hath stuffed the hollow vessels with their power</p>

<p>To beat us down, the which are down already,</p>

<p>And make a conquest of unhappy men,</p>

<p>Whereas no glory’s got to overcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>That’s the least fear, for, by the semblance</p>

<p>Of their white flags displayed, they bring us peace</p>

<p>And come to us as favorers, not as foes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span></p>

<p>Thou speak’st like him’s untutored to repeat</p>

<p>“Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.”</p>

<p>But bring they what they will and what they can,</p>

<p>What need we fear?</p>

<p>The ground’s the lowest, and we are halfway there.</p>

<p>Go tell their general we attend him here,</p>

<p>To know for what he comes and whence he comes</p>

<p>And what he craves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span>  I go, my lord.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span></p>

<p>Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;</p>

<p>If wars, we are unable to resist.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pericles with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>Lord Governor, for so we hear you are,</p>

<p>Let not our ships and number of our men</p>

<p>Be like a beacon fired t’ amaze your eyes.</p>

<p>We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre</p>

<p>And seen the desolation of your streets;</p>

<p>Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,</p>

<p>But to relieve them of their heavy load;</p>

<p>And these our ships, you happily may think</p>

<p>Are like the Trojan horse was stuffed within</p>

<p>With bloody veins expecting overthrow,</p>

<p>Are stored with corn to make your needy bread</p>

<p>And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>The gods of Greece protect you, and we’ll pray for</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Arise, I pray you, rise.</p>

<p>We do not look for reverence, but for love,</p>

<p>And harborage for ourself, our ships, and men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span> <i>[rising, with the others]</i></p>

<p>The which when any shall not gratify</p>

<p>Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,</p>

<p>Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,</p>

<p>The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!</p>

<p>Till when–the which I hope shall ne’er be seen–</p>

<p>Your Grace is welcome to our town and us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>Which welcome we’ll accept, feast here awhile,</p>

<p>Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
