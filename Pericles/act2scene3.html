<p><center><i>[Enter the King Simonides, Thaisa, Marshal, Ladies,</p>

<p>Lords, Attendants, and Knights in armor, from tilting.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc>  Knights,</p>

<p>To say you’re welcome were superfluous.</p>

<p>To place upon the volume of your deeds,</p>

<p>As in a title page, your worth in arms</p>

<p>Were more than you expect or more than ’s fit,</p>

<p>Since every worth in show commends itself.</p>

<p>Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast.</p>

<p>You are princes and my guests.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc> <i>[to Pericles]</i>  But you my knight and guest,</p>

<p>To whom this wreath of victory I give</p>

<p>And crown you king of this day’s happiness.</p>

<p><center><i>[She places a wreath on Pericles’ head.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>’Tis more by fortune, lady, than my merit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>Call it by what you will, the day is yours,</p>

<p>And here, I hope, is none that envies it.</p>

<p>In framing an artist, Art hath thus decreed,</p>

<p>To make some good but others to exceed,</p>

<p>And you are her labored scholar.–Come, queen o’</p>

<p>the feast,</p>

<p>For, daughter, so you are; here, take your place.–</p>

<p>Marshal, the rest as they deserve their grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Knights</sc></p>

<p>We are honored much by good Simonides.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>Your presence glads our days. Honor we love,</p>

<p>For who hates honor hates the gods above.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marshal</sc> <i>[to Pericles]</i>  Sir, yonder is your place.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc>  Some other is more fit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Knight</sc></p>

<p>Contend not, sir, for we are gentlemen</p>

<p>Have neither in our hearts nor outward eyes</p>

<p>Envies the great, nor shall the low despise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>You are right courteous knights.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc>  Sit, sir, sit.     <i><i>[They sit.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> By Jove I wonder, that is king of thoughts,</p>

<p>These cates resist me, he not thought upon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>By Juno, that is queen of marriage,</p>

<p>All viands that I eat do seem unsavory,</p>

<p>Wishing him my meat.–Sure, he’s a gallant</p>

<p>gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>He’s but a country gentleman;</p>

<p>Has done no more than other knights have done;</p>

<p>Has broken a staff or so. So let it pass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>To me he seems like diamond to glass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Yon king’s to me like to my father’s picture,</p>

<p>Which tells in that glory once he was–</p>

<p>Had princes sit like stars about his throne,</p>

<p>And he the sun for them to reverence.</p>

<p>None that beheld him but like lesser lights</p>

<p>Did vail their crowns to his supremacy;</p>

<p>Where now his son’s like a glowworm in the night,</p>

<p>The which hath fire in darkness, none in light;</p>

<p>Whereby I see that Time’s the king of men.</p>

<p>He’s both their parent, and he is their grave,</p>

<p>And gives them what he will, not what they crave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc>  What, are you merry, knights?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Knights</sc></p>

<p>Who can be other in this royal presence?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>Here, with a cup that’s stored unto the brim,</p>

<p>As do you love, fill to your mistress’ lips.</p>

<p>We drink this health to you.     <i><i>[He drinks.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Knights</sc>  We thank your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>Yet pause awhile. Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,</p>

<p>As if the entertainment in our court</p>

<p>Had not a show might countervail his worth.–</p>

<p>Note it not you, Thaisa?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc>  What is ’t to me, my father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>O, attend, my daughter. Princes in this</p>

<p>Should live like gods above, who freely give</p>

<p>To everyone that come to honor them.</p>

<p>And princes not doing so are like to gnats,</p>

<p>Which make a sound but, killed, are wondered at.</p>

<p>Therefore, to make his entrance more sweet,</p>

<p>Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.</p>

<p><center><i>[He drinks.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc></p>

<p>Alas, my father, it befits not me</p>

<p>Unto a stranger knight to be so bold.</p>

<p>He may my proffer take for an offense,</p>

<p>Since men take women’s gifts for impudence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc>  How?</p>

<p>Do as I bid you, or you’ll move me else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>And furthermore tell him we desire to know of him</p>

<p>Of whence he is, his name and parentage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc> <i>[going to Pericles]</i></p>

<p>The King, my father, sir, has drunk to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc>  I thank him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc></p>

<p>Wishing it so much blood unto your life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.</p>

<p><center><i>[He drinks to Simonides.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc></p>

<p>And further, he desires to know of you</p>

<p>Of whence you are, your name and parentage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>A gentleman of Tyre, my name Pericles.</p>

<p>My education been in arts and arms,</p>

<p>Who, looking for adventures in the world,</p>

<p>Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,</p>

<p>And after shipwrack driven upon this shore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc> <i>[returning to her place]</i></p>

<p>He thanks your Grace; names himself Pericles,</p>

<p>A gentleman of Tyre,</p>

<p>Who only by misfortune of the seas,</p>

<p>Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,</p>

<p>And will awake him from his melancholy.–</p>

<p>Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles</p>

<p>And waste the time which looks for other revels.</p>

<p>Even in your armors, as you are addressed,</p>

<p>Will well become a soldiers’ dance.</p>

<p>I will not have excuse with saying this:</p>

<p>“Loud music is too harsh for ladies’ heads,”</p>

<p>Since they love men in arms as well as beds.</p>

<p><center><i>[They dance.]</i></center></p>

<p>So, this was well asked, ’twas so well performed.</p>

<p>Come, sir.     <i><i>[He presents Pericles to Thaisa.]</i></i></p>

<p>Here’s a lady that wants breathing too,</p>

<p>And I have heard you knights of Tyre</p>

<p>Are excellent in making ladies trip,</p>

<p>And that their measures are as excellent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>In those that practice them they are, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>O, that’s as much as you would be denied</p>

<p>Of your fair courtesy.     <i><i>[They dance.]</i></i></p>

<p>Unclasp, unclasp!</p>

<p>Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well;</p>

<p><i>[To Pericles.]</i> But you the best.–Pages and lights, to</p>

<p>conduct</p>

<p>These knights unto their several lodgings. <i>[To</p>

<p>Pericles.]</i> Yours, sir,</p>

<p>We have given order be next our own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc>  I am at your Grace’s pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>Princes, it is too late to talk of love,</p>

<p>And that’s the mark I know you level at.</p>

<p>Therefore each one betake him to his rest,</p>

<p>Tomorrow all for speeding do their best.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
