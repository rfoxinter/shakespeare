<p><center><i>[Enter Helicanus and Escanes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>No, Escanes, know this of me:</p>

<p>Antiochus from incest lived not free,</p>

<p>For which the most high gods not minding longer</p>

<p>To withhold the vengeance that they had in store</p>

<p>Due to this heinous capital offense,</p>

<p>Even in the height and pride of all his glory,</p>

<p>When he was seated in a chariot of</p>

<p>An inestimable value, and his daughter with him,</p>

<p>A fire from heaven came and shriveled up</p>

<p>Those bodies even to loathing, for they so stunk</p>

<p>That all those eyes adored them, ere their fall,</p>

<p>Scorn now their hand should give them burial.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Escanes</span>  ’Twas very strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>And yet but justice; for though this king were great,</p>

<p>His greatness was no guard to bar heaven’s shaft,</p>

<p>But sin had his reward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Escanes</span>  ’Tis very true.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter two or three Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>See, not a man in private conference</p>

<p>Or counsel has respect with him but he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>It shall no longer grieve without reproof.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>And cursed be he that will not second it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>Follow me, then.–Lord Helicane, a word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>With me? And welcome. Happy day, my lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>Know that our griefs are risen to the top,</p>

<p>And now at length they overflow their banks.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>Your griefs? For what? Wrong not your prince you</p>

<p>love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane.</p>

<p>But if the Prince do live, let us salute him,</p>

<p>Or know what ground’s made happy by his breath.</p>

<p>If in the world he live, we’ll seek him out;</p>

<p>If in his grave he rest, we’ll find him there,</p>

<p>And be resolved he lives to govern us,</p>

<p>Or dead, give ’s cause to mourn his funeral</p>

<p>And leave us to our free election.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>Whose death’s indeed the strongest in our censure;</p>

<p>And knowing this kingdom is without a head–</p>

<p>Like goodly buildings left without a roof</p>

<p>Soon fall to ruin–your noble self,</p>

<p>That best know how to rule and how to reign,</p>

<p>We thus submit unto, our sovereign.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  Live, noble Helicane!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>Try honor’s cause; forbear your suffrages.</p>

<p>If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.</p>

<p>Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,</p>

<p>Where’s hourly trouble for a minute’s ease.</p>

<p>A twelve-month longer let me entreat you</p>

<p>To forbear the absence of your king;</p>

<p>If in which time expired, he not return,</p>

<p>I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.</p>

<p>But if I cannot win you to this love,</p>

<p>Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,</p>

<p>And in your search spend your adventurous worth,</p>

<p>Whom if you find and win unto return,</p>

<p>You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Lord</span></p>

<p>To wisdom he’s a fool that will not yield.</p>

<p>And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,</p>

<p>We with our travels will endeavor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>Then you love us, we you, and we’ll clasp hands.</p>

<p>When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.</p>
