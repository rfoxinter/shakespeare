<p><center><i>[Enter Pander, Bawd, and Bolt.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pander</span>  Bolt!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pander</span>  Search the market narrowly. Mytilene is full</p>

<p>of gallants. We lost too much money this mart by</p>

<p>being too wenchless.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  We were never so much out of creatures. We</p>

<p>have but poor three, and they can do no more than</p>

<p>they can do; and they with continual action are</p>

<p>even as good as rotten.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pander</span>  Therefore let’s have fresh ones, whate’er we</p>

<p>pay for them. If there be not a conscience to be</p>

<p>used in every trade, we shall never prosper.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Thou sayst true. ’Tis not our bringing up of poor</p>

<p>bastards–as I think I have brought up some</p>

<p>eleven–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Ay, to eleven, and brought them down again. But</p>

<p>shall I search the market?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong</p>

<p>wind will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully</p>

<p>sodden.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pander</span>  Thou sayst true. There’s two unwholesome, a’</p>

<p>conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead that</p>

<p>lay with the little baggage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Ay, she quickly pooped him. She made him</p>

<p>roast-meat for worms. But I’ll go search the</p>

<p>market.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pander</span>  Three or four thousand chequins were as</p>

<p>pretty a proportion to live quietly, and so give over.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Why to give over, I pray you? Is it a shame to get</p>

<p>when we are old?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pander</span>  O, our credit comes not in like the commodity,</p>

<p>nor the commodity wages not with the danger.</p>

<p>Therefore, if in our youths we could pick up some</p>

<p>pretty estate, ’twere not amiss to keep our door</p>

<p>hatched. Besides, the sore terms we stand upon</p>

<p>with the gods will be strong with us for giving o’er.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Come, other sorts offend as well as we.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pander</span>  As well as we? Ay, and better too; we offend</p>

<p>worse. Neither is our profession any trade; it’s no</p>

<p>calling. But here comes Bolt.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bolt with the Pirates and Marina.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Come your ways, my masters. You say she’s a</p>

<p>virgin?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pirate</span>  O, sir, we doubt it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Master, I have gone through for this piece you</p>

<p>see. If you like her, so; if not, I have lost my</p>

<p>earnest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Bolt, has she any qualities?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent</p>

<p>good clothes. There’s no farther necessity of</p>

<p>qualities can make her be refused.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  What’s her price, Bolt?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pander</span>  Well, follow me, my masters; you shall have</p>

<p>your money presently.–Wife, take her in. Instruct</p>

<p>her what she has to do, that she may not be raw in</p>

<p>her entertainment.     <i><i>[He exits with Pirates.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Bolt, take you the marks of her: the color of her</p>

<p>hair, complexion, height, her age, with warrant of</p>

<p>her virginity, and cry “He that will give most shall</p>

<p>have her first.” Such a maidenhead were no cheap</p>

<p>thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done</p>

<p>as I command you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Performance shall follow.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!</p>

<p>He should have struck, not spoke. Or that these</p>

<p>pirates,</p>

<p>Not enough barbarous, had but o’erboard thrown me</p>

<p>For to seek my mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Why lament you, pretty one?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  That I am pretty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Come, the gods have done their part in you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  I accuse them not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  You are light into my hands, where you are like</p>

<p>to live.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  The more my fault, to ’scape his hands where</p>

<p>I was to die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all</p>

<p>fashions. You shall fare well; you shall have the</p>

<p>difference of all complexions. What, do you stop</p>

<p>your ears?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Are you a woman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  What would you have me be, an I be not a</p>

<p>woman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  An honest woman, or not a woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Marry, whip the gosling! I think I shall have</p>

<p>something to do with you. Come, you’re a young</p>

<p>foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would</p>

<p>have you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  The gods defend me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  If it please the gods to defend you by men, then</p>

<p>men must comfort you, men must feed you, men</p>

<p>stir you up. Bolt’s returned.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bolt.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  I have cried her almost to the number of her</p>

<p>hairs. I have drawn her picture with my voice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the inclination</p>

<p>of the people, especially of the younger</p>

<p>sort?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Faith, they listened to me as they would have</p>

<p>hearkened to their father’s testament. There was a</p>

<p>Spaniard’s mouth watered an he went to bed to her</p>

<p>very description.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  We shall have him here tomorrow with his best</p>

<p>ruff on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Tonight, tonight! But, mistress, do you know the</p>

<p>French knight that cowers i’ the hams?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Who? Monsieur Verolles?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Ay, he. He offered to cut a caper at the proclamation,</p>

<p>but he made a groan at it and swore he would</p>

<p>see her tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Well, well, as for him, he brought his disease</p>

<p>hither; here he does but repair it. I know he will</p>

<p>come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the</p>

<p>sun.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Well, if we had of every nation a traveler, we</p>

<p>should lodge them with this sign.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span> <i>[to Marina]</i>  Pray you, come hither awhile. You</p>

<p>have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you</p>

<p>must seem to do that fearfully which you commit</p>

<p>willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.</p>

<p>To weep that you live as you do makes pity in your</p>

<p>lovers. Seldom but that pity begets you a good</p>

<p>opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  I understand you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  O, take her home, mistress, take her home!</p>

<p>These blushes of hers must be quenched with</p>

<p>some present practice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Thou sayst true, i’ faith, so they must, for your</p>

<p>bride goes to that with shame which is her way to</p>

<p>go with warrant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Faith, some do and some do not. But, mistress,</p>

<p>if I have bargained for the joint–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  I may so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like</p>

<p>the manner of your garments well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Bolt, spend thou that in the town. <i>[(She gives him</p>

<p>money.)]</i> Report what a sojourner we have. You’ll</p>

<p>lose nothing by custom. When Nature framed this</p>

<p>piece, she meant thee a good turn. Therefore say</p>

<p>what a paragon she is, and thou hast the harvest</p>

<p>out of thine own report.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so</p>

<p>awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty</p>

<p>stirs up the lewdly inclined. I’ll bring home some</p>

<p>tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span> <i>[to Marina]</i>  Come your ways. Follow me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,</p>

<p>Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.</p>

<p>Diana aid my purpose!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  What have we to do with Diana, pray you? Will</p>

<p>you go with us?</p>
