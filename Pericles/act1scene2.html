<p><center><i>[Enter Pericles with an Attendant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Let none disturb us. <i>[(Attendant exits.)]</i> Why should</p>

<p>this change of thoughts,</p>

<p>The sad companion dull-eyed Melancholy,</p>

<p>Be my so used a guest as not an hour</p>

<p>In the day’s glorious walk or peaceful night,</p>

<p>The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me</p>

<p>quiet?</p>

<p>Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun</p>

<p>them;</p>

<p>And danger, which I feared, is at Antioch,</p>

<p>Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here.</p>

<p>Yet neither pleasure’s art can joy my spirits,</p>

<p>Nor yet the other’s distance comfort me.</p>

<p>Then it is thus: the passions of the mind</p>

<p>That have their first conception by misdread</p>

<p>Have after-nourishment and life by care;</p>

<p>And what was first but fear what might be done</p>

<p>Grows elder now, and cares it be not done.</p>

<p>And so with me. The great Antiochus,</p>

<p>’Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</p>

<p>Since he’s so great can make his will his act,</p>

<p>Will think me speaking though I swear to silence;</p>

<p>Nor boots it me to say I honor him</p>

<p>If he suspect I may dishonor him.</p>

<p>And what may make him blush in being known,</p>

<p>He’ll stop the course by which it might be known.</p>

<p>With hostile forces he’ll o’er-spread the land,</p>

<p>And with th’ ostent of war will look so huge</p>

<p>Amazement shall drive courage from the state,</p>

<p>Our men be vanquished ere they do resist,</p>

<p>And subjects punished that ne’er thought offense;</p>

<p>Which care of them, not pity of myself,</p>

<p>Who am no more but as the tops of trees</p>

<p>Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,</p>

<p>Makes both my body pine and soul to languish</p>

<p>And punish that before that he would punish.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Helicanus and all the Lords to Pericles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>And keep your mind till you return to us</p>

<p>Peaceful and comfortable.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helicanus</sc></p>

<p>Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.</p>

<p>They do abuse the King that flatter him,</p>

<p>For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;</p>

<p>The thing the which is flattered, but a spark</p>

<p>To which that wind gives heat and stronger glowing;</p>

<p>Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,</p>

<p>Fits kings as they are men, for they may err.</p>

<p>When Signior Sooth here does proclaim peace,</p>

<p>He flatters you, makes war upon your life.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please.</p>

<p>I cannot be much lower than my knees.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>All leave us else; but let your cares o’erlook</p>

<p>What shipping and what lading’s in our haven,</p>

<p>And then return to us.     <i><i>[The Lords exit.]</i></i></p>

<p>Helicanus,</p>

<p>Thou hast moved us. What seest thou in our looks?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helicanus</sc>  An angry brow, dread lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>If there be such a dart in princes’ frowns,</p>

<p>How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helicanus</sc></p>

<p>How dares the plants look up to heaven,</p>

<p>From whence they have their nourishment?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Thou knowest I have power to take thy life from thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helicanus</sc>  I have ground the ax myself;</p>

<p>Do but you strike the blow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Rise, prithee rise.     <i><i>[Helicanus rises.]</i></i></p>

<p>Sit down. Thou art no flatterer.</p>

<p>I thank thee for ’t; and heaven forbid</p>

<p>That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid.</p>

<p>Fit counselor and servant for a prince,</p>

<p>Who by thy wisdom makes a prince thy servant,</p>

<p>What wouldst thou have me do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helicanus</sc>  To bear with patience such griefs</p>

<p>As you yourself do lay upon yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Thou speak’st like a physician, Helicanus,</p>

<p>That ministers a potion unto me</p>

<p>That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.</p>

<p>Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,</p>

<p>Where, as thou know’st, against the face of death</p>

<p>I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty</p>

<p>From whence an issue I might propagate,</p>

<p>Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects.</p>

<p>Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder,</p>

<p>The rest–hark in thine ear–as black as incest,</p>

<p>Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father</p>

<p>Seemed not to strike, but smooth. But thou know’st</p>

<p>this:</p>

<p>’Tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss;</p>

<p>Which fear so grew in me I hither fled</p>

<p>Under the covering of a careful night,</p>

<p>Who seemed my good protector; and, being here,</p>

<p>Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.</p>

<p>I knew him tyrannous, and tyrants’ fears</p>

<p>Decrease not but grow faster than the years;</p>

<p>And should he doubt, as no doubt he doth,</p>

<p>That I should open to the list’ning air</p>

<p>How many worthy princes’ bloods were shed</p>

<p>To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,</p>

<p>To lop that doubt he’ll fill this land with arms,</p>

<p>And make pretense of wrong that I have done him;</p>

<p>When all, for mine–if I may call ’t–offense,</p>

<p>Must feel war’s blow, who spares not innocence;</p>

<p>Which love to all–of which thyself art one,</p>

<p>Who now reproved’st me for ’t–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helicanus</sc>  Alas, sir!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,</p>

<p>Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts</p>

<p>How I might stop this tempest ere it came;</p>

<p>And finding little comfort to relieve them,</p>

<p>I thought it princely charity to grieve for them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helicanus</sc></p>

<p>Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,</p>

<p>Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,</p>

<p>And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,</p>

<p>Who either by public war or private treason</p>

<p>Will take away your life.</p>

<p>Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,</p>

<p>Till that his rage and anger be forgot,</p>

<p>Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.</p>

<p>Your rule direct to any. If to me,</p>

<p>Day serves not light more faithful than I’ll be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc>  I do not doubt thy faith.</p>

<p>But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helicanus</sc></p>

<p>We’ll mingle our bloods together in the earth,</p>

<p>From whence we had our being and our birth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Tyre, I now look from thee, then, and to Tarsus</p>

<p>Intend my travel, where I’ll hear from thee,</p>

<p>And by whose letters I’ll dispose myself.</p>

<p>The care I had and have of subjects’ good</p>

<p>On thee I lay, whose wisdom’s strength can bear it.</p>

<p>I’ll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath.</p>

<p>Who shuns not to break one will crack both.</p>

<p>But in our orbs we’ll live so round and safe</p>

<p>That time of both this truth shall ne’er convince.</p>

<p>Thou showed’st a subject’s shine, I a true prince.</p>
