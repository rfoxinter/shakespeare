<p><center><i>[Enter King Simonides, with Lords, Attendants,</p>

<p>and Thaisa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc>  They are, my liege,</p>

<p>And stay your coming to present themselves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>Return them we are ready, and our daughter here,</p>

<p>In honor of whose birth these triumphs are,</p>

<p>Sits here like Beauty’s child, whom Nature gat</p>

<p>For men to see and, seeing, wonder at.</p>

<p><center><i>[An Attendant exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc></p>

<p>It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express</p>

<p>My commendations great, whose merit’s less.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>It’s fit it should be so, for princes are</p>

<p>A model which heaven makes like to itself.</p>

<p>As jewels lose their glory if neglected,</p>

<p>So princes their renowns if not respected.</p>

<p>’Tis now your honor, daughter, to entertain</p>

<p>The labor of each knight in his device.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc></p>

<p>Which to preserve mine honor, I’ll perform.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The first Knight passes by. His Squire presents a shield</p>

<p>to Thaisa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>Who is the first that doth prefer himself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc></p>

<p>A knight of Sparta, my renowned father,</p>

<p>And the device he bears upon his shield</p>

<p>Is a black Ethiop reaching at the sun;</p>

<p>The word: Lux tua vita mihi.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>He loves you well that holds his life of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The second Knight passes by. His Squire presents a</p>

<p>shield to Thaisa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>Who is the second that presents himself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc></p>

<p>A prince of Macedon, my royal father,</p>

<p>And the device he bears upon his shield</p>

<p>Is an armed knight that’s conquered by a lady.</p>

<p>The motto thus, in Spanish: Pue per doleera kee per</p>

<p>forsa.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The third Knight passes by. His Squire presents a shield</p>

<p>to Thaisa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>And what’s the third?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc>  The third, of Antioch;</p>

<p>And his device a wreath of chivalry;</p>

<p>The word: Me pompae provexit apex.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The fourth Knight passes by. His Squire presents a</p>

<p>shield to Thaisa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc>  What is the fourth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc></p>

<p>A burning torch that’s turned upside down;</p>

<p>The word: Qui me alit me extinguit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,</p>

<p>Which can as well inflame as it can kill.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The fifth Knight passes by. His Squire presents a shield</p>

<p>to Thaisa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc></p>

<p>The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,</p>

<p>Holding out gold that’s by the touchstone tried;</p>

<p>The motto thus: Sic spectanda fides.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The sixth Knight, Pericles, passes by. He presents a</p>

<p>shield to Thaisa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>And what’s the sixth and last, the which the knight</p>

<p>himself</p>

<p>With such a graceful courtesy delivered?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc></p>

<p>He seems to be a stranger; but his present is</p>

<p>A withered branch that’s only green at top,</p>

<p>The motto: In hac spe vivo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc>  A pretty moral.</p>

<p>From the dejected state wherein he is,</p>

<p>He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>He had need mean better than his outward show</p>

<p>Can any way speak in his just commend,</p>

<p>For by his rusty outside he appears</p>

<p>To have practiced more the whipstock than the lance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>He well may be a stranger, for he comes</p>

<p>To an honored triumph strangely furnished.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>And on set purpose let his armor rust</p>

<p>Until this day, to scour it in the dust.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simonides</sc></p>

<p>Opinion’s but a fool that makes us scan</p>

<p>The outward habit by the inward man.</p>

<p>But stay, the knights are coming.</p>

<p>We will withdraw into the gallery.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Great shouts offstage, and all cry, “The mean knight.”]</i></center></p>
