<p>Here have you seen a mighty king</p>

<p>His child, iwis, to incest bring;</p>

<p>A better prince and benign lord</p>

<p>That will prove awful both in deed and word.</p>

<p>Be quiet, then, as men should be,</p>

<p>Till he hath passed necessity.</p>

<p>I’ll show you those in troubles reign,</p>

<p>Losing a mite, a mountain gain.</p>

<p>The good in conversation,</p>

<p>To whom I give my benison,</p>

<p>Is still at Tarsus, where each man</p>

<p>Thinks all is Writ he speken can,</p>

<p>And, to remember what he does,</p>

<p>Build his statue to make him glorious.</p>

<p>But tidings to the contrary</p>

<p>Are brought your eyes. What need speak I?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Dumb Show.</p>

<br/>

<p>Enter at one door Pericles talking with Cleon, all the</p>

<p>train with them. Enter at another door a Gentleman,</p>

<p>with a letter to Pericles. Pericles shows the letter to</p>

<p>Cleon. Pericles gives the Messenger a reward and knights</p>

<p>him. Pericles exits at one door, and Cleon at another.]</i></center></p>

<p>Good Helicane, that stayed at home–</p>

<p>Not to eat honey like a drone</p>

<p>From others’ labors, for though he strive</p>

<p>To killen bad, keep good alive,</p>

<p>And to fulfill his prince’ desire–</p>

<p>Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:</p>

<p>How Thaliard came full bent with sin,</p>

<p>And had intent to murder him;</p>

<p>And that in Tarsus was not best</p>

<p>Longer for him to make his rest.</p>

<p>He, doing so, put forth to seas,</p>

<p>Where when men been there’s seldom ease;</p>

<p>For now the wind begins to blow;</p>

<p>Thunder above and deeps below</p>

<p>Makes such unquiet that the ship</p>

<p>Should house him safe is wracked and split,</p>

<p>And he, good prince, having all lost,</p>

<p>By waves from coast to coast is tossed.</p>

<p>All perishen of man, of pelf,</p>

<p>Ne aught escapend but himself;</p>

<p>Till Fortune, tired with doing bad,</p>

<p>Threw him ashore to give him glad.</p>

<p>And here he comes. What shall be next,</p>

<p>Pardon old Gower–this ’longs the text.</p>
