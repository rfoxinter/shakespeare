<p><center><i>[Enter Bawd, Pander, and Bolt.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pander</span>  Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her</p>

<p>she had ne’er come here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Fie, fie upon her! She’s able to freeze the god</p>

<p>Priapus and undo a whole generation. We must</p>

<p>either get her ravished or be rid of her. When she</p>

<p>should do for clients her fitment and do me the</p>

<p>kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,</p>

<p>her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her</p>

<p>knees, that she would make a puritan of the devil if</p>

<p>he should cheapen a kiss of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Faith, I must ravish her, or she’ll disfurnish us of</p>

<p>all our cavalleria, and make our swearers priests.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pander</span>  Now the pox upon her greensickness for me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Faith, there’s no way to be rid on ’t but by the</p>

<p>way to the pox.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lysimachus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish</p>

<p>baggage would but give way to customers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span> <i>[removing his disguise]</i>  How now! How a</p>

<p>dozen of virginities?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Now the gods to-bless your Honor!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  I am glad to see your Honor in good health.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  You may so. ’Tis the better for you that</p>

<p>your resorters stand upon sound legs. How now?</p>

<p>Wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal</p>

<p>withal and defy the surgeon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  We have here one, sir, if she would–but there</p>

<p>never came her like in Mytilene.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  If she’d do the deeds of darkness, thou</p>

<p>wouldst say?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Your Honor knows what ’tis to say, well enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  Well, call forth, call forth.     <i><i>[Pander exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall</p>

<p>see a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had</p>

<p>but–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  What, prithee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  O, sir, I can be modest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  That dignifies the renown of a bawd no</p>

<p>less than it gives a good report to a number to be</p>

<p>chaste.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pander with Marina.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Here comes that which grows to the stalk, never</p>

<p>plucked yet, I can assure you. Is she not a fair</p>

<p>creature?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  Faith, she would serve after a long voyage</p>

<p>at sea. Well, there’s for you.     <i><i>[He gives money.]</i></i></p>

<p>Leave us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  I beseech your Honor, give me leave a word, and</p>

<p>I’ll have done presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  I beseech you, do.     <i><i>[He moves aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span> <i>[to Marina]</i>  First, I would have you note this is</p>

<p>an honorable man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  I desire to find him so, that I may worthily</p>

<p>note him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Next, he’s the governor of this country and a</p>

<p>man whom I am bound to.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  If he govern the country, you are bound to him</p>

<p>indeed, but how honorable he is in that I know</p>

<p>not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Pray you, without any more virginal fencing,</p>

<p>will you use him kindly? He will line your apron</p>

<p>with gold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  What he will do graciously, I will thankfully</p>

<p>receive.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span> <i>[coming forward]</i>  Ha’ you done?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  My lord, she’s not paced yet. You must take some</p>

<p>pains to work her to your manage.–Come, we will</p>

<p>leave his Honor and her together. Go thy ways.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bawd, Pander, and Bolt exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  Now, pretty one, how long have you been</p>

<p>at this trade?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  What trade, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  Why, I cannot name ’t but I shall offend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  I cannot be offended with my trade. Please</p>

<p>you to name it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  How long have you been of this profession?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  E’er since I can remember.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  Did you go to ’t so young? Were you a</p>

<p>gamester at five or at seven?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  Why, the house you dwell in proclaims</p>

<p>you to be a creature of sale.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Do you know this house to be a place of such</p>

<p>resort, and will come into ’t? I hear say you’re of</p>

<p>honorable parts and are the governor of this place.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  Why, hath your principal made known</p>

<p>unto you who I am?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Who is my principal?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  Why, your herbwoman, she that sets</p>

<p>seeds and roots of shame and iniquity. O, you have</p>

<p>heard something of my power, and so stand aloof</p>

<p>for more serious wooing. But I protest to thee,</p>

<p>pretty one, my authority shall not see thee, or else</p>

<p>look friendly upon thee. Come, bring me to some</p>

<p>private place. Come, come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>If you were born to honor, show it now;</p>

<p>If put upon you, make the judgment good</p>

<p>That thought you worthy of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span></p>

<p>How’s this? How’s this? Some more. Be sage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  For me</p>

<p>That am a maid, though most ungentle Fortune</p>

<p>Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,</p>

<p>Diseases have been sold dearer than physic–</p>

<p>That the gods</p>

<p>Would set me free from this unhallowed place,</p>

<p>Though they did change me to the meanest bird</p>

<p>That flies i’ the purer air!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  I did not think</p>

<p>Thou couldst have spoke so well, ne’er dreamt thou</p>

<p>couldst.</p>

<p>Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,</p>

<p>Thy speech had altered it. Hold, here’s gold for thee.</p>

<p>Persevere in that clear way thou goest</p>

<p>And the gods strengthen thee!     <i><i>[He gives her money.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  The good gods preserve you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  For me, be you thoughten</p>

<p>That I came with no ill intent, for to me</p>

<p>The very doors and windows savor vilely.</p>

<p>Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue,</p>

<p>And I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.</p>

<p>Hold, here’s more gold for thee.     <i><i>[He gives her money.]</i></i></p>

<p>A curse upon him, die he like a thief,</p>

<p>That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost</p>

<p>Hear from me, it shall be for thy good.</p>

<p><center><i>[He begins to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span> <i>[at the door]</i>  I beseech your Honor, one piece</p>

<p>for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysimachus</span>  Avaunt, thou damned doorkeeper!</p>

<p>Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,</p>

<p>Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  How’s this? We must take another course with</p>

<p>you! If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a</p>

<p>breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,</p>

<p>shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded</p>

<p>like a spaniel. Come your ways.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Whither would you have me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the</p>

<p>common hangman shall execute it. Come your</p>

<p>way. We’ll have no more gentlemen driven away.</p>

<p>Come your ways, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bawd and Pander.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  How now, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Worse and worse, mistress. She has here spoken</p>

<p>holy words to the Lord Lysimachus!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  O, abominable!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  He makes our profession as it were to stink afore</p>

<p>the face of the gods.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Marry, hang her up forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  The nobleman would have dealt with her like a</p>

<p>nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a</p>

<p>snowball, saying his prayers too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Bolt, take her away, use her at thy pleasure,</p>

<p>crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest</p>

<p>malleable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  An if she were a thornier piece of ground than</p>

<p>she is, she shall be plowed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Hark, hark, you gods!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  She conjures. Away with her! Would she had</p>

<p>never come within my doors.–Marry, hang you!–</p>

<p>She’s born to undo us.–Will you not go the way of</p>

<p>womenkind? Marry come up, my dish of chastity</p>

<p>with rosemary and bays!     <i><i>[Bawd and Pander exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Come, mistress, come your way with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Whither wilt thou have me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Prithee, tell me one thing first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Come, now, your one thing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Why, I could wish him to be my master, or</p>

<p>rather, my mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>Neither of these are so bad as thou art,</p>

<p>Since they do better thee in their command.</p>

<p>Thou hold’st a place for which the pained’st fiend</p>

<p>Of hell would not in reputation change.</p>

<p>Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every</p>

<p>Coistrel that comes enquiring for his Tib.</p>

<p>To the choleric fisting of every rogue</p>

<p>Thy ear is liable. Thy food is such</p>

<p>As hath been belched on by infected lungs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  What would you have me do? Go to the wars,</p>

<p>would you, where a man may serve seven years for</p>

<p>the loss of a leg, and have not money enough in the</p>

<p>end to buy him a wooden one?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>Do anything but this thou dost. Empty</p>

<p>Old receptacles, or common shores, of filth;</p>

<p>Serve by indenture to the common hangman.</p>

<p>Any of these ways are yet better than this.</p>

<p>For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,</p>

<p>Would own a name too dear. That the gods</p>

<p>Would safely deliver me from this place!</p>

<p>Here, here’s gold for thee.     <i><i>[She gives him money.]</i></i></p>

<p>If that thy master would gain by me,</p>

<p>Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,</p>

<p>With other virtues which I’ll keep from boast,</p>

<p>And will undertake all these to teach.</p>

<p>I doubt not but this populous city</p>

<p>Will yield many scholars.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  But can you teach all this you speak of?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>Prove that I cannot, take me home again</p>

<p>And prostitute me to the basest groom</p>

<p>That doth frequent your house.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Well, I will see what I can do for thee. If I can</p>

<p>place thee, I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  But amongst honest women.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolt</span>  Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.</p>

<p>But since my master and mistress hath bought</p>

<p>you, there’s no going but by their consent. Therefore</p>

<p>I will make them acquainted with your</p>

<p>purpose, and I doubt not but I shall find them</p>

<p>tractable enough. Come, I’ll do for thee what I can.</p>

<p>Come your ways.</p>
