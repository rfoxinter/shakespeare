<p><center><i>[Enter Pericles, wet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!</p>

<p>Wind, rain, and thunder, remember earthly man</p>

<p>Is but a substance that must yield to you,</p>

<p>And I, as fits my nature, do obey you.</p>

<p>Alas, the seas hath cast me on the rocks,</p>

<p>Washed me from shore to shore, and left my breath</p>

<p>Nothing to think on but ensuing death.</p>

<p>Let it suffice the greatness of your powers</p>

<p>To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;</p>

<p>And, having thrown him from your wat’ry grave,</p>

<p>Here to have death in peace is all he’ll crave.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter three Fishermen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  What ho, Pilch!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Ha, come and bring away the nets!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  What, Patchbreech, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  What say you, master?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Look how thou stirr’st now! Come</p>

<p>away, or I’ll fetch thee with a wanion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Faith, master, I am thinking of the</p>

<p>poor men that were cast away before us even now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart</p>

<p>to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help</p>

<p>them, when, welladay, we could scarce help</p>

<p>ourselves!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Nay, master, said not I as much</p>

<p>when I saw the porpoise how he bounced and tumbled?</p>

<p>They say they’re half fish, half flesh. A plague</p>

<p>on them! They ne’er come but I look to be washed.</p>

<p>Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Why, as men do a-land: the great</p>

<p>ones eat up the little ones. I can compare our rich</p>

<p>misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale: he plays</p>

<p>and tumbles, driving the poor fry before him and</p>

<p>at last devours them all at a mouthful. Such</p>

<p>whales have I heard on a’ the land, who never leave</p>

<p>gaping till they swallowed the whole parish–</p>

<p>church, steeple, bells and all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span> <i>[aside]</i>  A pretty moral.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  But, master, if I had been the sexton,</p>

<p>I would have been that day in the belfry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Why, man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Because he should have swallowed</p>

<p>me too. And when I had been in his belly, I would</p>

<p>have kept such a jangling of the bells that he should</p>

<p>never have left till he cast bells, steeple, church, and</p>

<p>parish up again. But if the good King Simonides</p>

<p>were of my mind–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Simonides?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  We would purge the land of these</p>

<p>drones that rob the bee of her honey.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>How from the finny subject of the sea</p>

<p>These fishers tell the infirmities of men,</p>

<p>And from their wat’ry empire recollect</p>

<p>All that may men approve or men detect!–</p>

<p>Peace be at your labor, honest fishermen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Honest good fellow, what’s that? If</p>

<p>it be a day fits you, search out of the calendar, and</p>

<p>nobody look after it!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>May see the sea hath cast upon your coast–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  What a drunken knave was the sea</p>

<p>to cast thee in our way!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>A man whom both the waters and the wind</p>

<p>In that vast tennis court hath made the ball</p>

<p>For them to play upon entreats you pity him.</p>

<p>He asks of you that never used to beg.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  No, friend, cannot you beg? Here’s</p>

<p>them in our country of Greece gets more with begging</p>

<p>than we can do with working.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span> <i>[to Pericles]</i>  Canst thou catch any</p>

<p>fishes, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  I never practiced it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Nay, then, thou wilt starve sure,</p>

<p>for here’s nothing to be got nowadays unless thou</p>

<p>canst fish for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>What I have been I have forgot to know,</p>

<p>But what I am want teaches me to think on:</p>

<p>A man thronged up with cold. My veins are chill</p>

<p>And have no more of life than may suffice</p>

<p>To give my tongue that heat to ask your help–</p>

<p>Which, if you shall refuse, when I am dead,</p>

<p>For that I am a man, pray you see me buried.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Die, quotha? Now gods forbid ’t, an I</p>

<p>have a gown. Here, come, put it on; keep thee</p>

<p>warm. <i>[Pericles puts on the garment.]</i> Now, afore</p>

<p>me, a handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home,</p>

<p>and we’ll have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting</p>

<p>days, and, moreo’er, puddings and flapjacks, and</p>

<p>thou shalt be welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  I thank you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Hark you, my friend. You said you</p>

<p>could not beg?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  I did but crave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  But crave? Then I’ll turn craver</p>

<p>too, and so I shall ’scape whipping.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Why, are your beggars whipped, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  O, not all, my friend, not all; for if</p>

<p>all your beggars were whipped, I would wish no</p>

<p>better office than to be beadle.–But, master, I’ll go</p>

<p>draw up the net.     <i><i>[He exits with Third Fisherman.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>How well this honest mirth becomes their labor!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Hark you, sir, do you know where</p>

<p>you are?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Not well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Why, I’ll tell you. This is called Pentapolis,</p>

<p>and our king the good Simonides.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  “The good Simonides” do you call him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Ay, sir, and he deserves so to be called</p>

<p>for his peaceable reign and good government.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  He is a happy king, since he gains from his</p>

<p>subjects the name of “good” by his government.</p>

<p>How far is his court distant from this shore?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Marry, sir, half a day’s journey. And</p>

<p>I’ll tell you, he hath a fair daughter, and tomorrow</p>

<p>is her birthday; and there are princes and knights</p>

<p>come from all parts of the world to joust and tourney</p>

<p>for her love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I</p>

<p>could wish to make one there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  O, sir, things must be as they may;</p>

<p>and what a man cannot get he may lawfully deal</p>

<p>for his wife’s soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the two other Fishermen, drawing up a net.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Help, master, help! Here’s a fish</p>

<p>hangs in the net like a poor man’s right in the law:</p>

<p>’twill hardly come out. Ha! Bots on ’t, ’tis come at</p>

<p>last, and ’tis turned to a rusty armor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>An armor, friends? I pray you let me see it.</p>

<p><center><i>[They pull out the armor.]</i></center></p>

<p>Thanks, Fortune, yet, that after all thy crosses</p>

<p>Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;</p>

<p>And though it was mine own, part of my heritage</p>

<p>Which my dead father did bequeath to me</p>

<p>With this strict charge even as he left his life,</p>

<p>“Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield</p>

<p>’Twixt me and death,” and pointed to this brace,</p>

<p>“For that it saved me, keep it. In like necessity–</p>

<p>The which the gods protect thee from–may ’t</p>

<p>defend thee.”</p>

<p>It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it,</p>

<p>Till the rough seas, that spares not any man,</p>

<p>Took it in rage, though calmed have given ’t again.</p>

<p>I thank thee for ’t; my shipwrack now’s no ill</p>

<p>Since I have here my father gave in his will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  What mean you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,</p>

<p>For it was sometime target to a king;</p>

<p>I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,</p>

<p>And for his sake I wish the having of it,</p>

<p>And that you’d guide me to your sovereign’s court,</p>

<p>Where with it I may appear a gentleman.</p>

<p>And if that ever my low fortune’s better,</p>

<p>I’ll pay your bounties; till then, rest your debtor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>I’ll show the virtue I have borne in arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Why, do ’ee take it, and the gods give</p>

<p>thee good on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  Ay, but hark you, my friend, ’twas</p>

<p>we that made up this garment through the rough</p>

<p>seams of the waters. There are certain condolements,</p>

<p>certain vails. I hope, sir, if you thrive, you’ll</p>

<p>remember from whence you had them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Believe ’t, I will.     <i><i>[He puts on the armor.]</i></i></p>

<p>By your furtherance I am clothed in steel,</p>

<p>And spite of all the rupture of the sea,</p>

<p>This jewel holds his biding on my arm.</p>

<p>Unto thy value I will mount myself</p>

<p>Upon a courser, whose delightful steps</p>

<p>Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.</p>

<p>Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided</p>

<p>Of a pair of bases.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Fisherman</span>  We’ll sure provide. Thou shalt have</p>

<p>my best gown to make thee a pair; and I’ll bring</p>

<p>thee to the court myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>Then honor be but a goal to my will;</p>

<p>This day I’ll rise or else add ill to ill.</p>
