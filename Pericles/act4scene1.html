<p><center><i>[Enter Dionyza with Leonine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span></p>

<p>Thy oath remember. Thou hast sworn to do ’t.</p>

<p>’Tis but a blow which never shall be known.</p>

<p>Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon</p>

<p>To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,</p>

<p>Which is but cold in flaming, thy bosom inflame</p>

<p>Too nicely. Nor let pity, which even women</p>

<p>Have cast off, melt thee; but be a soldier</p>

<p>To thy purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonine</span>  I will do ’t; but yet</p>

<p>She is a goodly creature.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span>  The fitter, then,</p>

<p>The gods should have her. Here she comes weeping</p>

<p>For her only mistress’ death. Thou art resolved?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonine</span>  I am resolved.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Marina with a basket of flowers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>No, I will rob Tellus of her weed</p>

<p>To strew thy green with flowers. The yellows, blues,</p>

<p>The purple violets and marigolds</p>

<p>Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave</p>

<p>While summer days doth last. Ay me, poor maid,</p>

<p>Born in a tempest when my mother died,</p>

<p>This world to me is as a lasting storm,</p>

<p>Whirring me from my friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span></p>

<p>How now, Marina? Why do you keep alone?</p>

<p>How chance my daughter is not with you?</p>

<p>Do not consume your blood with sorrowing.</p>

<p>Have you a nurse of me! Lord, how your favor ’s</p>

<p>Changed with this unprofitable woe.</p>

<p>Come, give me your flowers. O’er the sea marge</p>

<p>Walk with Leonine. The air is quick there,</p>

<p>And it pierces and sharpens the stomach.–Come,</p>

<p>Leonine,</p>

<p>Take her by the arm. Walk with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  No,</p>

<p>I pray you, I’ll not bereave you of your servant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span>  Come, come.</p>

<p>I love the king your father and yourself</p>

<p>With more than foreign heart. We every day</p>

<p>Expect him here. When he shall come and find</p>

<p>Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,</p>

<p>He will repent the breadth of his great voyage,</p>

<p>Blame both my lord and me that we have taken</p>

<p>No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,</p>

<p>Walk, and be cheerful once again. Reserve</p>

<p>That excellent complexion, which did steal</p>

<p>The eyes of young and old. Care not for me.</p>

<p>I can go home alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Well, I will go,</p>

<p>But yet I have no desire to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span>  Come, come,</p>

<p>I know ’tis good for you.–Walk half an hour,</p>

<p>Leonine, at the least. Remember</p>

<p>What I have said.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonine</span>  I warrant you, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span></p>

<p>I’ll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while.</p>

<p>Pray walk softly; do not heat your blood.</p>

<p>What, I must have care of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  My thanks, sweet madam.     <i><i>[Dionyza exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Is this wind westerly that blows?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonine</span>  Southwest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>When I was born, the wind was north.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonine</span>  Was ’t so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>My father, as nurse says, did never fear,</p>

<p>But cried “Good seamen!” to the sailors,</p>

<p>Galling his kingly hands haling ropes,</p>

<p>And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea</p>

<p>That almost burst the deck.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonine</span>  When was this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  When I was born.</p>

<p>Never was waves nor wind more violent,</p>

<p>And from the ladder-tackle washes off</p>

<p>A canvas-climber. “Ha!” says one, “Wolt out?”</p>

<p>And with a dropping industry they skip</p>

<p>From stern to stern. The Boatswain whistles, and</p>

<p>The Master calls and trebles their confusion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonine</span>  Come, say your prayers.</p>

<p><center><i>[He draws his sword.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  What mean you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonine</span></p>

<p>If you require a little space for prayer,</p>

<p>I grant it. Pray, but be not tedious, for</p>

<p>The gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn</p>

<p>To do my work with haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Why will you kill me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonine</span>  To satisfy my lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span>  Why would she have me killed?</p>

<p>Now, as I can remember, by my troth,</p>

<p>I never did her hurt in all my life.</p>

<p>I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn</p>

<p>To any living creature. Believe me, la,</p>

<p>I never killed a mouse, nor hurt a fly.</p>

<p>I trod upon a worm against my will,</p>

<p>But I wept for ’t. How have I offended</p>

<p>Wherein my death might yield her any profit</p>

<p>Or my life imply her any danger?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonine</span>  My commission</p>

<p>Is not to reason of the deed, but do ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Marina</span></p>

<p>You will not do ’t for all the world, I hope.</p>

<p>You are well-favored, and your looks foreshow</p>

<p>You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately</p>

<p>When you caught hurt in parting two that fought.</p>

<p>Good sooth, it showed well in you. Do so now.</p>

<p>Your lady seeks my life. Come you between,</p>

<p>And save poor me, the weaker.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonine</span>  I am sworn</p>

<p>And will dispatch.     <i><i>[He seizes her.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pirates.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Pirate</span>  Hold, villain!     <i><i>[Leonine runs offstage.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Pirate</span>  A prize, a prize!     <i><i>[He seizes Marina.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Pirate</span>  Half-part, mates, half-part. Come, let’s</p>

<p>have her aboard suddenly.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit, carrying Marina.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Leonine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonine</span></p>

<p>These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes,</p>

<p>And they have seized Marina. Let her go.</p>

<p>There’s no hope she will return. I’ll swear she’s dead,</p>

<p>And thrown into the sea. But I’ll see further.</p>

<p>Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,</p>

<p>Not carry her aboard. If she remain,</p>

<p>Whom they have ravished must by me be slain.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
