<p><center><i>[Enter Cerimon and Diana’s Priestesses, including</p>

<p>Thaisa; at another door enter Pericles, Marina,</p>

<p>Helicanus, Lysimachus, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Hail, Dian! To perform thy just command,</p>

<p>I here confess myself the King of Tyre,</p>

<p>Who, frighted from my country, did wed</p>

<p>At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.</p>

<p>At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth</p>

<p>A maid child called Marina, whom, O goddess,</p>

<p>Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus</p>

<p>Was nursed with Cleon, who at fourteen years</p>

<p>He sought to murder. But her better stars</p>

<p>Brought her to Mytilene, ’gainst whose shore riding,</p>

<p>Her fortunes brought the maid aboard us, where,</p>

<p>By her own most clear remembrance, she made known</p>

<p>Herself my daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc>  Voice and favor!</p>

<p>You are, you are–O royal Pericles!</p>

<p><center><i>[She falls in a faint.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>What means the nun? She dies! Help, gentlemen!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cerimon</sc>  Noble sir,</p>

<p>If you have told Diana’s altar true,</p>

<p>This is your wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc>  Reverend appearer, no.</p>

<p>I threw her overboard with these very arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cerimon</sc></p>

<p>Upon this coast, I warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc>  ’Tis most certain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cerimon</sc></p>

<p>Look to the lady. O, she’s but overjoyed.</p>

<p>Early one blustering morn this lady was</p>

<p>Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,</p>

<p>Found there rich jewels, recovered her, and placed her</p>

<p>Here in Diana’s temple.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc>  May we see them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cerimon</sc></p>

<p>Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,</p>

<p>Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa</p>

<p>Is recovered.     <i><i>[Thaisa rises.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc>  O, let me look!</p>

<p>If he be none of mine, my sanctity</p>

<p>Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,</p>

<p>But curb it, spite of seeing.–O, my lord,</p>

<p>Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,</p>

<p>Like him you are. Did you not name a tempest,</p>

<p>A birth and death?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc>  The voice of dead Thaisa!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc></p>

<p>That Thaisa am I, supposed dead</p>

<p>And drowned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Immortal Dian!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc>  Now I know you better.</p>

<p><center><i>[She points to the ring on his hand.]</i></center></p>

<p>When we with tears parted Pentapolis,</p>

<p>The king my father gave you such a ring.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>This, this! No more, you gods! Your present kindness</p>

<p>Makes my past miseries sports. You shall do well</p>

<p>That on the touching of her lips I may</p>

<p>Melt and no more be seen.–O, come, be buried</p>

<p>A second time within these arms!     <i><i>[They embrace.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marina</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i>  My heart</p>

<p>Leaps to be gone into my mother’s bosom.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Look who kneels here, flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa,</p>

<p>Thy burden at the sea, and called Marina</p>

<p>For she was yielded there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc> <i>[embracing Marina]</i>  Blessed, and mine own!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helicanus</sc></p>

<p>Hail, madam, and my queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc>  I know you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre</p>

<p>I left behind an ancient substitute.</p>

<p>Can you remember what I called the man?</p>

<p>I have named him oft.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc>  ’Twas Helicanus then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc>  Still confirmation!</p>

<p>Embrace him, dear Thaisa. This is he.</p>

<p><center><i>[They embrace.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now do I long to hear how you were found,</p>

<p>How possibly preserved, and who to thank,</p>

<p>Besides the gods, for this great miracle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc>  Lord Cerimon, my lord, this man</p>

<p>Through whom the gods have shown their power,</p>

<p>that can</p>

<p>From first to last resolve you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc>  Reverend sir,</p>

<p>The gods can have no mortal officer</p>

<p>More like a god than you. Will you deliver</p>

<p>How this dead queen relives?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cerimon</sc>  I will, my lord.</p>

<p>Beseech you, first go with me to my house,</p>

<p>Where shall be shown you all was found with her,</p>

<p>How she came placed here in the temple,</p>

<p>No needful thing omitted.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Pure Dian, I bless thee for thy vision, and</p>

<p>Will offer night oblations to thee.–Thaisa,</p>

<p>This prince, the fair betrothed of your daughter,</p>

<p>Shall marry her at Pentapolis.–And now this</p>

<p>ornament</p>

<p>Makes me look dismal will I clip to form,</p>

<p>And what this fourteen years no razor touched,</p>

<p>To grace thy marriage day I’ll beautify.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thaisa</sc></p>

<p>Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,</p>

<p>My father’s dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pericles</sc></p>

<p>Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,</p>

<p>We’ll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves</p>

<p>Will in that kingdom spend our following days.</p>

<p>Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.–</p>

<p>Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay</p>

<p>To hear the rest untold. Sir, lead ’s the way.</p>
