<p><center><i>[Enter the King, Simonides, reading of a letter at one</p>

<p>door; the Knights meet him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Knight</span></p>

<p>Good morrow to the good Simonides.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span></p>

<p>Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,</p>

<p>That for this twelvemonth she’ll not undertake</p>

<p>A married life. Her reason to herself is only known,</p>

<p>Which from her by no means can I get.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Knight</span></p>

<p>May we not get access to her, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span></p>

<p>Faith, by no means; she hath so strictly tied her</p>

<p>To her chamber that ’tis impossible.</p>

<p>One twelve moons more she’ll wear Diana’s livery.</p>

<p>This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vowed,</p>

<p>And on her virgin honor will not break it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Knight</span></p>

<p>Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Knights exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span>  So,</p>

<p>They are well dispatched. Now to my daughter’s letter.</p>

<p>She tells me here she’ll wed the stranger knight</p>

<p>Or never more to view nor day nor light.</p>

<p>’Tis well, mistress, your choice agrees with mine.</p>

<p>I like that well. Nay, how absolute she’s in ’t,</p>

<p>Not minding whether I dislike or no!</p>

<p>Well, I do commend her choice, and will no longer</p>

<p>Have it be delayed. Soft, here he comes.</p>

<p>I must dissemble it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pericles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>All fortune to the good Simonides.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span></p>

<p>To you as much. Sir, I am beholding to you</p>

<p>For your sweet music this last night. I do</p>

<p>Protest, my ears were never better fed</p>

<p>With such delightful pleasing harmony.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>It is your Grace’s pleasure to commend,</p>

<p>Not my desert.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span>  Sir, you are music’s master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span>  Let me ask you one thing:</p>

<p>What do you think of my daughter, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  A most virtuous princess.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span>  And she is fair too, is she not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span></p>

<p>Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you,</p>

<p>Ay, so well that you must be her master,</p>

<p>And she will be your scholar. Therefore, look to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span></p>

<p>She thinks not so. Peruse this writing else.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span> <i>[aside]</i>  What’s here?</p>

<p>A letter that she loves the knight of Tyre?</p>

<p>’Tis the King’s subtlety to have my life.–</p>

<p>O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,</p>

<p>A stranger and distressed gentleman</p>

<p>That never aimed so high to love your daughter,</p>

<p>But bent all offices to honor her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span></p>

<p>Thou hast bewitched my daughter, and thou art</p>

<p>A villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  By the gods, I have not!</p>

<p>Never did thought of mine levy offense;</p>

<p>Nor never did my actions yet commence</p>

<p>A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span></p>

<p>Traitor, thou liest!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span>  Traitor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span>  Ay, traitor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>Even in his throat, unless it be the King</p>

<p>That calls me traitor, I return the lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>My actions are as noble as my thoughts,</p>

<p>That never relished of a base descent.</p>

<p>I came unto your court for honor’s cause,</p>

<p>And not to be a rebel to her state,</p>

<p>And he that otherwise accounts of me,</p>

<p>This sword shall prove he’s honor’s enemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span>  No?</p>

<p>Here comes my daughter. She can witness it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Thaisa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>Then as you are as virtuous as fair,</p>

<p>Resolve your angry father if my tongue</p>

<p>Did e’er solicit or my hand subscribe</p>

<p>To any syllable that made love to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thaisa</span></p>

<p>Why, sir, say if you had, who takes offense</p>

<p>At that would make me glad?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span></p>

<p>Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?</p>

<p><i>[(Aside.)]</i> I am glad on ’t with all my heart.–</p>

<p>I’ll tame you! I’ll bring you in subjection.</p>

<p>Will you, not having my consent,</p>

<p>Bestow your love and your affections</p>

<p>Upon a stranger? <i>[(Aside.)]</i> Who, for aught I know,</p>

<p>May be–nor can I think the contrary–</p>

<p>As great in blood as I myself.–</p>

<p>Therefore, hear you, mistress: either frame</p>

<p>Your will to mine–and you, sir, hear you:</p>

<p>Either be ruled by me–or I’ll make you</p>

<p>Man and wife.</p>

<p>Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too.</p>

<p>And being joined, I’ll thus your hopes destroy.</p>

<p>And for further grief–God give you joy!</p>

<p>What, are you both pleased?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thaisa</span>  Yes, <i>[(to Pericles)]</i> if you love me, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pericles</span></p>

<p>Even as my life my blood that fosters it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span>  What, are you both agreed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span>  Yes, if ’t please your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Simonides</span></p>

<p>It pleaseth me so well that I will see you wed,</p>

<p>And then with what haste you can, get you to bed.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
