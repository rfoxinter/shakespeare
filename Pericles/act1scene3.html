<p><center><i>[Enter Thaliard alone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thaliard</span>  So this is Tyre, and this the court. Here</p>

<p>must I kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am</p>

<p>sure to be hanged at home. ’Tis dangerous. Well, I</p>

<p>perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion</p>

<p>that, being bid to ask what he would of the</p>

<p>king, desired he might know none of his secrets.</p>

<p>Now do I see he had some reason for ’t, for if a</p>

<p>king bid a man be a villain, he’s bound by the</p>

<p>indenture of his oath to be one. Husht! Here</p>

<p>comes the lords of Tyre.     <i><i>[He steps aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Helicanus and Escanes, with other Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,</p>

<p>Further to question me of your king’s departure.</p>

<p>His sealed commission left in trust with me</p>

<p>Does speak sufficiently he’s gone to travel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thaliard</span> <i>[aside]</i>  How? The King gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>If further yet you will be satisfied</p>

<p>Why, as it were, unlicensed of your loves</p>

<p>He would depart, I’ll give some light unto you.</p>

<p>Being at Antioch–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thaliard</span> <i>[aside]</i>  What from Antioch?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>Royal Antiochus, on what cause I know not,</p>

<p>Took some displeasure at him–at least he judged so;</p>

<p>And doubting lest he had erred or sinned,</p>

<p>To show his sorrow, he’d correct himself;</p>

<p>So puts himself unto the shipman’s toil,</p>

<p>With whom each minute threatens life or death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thaliard</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Well, I perceive I shall not be hanged</p>

<p>now, although I would; but since he’s gone, the</p>

<p>King’s ears it must please. He ’scaped the land to</p>

<p>perish at the sea. I’ll present myself.–Peace to the</p>

<p>lords of Tyre!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span></p>

<p>Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thaliard</span>  From him I come with message unto princely</p>

<p>Pericles, but since my landing I have understood</p>

<p>your lord has betook himself to unknown travels.</p>

<p>Now message must return from whence it came.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helicanus</span>  We have no reason to desire it,</p>

<p>Commended to our master, not to us.</p>

<p>Yet ere you shall depart, this we desire:</p>

<p>As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.</p>
