<p><center><i>[Enter Cleon and Dionyza.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span></p>

<p>Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span></p>

<p>O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter</p>

<p>The sun and moon ne’er looked upon!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span>  I think you’ll turn a child again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span></p>

<p>Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,</p>

<p>I’d give it to undo the deed. A lady</p>

<p>Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess</p>

<p>To equal any single crown o’ th’ Earth</p>

<p>I’ the justice of compare. O villain Leonine,</p>

<p>Whom thou hast poisoned too!</p>

<p>If thou hadst drunk to him, ’t had been a kindness</p>

<p>Becoming well thy face. What canst thou say</p>

<p>When noble Pericles shall demand his child?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span></p>

<p>That she is dead. Nurses are not the Fates.</p>

<p>To foster is not ever to preserve.</p>

<p>She died at night; I’ll say so. Who can cross it</p>

<p>Unless you play the impious innocent</p>

<p>And, for an honest attribute, cry out</p>

<p>“She died by foul play!”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span>  O, go to. Well, well,</p>

<p>Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods</p>

<p>Do like this worst.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span>  Be one of those that thinks</p>

<p>The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence</p>

<p>And open this to Pericles. I do shame</p>

<p>To think of what a noble strain you are,</p>

<p>And of how coward a spirit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span>  To such proceeding</p>

<p>Whoever but his approbation added,</p>

<p>Though not his prime consent, he did not flow</p>

<p>From honorable courses.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span>  Be it so, then.</p>

<p>Yet none does know but you how she came dead,</p>

<p>Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.</p>

<p>She did distain my child and stood between</p>

<p>Her and her fortunes. None would look on her,</p>

<p>But cast their gazes on Marina’s face,</p>

<p>Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin</p>

<p>Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through,</p>

<p>And though you call my course unnatural,</p>

<p>You not your child well loving, yet I find</p>

<p>It greets me as an enterprise of kindness</p>

<p>Performed to your sole daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span>  Heavens forgive it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span>  And as for Pericles,</p>

<p>What should he say? We wept after her hearse,</p>

<p>And yet we mourn. Her monument is</p>

<p>Almost finished, and her epitaphs</p>

<p>In glitt’ring golden characters express</p>

<p>A general praise to her, and care in us</p>

<p>At whose expense ’tis done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cleon</span>  Thou art like the Harpy,</p>

<p>Which, to betray, dost with thine angel’s face</p>

<p>Seize with thine eagle’s talons.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dionyza</span></p>

<p>You’re like one that superstitiously</p>

<p>Do swear to the gods that winter kills the flies.</p>

<p>But yet I know you’ll do as I advise.</p>
