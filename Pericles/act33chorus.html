<p><span class='sc'>Gower</span></p>

<p>Now sleep yslacked hath the rout;</p>

<p>No din but snores about the house,</p>

<p>Made louder by the o’erfed breast</p>

<p>Of this most pompous marriage feast.</p>

<p>The cat with eyne of burning coal</p>

<p>Now couches from the mouse’s hole,</p>

<p>And crickets sing at the oven’s mouth</p>

<p>Are the blither for their drouth.</p>

<p>Hymen hath brought the bride to bed,</p>

<p>Where, by the loss of maidenhead,</p>

<p>A babe is molded. Be attent,</p>

<p>And time that is so briefly spent</p>

<p>With your fine fancies quaintly eche.</p>

<p>What’s dumb in show I’ll plain with speech.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Dumb Show.</p>

<br/>

<p>Enter Pericles and Simonides at one door with</p>

<p>Attendants. A Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives</p>

<p>Pericles a letter. Pericles shows it Simonides. The Lords</p>

<p>kneel to him; then enter Thaisa with child, with</p>

<p>Lychorida, a nurse. The King shows her the letter. She</p>

<p>rejoices. She and Pericles take leave of her father, and</p>

<p>depart with Lychorida and their Attendants. Then</p>

<p>Simonides and the others exit.</p>

<p>]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>By many a dern and painful perch</p>

<p>Of Pericles the careful search,</p>

<p>By the four opposing coigns</p>

<p>Which the world together joins,</p>

<p>Is made with all due diligence</p>

<p>That horse and sail and high expense</p>

<p>Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,</p>

<p>Fame answering the most strange enquire,</p>

<p>To th’ court of King Simonides</p>

<p>Are letters brought, the tenor these:</p>

<p>Antiochus and his daughter dead,</p>

<p>The men of Tyrus on the head</p>

<p>Of Helicanus would set on</p>

<p>The crown of Tyre, but he will none.</p>

<p>The mutiny he there hastes t’ oppress,</p>

<p>Says to ’em, if King Pericles</p>

<p>Come not home in twice six moons,</p>

<p>He, obedient to their dooms,</p>

<p>Will take the crown. The sum of this,</p>

<p>Brought hither to Pentapolis,</p>

<p>Y-ravished the regions round,</p>

<p>And everyone with claps can sound,</p>

<p>“Our heir apparent is a king!</p>

<p>Who dreamt, who thought of such a thing?”</p>

<p>Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre.</p>

<p>His queen, with child, makes her desire–</p>

<p>Which who shall cross?–along to go.</p>

<p>Omit we all their dole and woe.</p>

<p>Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,</p>

<p>And so to sea. Their vessel shakes</p>

<p>On Neptune’s billow. Half the flood</p>

<p>Hath their keel cut. But Fortune, moved,</p>

<p>Varies again. The grizzled North</p>

<p>Disgorges such a tempest forth</p>

<p>That, as a duck for life that dives,</p>

<p>So up and down the poor ship drives.</p>

<p>The lady shrieks and, well-anear,</p>

<p>Does fall in travail with her fear.</p>

<p>And what ensues in this fell storm</p>

<p>Shall for itself itself perform.</p>

<p>I nill relate; action may</p>

<p>Conveniently the rest convey,</p>

<p>Which might not what by me is told.</p>

<p>In your imagination hold</p>

<p>This stage the ship upon whose deck</p>

<p>The sea-tossed Pericles appears to speak.</p>
