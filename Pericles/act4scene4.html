<p>Thus time we waste, and long leagues make short,</p>

<p>Sail seas in cockles, have and wish but for ’t,</p>

<p>Making to take our imagination</p>

<p>From bourn to bourn, region to region.</p>

<p>By you being pardoned, we commit no crime</p>

<p>To use one language in each several clime</p>

<p>Where our scenes seems to live. I do beseech you</p>

<p>To learn of me, who stand in the gaps to teach you</p>

<p>The stages of our story. Pericles</p>

<p>Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,</p>

<p>Attended on by many a lord and knight,</p>

<p>To see his daughter, all his life’s delight.</p>

<p>Old Helicanus goes along. Behind</p>

<p>Is left to govern it, you bear in mind,</p>

<p>Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late</p>

<p>Advanced in time to great and high estate.</p>

<p>Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought</p>

<p>This king to Tarsus–think his pilot thought;</p>

<p>So with his steerage shall your thoughts go on–</p>

<p>To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.</p>

<p>Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;</p>

<p>Your ears unto your eyes I’ll reconcile.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Dumb Show.</p>

<br/>

<p>Enter Pericles at one door, with all his train, Cleon and</p>

<p>Dionyza at the other. Cleon shows Pericles the tomb,</p>

<p>whereat Pericles makes lamentation, puts on sackcloth,</p>

<p>and in a mighty passion departs. Cleon and Dionyza exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>See how belief may suffer by foul show!</p>

<p>This borrowed passion stands for true old woe.</p>

<p>And Pericles, in sorrow all devoured,</p>

<p>With sighs shot through and biggest tears</p>

<p>o’ershowered,</p>

<p>Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears</p>

<p>Never to wash his face nor cut his hairs.</p>

<p>He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears</p>

<p>A tempest which his mortal vessel tears,</p>

<p>And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit</p>

<p>The epitaph is for Marina writ</p>

<p>By wicked Dionyza:</p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>The fairest, sweetest, and best lies here,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Who withered in her spring of year.</i></p>

<p>     <i>She was of Tyrus, the King’s daughter,</i></p>

<p>     <i>On whom foul death hath made this slaughter.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Marina was she called, and at her birth,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Thetis, being proud, swallowed some part o’ th’ earth.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Therefore the Earth, fearing to be o’erflowed,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Hath Thetis’ birth-child on the heavens bestowed.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Wherefore she does–and swears she’ll never stint–</i></p>

<p>     <i>Make raging battery upon shores of flint.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>No visor does become black villainy</p>

<p>So well as soft and tender flattery.</p>

<p>Let Pericles believe his daughter’s dead,</p>

<p>And bear his courses to be ordered</p>

<p>By Lady Fortune, while our scene must play</p>

<p>His daughter’s woe and heavy welladay</p>

<p>In her unholy service. Patience, then,</p>
