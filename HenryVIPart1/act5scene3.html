<p><center><i>[Alarum. Excursions. Enter Joan la Pucelle.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pucelle</span></p>

<p>The Regent conquers and the Frenchmen fly.</p>

<p>Now help, you charming spells and periapts,</p>

<p>And you choice spirits that admonish me,</p>

<p>And give me signs of future accidents.     <i><i>[Thunder.]</i></i></p>

<p>You speedy helpers, that are substitutes</p>

<p>Under the lordly monarch of the north,</p>

<p>Appear, and aid me in this enterprise.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fiends.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>This speed and quick appearance argues proof</p>

<p>Of your accustomed diligence to me.</p>

<p>Now, you familiar spirits that are culled</p>

<p>Out of the powerful regions under earth,</p>

<p>Help me this once, that France may get the field.</p>

<p><center><i>[They walk, and speak not.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, hold me not with silence overlong!</p>

<p>Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,</p>

<p>I’ll lop a member off and give it you</p>

<p>In earnest of a further benefit,</p>

<p>So you do condescend to help me now.</p>

<p><center><i>[They hang their heads.]</i></center></p>

<p>No hope to have redress? My body shall</p>

<p>Pay recompense if you will grant my suit.</p>

<p><center><i>[They shake their heads.]</i></center></p>

<p>Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice</p>

<p>Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?</p>

<p>Then take my soul–my body, soul, and all–</p>

<p>Before that England give the French the foil.</p>

<p><center><i>[They depart.]</i></center></p>

<p>See, they forsake me. Now the time is come</p>

<p>That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest</p>

<p>And let her head fall into England’s lap.</p>

<p>My ancient incantations are too weak,</p>

<p>And hell too strong for me to buckle with.</p>

<p>Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Excursions. Burgundy and York fight hand to hand.</p>

<p>Burgundy and the French fly as York and English</p>

<p>soldiers capture Joan la Pucelle.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Damsel of France, I think I have you fast.</p>

<p>Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms,</p>

<p>And try if they can gain your liberty.</p>

<p>A goodly prize, fit for the devil’s grace!</p>

<p>See how the ugly witch doth bend her brows</p>

<p>As if with Circe she would change my shape.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pucelle</span></p>

<p>Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man;</p>

<p>No shape but his can please your dainty eye.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pucelle</span></p>

<p>A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee,</p>

<p>And may you both be suddenly surprised</p>

<p>By bloody hands in sleeping on your beds!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Fell banning hag! Enchantress, hold thy tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pucelle</span></p>

<p>I prithee give me leave to curse awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Curse, miscreant, when thou com’st to the stake.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Alarum. Enter Suffolk with Margaret in his hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gazes on her.]</i></center></p>

<p>O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly,</p>

<p>For I will touch thee but with reverent hands.</p>

<p>I kiss these fingers for eternal peace</p>

<p>And lay them gently on thy tender side.</p>

<p>Who art thou? Say, that I may honor thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,</p>

<p>The King of Naples, whosoe’er thou art.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>An earl I am, and Suffolk am I called.</p>

<p>Be not offended, nature’s miracle;</p>

<p>Thou art allotted to be ta’en by me.</p>

<p>So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,</p>

<p>Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.</p>

<p>Yet if this servile usage once offend,</p>

<p>Go and be free again as Suffolk’s friend.</p>

<p><center><i>[She is going.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, stay! <i>[(Aside.)]</i> I have no power to let her pass.</p>

<p>My hand would free her, but my heart says no.</p>

<p>As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,</p>

<p>Twinkling another counterfeited beam,</p>

<p>So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.</p>

<p>Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak.</p>

<p>I’ll call for pen and ink and write my mind.</p>

<p>Fie, de la Pole, disable not thyself!</p>

<p>Hast not a tongue? Is she not here?</p>

<p>Wilt thou be daunted at a woman’s sight?</p>

<p>Ay. Beauty’s princely majesty is such</p>

<p>Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Say, Earl of Suffolk, if thy name be so,</p>

<p>What ransom must I pay before I pass?</p>

<p>For I perceive I am thy prisoner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit</p>

<p>Before thou make a trial of her love?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Why speak’st thou not? What ransom must I pay?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>She’s beautiful, and therefore to be wooed;</p>

<p>She is a woman, therefore to be won.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Wilt thou accept of ransom, yea or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife;</p>

<p>Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>There all is marred; there lies a cooling card.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>He talks at random; sure the man is mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>And yet a dispensation may be had.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>And yet I would that you would answer me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I’ll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?</p>

<p>Why, for my king. Tush, that’s a wooden thing!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>He talks of wood. It is some carpenter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,</p>

<p>And peace established between these realms.</p>

<p>But there remains a scruple in that, too;</p>

<p>For though her father be the King of Naples,</p>

<p>Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,</p>

<p>And our nobility will scorn the match.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Hear you, captain? Are you not at leisure?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>It shall be so, disdain they ne’er so much.</p>

<p>Henry is youthful, and will quickly yield.–</p>

<p>Madam, I have a secret to reveal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>What though I be enthralled, he seems a knight,</p>

<p>And will not any way dishonor me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French,</p>

<p>And then I need not crave his courtesy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Sweet madam, give me hearing in a cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Tush, women have been captivate ere now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Lady, wherefore talk you so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>I cry you mercy, ’tis but quid for quo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose</p>

<p>Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>To be a queen in bondage is more vile</p>

<p>Than is a slave in base servility,</p>

<p>For princes should be free.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  And so shall you,</p>

<p>If happy England’s royal king be free.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>I’ll undertake to make thee Henry’s queen,</p>

<p>To put a golden scepter in thy hand</p>

<p>And set a precious crown upon thy head,</p>

<p>If thou wilt condescend to be my–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  What?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  His love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>I am unworthy to be Henry’s wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>No, gentle madam, I unworthy am</p>

<p>To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,</p>

<p>And have no portion in the choice myself.</p>

<p>How say you, madam? Are you so content?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>An if my father please, I am content.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Then call our captains and our colors forth!</p>

<p><center><i>[A Soldier exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>And, madam, at your father’s castle walls</p>

<p>We’ll crave a parley to confer with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Captains and Trumpets. Sound a parley.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Enter Reignier on the walls.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>See, Reignier, see thy daughter prisoner!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reignier</span></p>

<p>To whom?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  To me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reignier</span>  Suffolk, what remedy?</p>

<p>I am a soldier and unapt to weep</p>

<p>Or to exclaim on Fortune’s fickleness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:</p>

<p>Consent, and, for thy Honor give consent,</p>

<p>Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,</p>

<p>Whom I with pain have wooed and won thereto;</p>

<p>And this her easy-held imprisonment</p>

<p>Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reignier</span></p>

<p>Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  Fair Margaret knows</p>

<p>That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reignier</span></p>

<p>Upon thy princely warrant, I descend</p>

<p>To give thee answer of thy just demand.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits from the walls.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>And here I will expect thy coming.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Trumpets sound. Enter Reignier, below.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reignier</span></p>

<p>Welcome, brave earl, into our territories.</p>

<p>Command in Anjou what your Honor pleases.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,</p>

<p>Fit to be made companion with a king.</p>

<p>What answer makes your Grace unto my suit?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reignier</span></p>

<p>Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth</p>

<p>To be the princely bride of such a lord,</p>

<p>Upon condition I may quietly</p>

<p>Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,</p>

<p>Free from oppression or the stroke of war,</p>

<p>My daughter shall be Henry’s, if he please.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>That is her ransom; I deliver her,</p>

<p>And those two counties I will undertake</p>

<p>Your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reignier</span></p>

<p>And I, again in Henry’s royal name</p>

<p>As deputy unto that gracious king,</p>

<p>Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks</p>

<p>Because this is in traffic of a king.</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> And yet methinks I could be well content</p>

<p>To be mine own attorney in this case.–</p>

<p>I’ll over then to England with this news,</p>

<p>And make this marriage to be solemnized.</p>

<p>So farewell, Reignier; set this diamond safe</p>

<p>In golden palaces, as it becomes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reignier</span> <i>[embracing Suffolk]</i></p>

<p>I do embrace thee, as I would embrace</p>

<p>The Christian prince King Henry, were he here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[to Suffolk]</i></p>

<p>Farewell, my lord; good wishes, praise, and prayers</p>

<p>Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.</p>

<p><center><i>[She is going, as Reignier exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Farewell, sweet madam. But, hark you, Margaret,</p>

<p>No princely commendations to my king?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Such commendations as becomes a maid,</p>

<p>A virgin, and his servant, say to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.</p>

<p>But, madam, I must trouble you again:</p>

<p>No loving token to his Majesty?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes, my good lord: a pure unspotted heart,</p>

<p>Never yet taint with love, I send the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  And this withal.     <i><i>[Kiss her.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>That for thyself. I will not so presume</p>

<p>To send such peevish tokens to a king.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay.</p>

<p>Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth.</p>

<p>There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.</p>

<p>Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise;</p>

<p>Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount</p>

<p>And natural graces that extinguish art;</p>

<p>Repeat their semblance often on the seas,</p>

<p>That, when thou com’st to kneel at Henry’s feet,</p>

<p>Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.</p>
