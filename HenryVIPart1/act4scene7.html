<p><center><i>[Alarum. Excursions. Enter old Talbot</p>

<p>led by a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Where is my other life? Mine own is gone.</p>

<p>O, where’s young Talbot? Where is valiant John?</p>

<p>Triumphant Death, smeared with captivity,</p>

<p>Young Talbot’s valor makes me smile at thee.</p>

<p>When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,</p>

<p>His bloody sword he brandished over me,</p>

<p>And like a hungry lion did commence</p>

<p>Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;</p>

<p>But when my angry guardant stood alone,</p>

<p>Tend’ring my ruin and assailed of none,</p>

<p>Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart</p>

<p>Suddenly made him from my side to start</p>

<p>Into the clust’ring battle of the French;</p>

<p>And in that sea of blood, my boy did drench</p>

<p>His over-mounting spirit; and there died</p>

<p>My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Soldiers with John Talbot, borne.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span></p>

<p>O, my dear lord, lo where your son is borne!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Thou antic Death, which laugh’st us here to scorn,</p>

<p>Anon from thy insulting tyranny,</p>

<p>Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,</p>

<p>Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,</p>

<p>In thy despite shall scape mortality.–</p>

<p>O, thou whose wounds become hard-favored Death,</p>

<p>Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!</p>

<p>Brave Death by speaking, whither he will or no.</p>

<p>Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.–</p>

<p>Poor boy, he smiles, methinks, as who should say</p>

<p>“Had Death been French, then Death had died</p>

<p>today.”–</p>

<p>Come, come, and lay him in his father’s arms;</p>

<p>My spirit can no longer bear these harms.</p>

<p>Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,</p>

<p>Now my old arms are young John Talbot’s grave.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dies.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Alarums. Soldiers exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Charles, Alanson, Burgundy, Bastard,</p>

<p>and Pucelle, with Forces.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charles</span></p>

<p>Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,</p>

<p>We should have found a bloody day of this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>How the young whelp of Talbot’s, raging wood,</p>

<p>Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen’s blood!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pucelle</span></p>

<p>Once I encountered him, and thus I said:</p>

<p>“Thou maiden youth, be vanquished by a maid.”</p>

<p>But with a proud majestical high scorn</p>

<p>He answered thus: “Young Talbot was not born</p>

<p>To be the pillage of a giglot wench.”</p>

<p>So, rushing in the bowels of the French,</p>

<p>He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Burgundy</span></p>

<p>Doubtless he would have made a noble knight.</p>

<p>See where he lies inhearsed in the arms</p>

<p>Of the most bloody nurser of his harms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bastard</span></p>

<p>Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder,</p>

<p>Whose life was England’s glory, Gallia’s wonder.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charles</span></p>

<p>O, no, forbear! For that which we have fled</p>

<p>During the life, let us not wrong it dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucy with Attendants and a French Herald.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucy</span></p>

<p>Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin’s tent,</p>

<p>To know who hath obtained the glory of the day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charles</span></p>

<p>On what submissive message art thou sent?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucy</span></p>

<p>Submission, dauphin? ’Tis a mere French word.</p>

<p>We English warriors wot not what it means.</p>

<p>I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta’en,</p>

<p>And to survey the bodies of the dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charles</span></p>

<p>For prisoners askst thou? Hell our prison is.</p>

<p>But tell me whom thou seek’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucy</span></p>

<p>But where’s the great Alcides of the field,</p>

<p>Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,</p>

<p>Created for his rare success in arms</p>

<p>Great Earl of Washford, Waterford, and Valence,</p>

<p>Lord Talbot of Goodrich and Urchinfield,</p>

<p>Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdon of Alton,</p>

<p>Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of</p>

<p>Sheffield,</p>

<p>The thrice victorious Lord of Falconbridge,</p>

<p>Knight of the noble Order of Saint George,</p>

<p>Worthy Saint Michael, and the Golden Fleece,</p>

<p>Great Marshal to Henry the Sixth</p>

<p>Of all his wars within the realm of France?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pucelle</span></p>

<p>Here’s a silly stately style indeed.</p>

<p>The Turk, that two-and-fifty kingdoms hath,</p>

<p>Writes not so tedious a style as this.</p>

<p>Him that thou magnifi’st with all these titles</p>

<p>Stinking and flyblown lies here at our feet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucy</span></p>

<p>Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen’s only scourge,</p>

<p>Your kingdom’s terror and black Nemesis?</p>

<p>O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turned</p>

<p>That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!</p>

<p>O, that I could but call these dead to life,</p>

<p>It were enough to fright the realm of France.</p>

<p>Were but his picture left amongst you here,</p>

<p>It would amaze the proudest of you all.</p>

<p>Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence</p>

<p>And give them burial as beseems their worth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pucelle</span></p>

<p>I think this upstart is old Talbot’s ghost,</p>

<p>He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.</p>

<p>For God’s sake, let him have him. To keep them here,</p>

<p>They would but stink and putrefy the air.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charles</span></p>

<p>Go, take their bodies hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucy</span>  I’ll bear them hence.</p>

<p>But from their ashes shall be reared</p>

<p>A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Charles</span></p>

<p>So we be rid of them, do with him what thou wilt.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lucy, Servant, and Attendants exit,</p>

<p>bearing the bodies.]</i></center></p>

<p>And now to Paris in this conquering vein.</p>

<p>All will be ours, now bloody Talbot’s slain.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
