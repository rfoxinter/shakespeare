<p><center><i>[Enter Charles, Bastard, Alanson, Pucelle, and Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Dismay not, princes, at this accident,</p>

<p>Nor grieve that Roan is so recovered.</p>

<p>Care is no cure, but rather corrosive</p>

<p>For things that are not to be remedied.</p>

<p>Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while,</p>

<p>And like a peacock sweep along his tail;</p>

<p>We’ll pull his plumes and take away his train,</p>

<p>If dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>We have been guided by thee hitherto,</p>

<p>And of thy cunning had no diffidence.</p>

<p>One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc> <i>[to Pucelle]</i></p>

<p>Search out thy wit for secret policies,</p>

<p>And we will make thee famous through the world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc> <i>[to Pucelle]</i></p>

<p>We’ll set thy statue in some holy place</p>

<p>And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint.</p>

<p>Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:</p>

<p>By fair persuasions mixed with sugared words</p>

<p>We will entice the Duke of Burgundy</p>

<p>To leave the Talbot and to follow us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,</p>

<p>France were no place for Henry’s warriors,</p>

<p>Nor should that nation boast it so with us,</p>

<p>But be extirped from our provinces.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc></p>

<p>Forever should they be expulsed from France,</p>

<p>And not have title of an earldom here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Your honors shall perceive how I will work</p>

<p>To bring this matter to the wished end.</p>

<p><center><i>[Drum sounds afar off.]</i></center></p>

<p>Hark! By the sound of drum you may perceive</p>

<p>Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here sound an English march.]</i></center></p>

<p>There goes the Talbot with his colors spread,</p>

<p>And all the troops of English after him.</p>

<p><center><i>[French march.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now in the rearward comes the Duke and his.</p>

<p>Fortune in favor makes him lag behind.</p>

<p>Summon a parley; we will talk with him.</p>

<p><center><i>[Trumpets sound a parley.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Burgundy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc></p>

<p>Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc></p>

<p>What say’st thou, Charles?–for I am marching hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc> <i>[aside to Pucelle]</i></p>

<p>Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France,</p>

<p>Stay; let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc></p>

<p>Speak on, but be not over-tedious.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Look on thy country, look on fertile France,</p>

<p>And see the cities and the towns defaced</p>

<p>By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.</p>

<p>As looks the mother on her lowly babe</p>

<p>When death doth close his tender-dying eyes,</p>

<p>See, see the pining malady of France:</p>

<p>Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,</p>

<p>Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast.</p>

<p>O, turn thy edged sword another way;</p>

<p>Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.</p>

<p>One drop of blood drawn from thy country’s bosom</p>

<p>Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore.</p>

<p>Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,</p>

<p>And wash away thy country’s stained spots.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Either she hath bewitched me with her words,</p>

<p>Or nature makes me suddenly relent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,</p>

<p>Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.</p>

<p>Who join’st thou with but with a lordly nation</p>

<p>That will not trust thee but for profit’s sake?</p>

<p>When Talbot hath set footing once in France</p>

<p>And fashioned thee that instrument of ill,</p>

<p>Who then but English Henry will be lord,</p>

<p>And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?</p>

<p>Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof:</p>

<p>Was not the Duke of Orleance thy foe?</p>

<p>And was he not in England prisoner?</p>

<p>But when they heard he was thine enemy,</p>

<p>They set him free, without his ransom paid,</p>

<p>In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.</p>

<p>See then, thou fight’st against thy countrymen,</p>

<p>And join’st with them will be thy slaughtermen.</p>

<p>Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord.</p>

<p>Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I am vanquished. These haughty words of hers</p>

<p>Have battered me like roaring cannon-shot,</p>

<p>And made me almost yield upon my knees.–</p>

<p>Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen;</p>

<p>And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace.</p>

<p><center><i>[He embraces Charles, Bastard, and Alanson.]</i></center></p>

<p>My forces and my power of men are yours.</p>

<p>So, farewell, Talbot. I’ll no longer trust thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Done like a Frenchman: turn and turn again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Welcome, brave duke. Thy friendship makes us fresh.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>And doth beget new courage in our breasts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc></p>

<p>Pucelle hath bravely played her part in this</p>

<p>And doth deserve a coronet of gold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,</p>

<p>And seek how we may prejudice the foe.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
