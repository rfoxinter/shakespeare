<p><center><i>[Enter Talbot, Bedford, Burgundy, a Captain and Others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bedford</span></p>

<p>The day begins to break and night is fled,</p>

<p>Whose pitchy mantle over-veiled the Earth.</p>

<p>Here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit.</p>

<p><center><i>[Retreat sounded.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,</p>

<p>And here advance it in the marketplace,</p>

<p>The middle center of this cursed town.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Soldiers enter bearing the body of Salisbury,</p>

<p>Drums beating a dead march.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now have I paid my vow unto his soul:</p>

<p>For every drop of blood was drawn from him</p>

<p>There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.</p>

<p>And, that hereafter ages may behold</p>

<p>What ruin happened in revenge of him,</p>

<p>Within their chiefest temple I’ll erect</p>

<p>A tomb wherein his corpse shall be interred,</p>

<p>Upon the which, that everyone may read,</p>

<p>Shall be engraved the sack of Orleance,</p>

<p>The treacherous manner of his mournful death,</p>

<p>And what a terror he had been to France.</p>

<p><center><i>[Funeral exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,</p>

<p>I muse we met not with the Dauphin’s grace,</p>

<p>His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,</p>

<p>Nor any of his false confederates.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bedford</span></p>

<p>’Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,</p>

<p>Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,</p>

<p>They did amongst the troops of armed men</p>

<p>Leap o’er the walls for refuge in the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Burgundy</span></p>

<p>Myself, as far as I could well discern</p>

<p>For smoke and dusky vapors of the night,</p>

<p>Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,</p>

<p>When arm-in-arm they both came swiftly running,</p>

<p>Like to a pair of loving turtledoves</p>

<p>That could not live asunder day or night.</p>

<p>After that things are set in order here,</p>

<p>We’ll follow them with all the power we have.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>All hail, my lords. Which of this princely train</p>

<p>Call you the warlike Talbot, for his acts</p>

<p>So much applauded through the realm of France?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Here is the Talbot. Who would speak with him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,</p>

<p>With modesty admiring thy renown,</p>

<p>By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe</p>

<p>To visit her poor castle where she lies,</p>

<p>That she may boast she hath beheld the man</p>

<p>Whose glory fills the world with loud report.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Burgundy</span></p>

<p>Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars</p>

<p>Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,</p>

<p>When ladies crave to be encountered with.</p>

<p>You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Ne’er trust me, then; for when a world of men</p>

<p>Could not prevail with all their oratory,</p>

<p>Yet hath a woman’s kindness overruled.–</p>

<p>And therefore tell her I return great thanks,</p>

<p>And in submission will attend on her.–</p>

<p>Will not your Honors bear me company?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bedford</span></p>

<p>No, truly, ’tis more than manners will;</p>

<p>And I have heard it said unbidden guests</p>

<p>Are often welcomest when they are gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Well then, alone, since there’s no remedy,</p>

<p>I mean to prove this lady’s courtesy.–</p>

<p>Come hither, captain.     <i><i>[Whispers.]</i></i></p>

<p>You perceive my mind?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Captain</span></p>

<p>I do, my lord, and mean accordingly.</p>
