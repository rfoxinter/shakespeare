<p><center><i>[Enter Suffolk in conference with the King,</p>

<p>Gloucester, and Exeter, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,</p>

<p>Of beauteous Margaret hath astonished me.</p>

<p>Her virtues graced with external gifts</p>

<p>Do breed love’s settled passions in my heart,</p>

<p>And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts</p>

<p>Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,</p>

<p>So am I driven by breath of her renown</p>

<p>Either to suffer shipwrack, or arrive</p>

<p>Where I may have fruition of her love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale</p>

<p>Is but a preface of her worthy praise.</p>

<p>The chief perfections of that lovely dame,</p>

<p>Had I sufficient skill to utter them,</p>

<p>Would make a volume of enticing lines</p>

<p>Able to ravish any dull conceit;</p>

<p>And, which is more, she is not so divine,</p>

<p>So full replete with choice of all delights,</p>

<p>But with as humble lowliness of mind</p>

<p>She is content to be at your command–</p>

<p>Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents–</p>

<p>To love and honor Henry as her lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>And otherwise will Henry ne’er presume.–</p>

<p>Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent</p>

<p>That Margaret may be England’s royal queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>So should I give consent to flatter sin.</p>

<p>You know, my lord, your Highness is betrothed</p>

<p>Unto another lady of esteem.</p>

<p>How shall we then dispense with that contract</p>

<p>And not deface your honor with reproach?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;</p>

<p>Or one that, at a triumph having vowed</p>

<p>To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists</p>

<p>By reason of his adversary’s odds.</p>

<p>A poor earl’s daughter is unequal odds,</p>

<p>And therefore may be broke without offense.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?</p>

<p>Her father is no better than an earl,</p>

<p>Although in glorious titles he excel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Yes, my lord, her father is a king,</p>

<p>The King of Naples and Jerusalem,</p>

<p>And of such great authority in France</p>

<p>As his alliance will confirm our peace,</p>

<p>And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,</p>

<p>Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>Besides, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,</p>

<p>Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>A dower, my lords? Disgrace not so your king</p>

<p>That he should be so abject, base, and poor,</p>

<p>To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.</p>

<p>Henry is able to enrich his queen,</p>

<p>And not to seek a queen to make him rich;</p>

<p>So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</p>

<p>As market men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</p>

<p>Marriage is a matter of more worth</p>

<p>Than to be dealt in by attorneyship.</p>

<p>Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,</p>

<p>Must be companion of his nuptial bed.</p>

<p>And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</p>

<p>Most of all these reasons bindeth us</p>

<p>In our opinions she should be preferred.</p>

<p>For what is wedlock forced but a hell,</p>

<p>An age of discord and continual strife?</p>

<p>Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss</p>

<p>And is a pattern of celestial peace.</p>

<p>Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</p>

<p>But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</p>

<p>Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,</p>

<p>Approves her fit for none but for a king.</p>

<p>Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,</p>

<p>More than in women commonly is seen,</p>

<p>Will answer our hope in issue of a king.</p>

<p>For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</p>

<p>Is likely to beget more conquerors,</p>

<p>If with a lady of so high resolve</p>

<p>As is fair Margaret he be linked in love.</p>

<p>Then yield, my lords, and here conclude with me</p>

<p>That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Whether it be through force of your report,</p>

<p>My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that</p>

<p>My tender youth was never yet attaint</p>

<p>With any passion of inflaming love,</p>

<p>I cannot tell; but this I am assured:</p>

<p>I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,</p>

<p>Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</p>

<p>As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</p>

<p>Take therefore shipping; post, my lord, to France;</p>

<p>Agree to any covenants, and procure</p>

<p>That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</p>

<p>To cross the seas to England and be crowned</p>

<p>King Henry’s faithful and anointed queen.</p>

<p>For your expenses and sufficient charge,</p>

<p>Among the people gather up a tenth.</p>

<p>Be gone, I say, for till you do return,</p>

<p>I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.–</p>

<p>And you, good uncle, banish all offense.</p>

<p>If you do censure me by what you were,</p>

<p>Not what you are, I know it will excuse</p>

<p>This sudden execution of my will.</p>

<p>And so conduct me where, from company,</p>

<p>I may revolve and ruminate my grief.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gloucester exits with Exeter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Thus Suffolk hath prevailed, and thus he goes</p>

<p>As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,</p>

<p>With hope to find the like event in love,</p>

<p>But prosper better than the Trojan did.</p>

<p>Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the King,</p>

<p>But I will rule both her, the King, and realm.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
