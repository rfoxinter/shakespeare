<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King, Gloucester, Winchester, Talbot,</p>

<p>Exeter; York and Warwick, with white roses; Suffolk</p>

<p>and Somerset, with red roses; Governor of Paris,</p>

<p>and Others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Lord Bishop, set the crown upon his head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Winchester</span> <i>[crowning King Henry]</i></p>

<p>God save King Henry, of that name the Sixth!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Now, Governor of Paris, take your oath.</p>

<p><center><i>[Governor kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>That you elect no other king but him;</p>

<p>Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,</p>

<p>And none your foes but such as shall pretend</p>

<p>Malicious practices against his state:</p>

<p>This shall you do, so help you righteous God.</p>

<p><center><i>[Governor rises.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fastolf.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fastolf</span></p>

<p>My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Callice</p>

<p>To haste unto your coronation,</p>

<p>A letter was delivered to my hands,</p>

<p>Writ to your Grace from th’ Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands the King a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!</p>

<p>I vowed, base knight, when I did meet thee next,</p>

<p>To tear the Garter from thy craven’s leg,</p>

<p><center><i>[tearing it off]</i></center></p>

<p>Which I have done, because unworthily</p>

<p>Thou wast installed in that high degree.–</p>

<p>Pardon me, princely Henry and the rest.</p>

<p>This dastard, at the battle of Patay,</p>

<p>When but in all I was six thousand strong</p>

<p>And that the French were almost ten to one,</p>

<p>Before we met or that a stroke was given,</p>

<p>Like to a trusty squire did run away;</p>

<p>In which assault we lost twelve hundred men.</p>

<p>Myself and divers gentlemen besides</p>

<p>Were there surprised and taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss,</p>

<p>Or whether that such cowards ought to wear</p>

<p>This ornament of knighthood–yea or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>To say the truth, this fact was infamous</p>

<p>And ill beseeming any common man,</p>

<p>Much more a knight, a captain, and a leader.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>When first this Order was ordained, my lords,</p>

<p>Knights of the Garter were of noble birth,</p>

<p>Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,</p>

<p>Such as were grown to credit by the wars;</p>

<p>Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress,</p>

<p>But always resolute in most extremes.</p>

<p>He then that is not furnished in this sort</p>

<p>Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,</p>

<p>Profaning this most honorable Order,</p>

<p>And should, if I were worthy to be judge,</p>

<p>Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain</p>

<p>That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[to Fastolf]</i></p>

<p>Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear’st thy doom.</p>

<p>Be packing therefore, thou that wast a knight.</p>

<p>Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death.</p>

<p><center><i>[Fastolf exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>And now, my lord protector, view the letter</p>

<p>Sent from our uncle, Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands the paper to Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>What means his Grace that he hath changed his style?</p>

<p>No more but, plain and bluntly, “To the King”!</p>

<p>Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?</p>

<p>Or doth this churlish superscription</p>

<p>Pretend some alteration in good will?</p>

<p>What’s here? <i>[(Reads.)]</i></p>

<p>I have upon especial cause,</p>

<p>Moved with compassion of my country’s wrack,</p>

<p>Together with the pitiful complaints</p>

<p>Of such as your oppression feeds upon,</p>

<p>Forsaken your pernicious faction</p>

<p>And joined with Charles, the rightful king of France.</p>

<p>O monstrous treachery! Can this be so?</p>

<p>That in alliance, amity, and oaths</p>

<p>There should be found such false dissembling guile?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>What? Doth my Uncle Burgundy revolt?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Is that the worst this letter doth contain?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him</p>

<p>And give him chastisement for this abuse.–</p>

<p>How say you, my lord, are you not content?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Content, my liege? Yes. But that I am prevented,</p>

<p>I should have begged I might have been employed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Then gather strength and march unto him straight;</p>

<p>Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason</p>

<p>And what offense it is to flout his friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>I go, my lord, in heart desiring still</p>

<p>You may behold confusion of your foes.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Vernon, with a white rose, and Basset,</p>

<p>with a red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Basset</span></p>

<p>And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span> <i>[indicating Vernon]</i></p>

<p>This is my servant; hear him, noble prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span> <i>[indicating Basset]</i></p>

<p>And this is mine, sweet Henry; favor him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak.–</p>

<p>Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim,</p>

<p>And wherefore crave you combat, or with whom?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>With him, my lord, for he hath done me wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Basset</span></p>

<p>And I with him, for he hath done me wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>What is that wrong whereof you both complain?</p>

<p>First let me know, and then I’ll answer you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Basset</span></p>

<p>Crossing the sea from England into France,</p>

<p>This fellow here with envious carping tongue</p>

<p>Upbraided me about the rose I wear,</p>

<p>Saying the sanguine color of the leaves</p>

<p>Did represent my master’s blushing cheeks</p>

<p>When stubbornly he did repugn the truth</p>

<p>About a certain question in the law</p>

<p>Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him,</p>

<p>With other vile and ignominious terms.</p>

<p>In confutation of which rude reproach,</p>

<p>And in defense of my lord’s worthiness,</p>

<p>I crave the benefit of law of arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>And that is my petition, noble lord;</p>

<p>For though he seem with forged quaint conceit</p>

<p>To set a gloss upon his bold intent,</p>

<p>Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him,</p>

<p>And he first took exceptions at this badge,</p>

<p>Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower</p>

<p>Bewrayed the faintness of my master’s heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,</p>

<p>Though ne’er so cunningly you smother it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men</p>

<p>When for so slight and frivolous a cause</p>

<p>Such factious emulations shall arise!</p>

<p>Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,</p>

<p>Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Let this dissension first be tried by fight,</p>

<p>And then your Highness shall command a peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;</p>

<p>Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span> <i>[throwing down a gage]</i></p>

<p>There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span> <i>[to Somerset]</i></p>

<p>Nay, let it rest where it began at first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Basset</span> <i>[to Somerset]</i></p>

<p>Confirm it so, mine honorable lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Confirm it so? Confounded be your strife,</p>

<p>And perish you with your audacious prate!</p>

<p>Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed</p>

<p>With this immodest clamorous outrage</p>

<p>To trouble and disturb the King and us?–</p>

<p>And you, my lords, methinks you do not well</p>

<p>To bear with their perverse objections,</p>

<p>Much less to take occasion from their mouths</p>

<p>To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves.</p>

<p>Let me persuade you take a better course.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>It grieves his Highness. Good my lords, be friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Come hither, you that would be combatants:</p>

<p>Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favor,</p>

<p>Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.–</p>

<p>And you, my lords, remember where we are:</p>

<p>In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation.</p>

<p>If they perceive dissension in our looks,</p>

<p>And that within ourselves we disagree,</p>

<p>How will their grudging stomachs be provoked</p>

<p>To willful disobedience and rebel!</p>

<p>Besides, what infamy will there arise</p>

<p>When foreign princes shall be certified</p>

<p>That for a toy, a thing of no regard,</p>

<p>King Henry’s peers and chief nobility</p>

<p>Destroyed themselves and lost the realm of France!</p>

<p>O, think upon the conquest of my father,</p>

<p>My tender years, and let us not forgo</p>

<p>That for a trifle that was bought with blood.</p>

<p>Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.</p>

<p>I see no reason if I wear this rose</p>

<p>That anyone should therefore be suspicious</p>

<p>I more incline to Somerset than York.</p>

<p><center><i>[He puts on a red rose.]</i></center></p>

<p>Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.</p>

<p>As well they may upbraid me with my crown</p>

<p>Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crowned.</p>

<p>But your discretions better can persuade</p>

<p>Than I am able to instruct or teach;</p>

<p>And therefore, as we hither came in peace,</p>

<p>So let us still continue peace and love.</p>

<p>Cousin of York, we institute your Grace</p>

<p>To be our regent in these parts of France;–</p>

<p>And good my Lord of Somerset, unite</p>

<p>Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;</p>

<p>And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,</p>

<p>Go cheerfully together and digest</p>

<p>Your angry choler on your enemies.</p>

<p>Ourself, my lord protector, and the rest,</p>

<p>After some respite, will return to Callice;</p>

<p>From thence to England, where I hope ere long</p>

<p>To be presented, by your victories,</p>

<p>With Charles, Alanson, and that traitorous rout.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. All but York, Warwick, Exeter, Vernon exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>My Lord of York, I promise you the King</p>

<p>Prettily, methought, did play the orator.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>And so he did, but yet I like it not</p>

<p>In that he wears the badge of Somerset.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Tush, that was but his fancy; blame him not.</p>

<p>I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>And if iwis he did–but let it rest.</p>

<p>Other affairs must now be managed.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[York, Warwick and Vernon exit.</p>

<p>Exeter remains.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice,</p>

<p>For had the passions of thy heart burst out,</p>

<p>I fear we should have seen deciphered there</p>

<p>More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,</p>

<p>Than yet can be imagined or supposed.</p>

<p>But howsoe’er, no simple man that sees</p>

<p>This jarring discord of nobility,</p>

<p>This shouldering of each other in the court,</p>

<p>This factious bandying of their favorites,</p>

<p>But sees it doth presage some ill event.</p>

<p>’Tis much when scepters are in children’s hands,</p>

<p>But more when envy breeds unkind division:</p>

<p>There comes the ruin; there begins confusion.</p>
