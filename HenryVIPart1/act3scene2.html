<p><center><i>[Enter Pucelle disguised, with four Soldiers with sacks</p>

<p>upon their backs.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>These are the city gates, the gates of Roan,</p>

<p>Through which our policy must make a breach.</p>

<p>Take heed. Be wary how you place your words;</p>

<p>Talk like the vulgar sort of market men</p>

<p>That come to gather money for their corn.</p>

<p>If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,</p>

<p>And that we find the slothful watch but weak,</p>

<p>I’ll by a sign give notice to our friends,</p>

<p>That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Soldier</sc></p>

<p>Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,</p>

<p>And we be lords and rulers over Roan;</p>

<p>Therefore we’ll knock.</p>

<p><center><i>[Knock.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Watch</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Qui la?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc>  Paysans la pauvre gens de France:</p>

<p>Poor market folks that come to sell their corn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Watch</sc></p>

<p>Enter, go in. The market bell is rung.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Now, Roan, I’ll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Charles, Bastard, Alanson, Reignier,</p>

<p>and Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Saint Dennis bless this happy stratagem</p>

<p>And once again we’ll sleep secure in Roan.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>Here entered Pucelle and her practisants.</p>

<p>Now she is there, how will she specify</p>

<p>“Here is the best and safest passage in”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc></p>

<p>By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower,</p>

<p>Which, once discerned, shows that her meaning is:</p>

<p>No way to that, for weakness, which she entered.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pucelle on the top, thrusting out a torch burning.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Behold, this is the happy wedding torch</p>

<p>That joineth Roan unto her countrymen,</p>

<p>But burning fatal to the Talbonites.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend;</p>

<p>The burning torch, in yonder turret stands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Now shine it like a comet of revenge,</p>

<p>A prophet to the fall of all our foes!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc></p>

<p>Defer no time; delays have dangerous ends.</p>

<p>Enter and cry “The Dauphin!” presently,</p>

<p>And then do execution on the watch.</p>

<p><center><i>[Alarum. They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[An Alarum. Enter Talbot in an excursion.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,</p>

<p>If Talbot but survive thy treachery.</p>

<p>Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,</p>

<p>Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,</p>

<p>That hardly we escaped the pride of France.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[An alarum. Excursions. Bedford brought in sick in</p>

<p>a chair, carried by two Attendants. Enter Talbot</p>

<p>and Burgundy without; within, Pucelle with a sack</p>

<p>of grain, Charles, Bastard, Alanson, and Reignier</p>

<p>on the walls.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc> <i>[to those below]</i></p>

<p>Good morrow, gallants. Want you corn for bread?</p>

<p><center><i>[She scatters grain on those below.]</i></center></p>

<p>I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast</p>

<p>Before he’ll buy again at such a rate.</p>

<p>’Twas full of darnel. Do you like the taste?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc></p>

<p>Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtesan!</p>

<p>I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own,</p>

<p>And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Your Grace may starve, perhaps, before that time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc></p>

<p>O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>What will you do, good graybeard? Break a lance</p>

<p>And run a-tilt at Death within a chair?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>Foul fiend of France and hag of all despite,</p>

<p>Encompassed with thy lustful paramours,</p>

<p>Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age</p>

<p>And twit with cowardice a man half dead?</p>

<p>Damsel, I’ll have a bout with you again,</p>

<p>Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Are you so hot, sir? Yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace,</p>

<p>If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow.</p>

<p><center><i>[Those below whisper together in council.]</i></center></p>

<p>God speed the Parliament! Who shall be the Speaker?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>Dare you come forth and meet us in the field?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Belike your Lordship takes us then for fools,</p>

<p>To try if that our own be ours or no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>I speak not to that railing Hecate,</p>

<p>But unto thee, Alanson, and the rest.</p>

<p>Will you, like soldiers, come and fight it out?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc>  Seigneur, no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>Seigneur, hang! Base muleteers of France,</p>

<p>Like peasant footboys do they keep the walls</p>

<p>And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Away, captains. Let’s get us from the walls,</p>

<p>For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.–</p>

<p>Goodbye, my lord. We came but to tell you</p>

<p>That we are here.     <i><i>[They exit from the walls.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>And there will we be too, ere it be long,</p>

<p>Or else reproach be Talbot’s greatest fame.–</p>

<p>Vow, Burgundy, by honor of thy house,</p>

<p>Pricked on by public wrongs sustained in France,</p>

<p>Either to get the town again or die.</p>

<p>And I, as sure as English Henry lives,</p>

<p>And as his father here was conqueror,</p>

<p>As sure as in this late-betrayed town</p>

<p>Great Coeur-de-lion’s heart was buried,</p>

<p>So sure I swear to get the town or die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc></p>

<p>My vows are equal partners with thy vows.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,</p>

<p>The valiant Duke of Bedford.–Come, my lord,</p>

<p>We will bestow you in some better place,</p>

<p>Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc></p>

<p>Lord Talbot, do not so dishonor me.</p>

<p>Here will I sit, before the walls of Roan,</p>

<p>And will be partner of your weal or woe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc></p>

<p>Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc></p>

<p>Not to be gone from hence, for once I read</p>

<p>That stout Pendragon, in his litter sick,</p>

<p>Came to the field and vanquished his foes.</p>

<p>Methinks I should revive the soldiers’ hearts</p>

<p>Because I ever found them as myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>Undaunted spirit in a dying breast,</p>

<p>Then be it so. Heavens keep old Bedford safe!–</p>

<p>And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,</p>

<p>But gather we our forces out of hand</p>

<p>And set upon our boasting enemy.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with Burgundy.</p>

<p>Bedford and Attendants remain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[An alarum. Excursions. Enter Sir John Fastolf</p>

<p>and a Captain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>Whither away, Sir John Fastolf, in such haste?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fastolf</sc></p>

<p>Whither away? To save myself by flight.</p>

<p>We are like to have the overthrow again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>What, will you fly and leave Lord Talbot?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fastolf</sc>  Ay,</p>

<p>All the Talbots in the world, to save my life.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>Cowardly knight, ill fortune follow thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Retreat. Excursions. Pucelle, Alanson, and Charles</p>

<p>enter, pursued by English Soldiers, and fly.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc></p>

<p>Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,</p>

<p>For I have seen our enemies’ overthrow.</p>

<p>What is the trust or strength of foolish man?</p>

<p>They that of late were daring with their scoffs</p>

<p>Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bedford dies, and is carried</p>

<p>in by two in his chair.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[An alarum. Enter Talbot, Burgundy, and the rest.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>Lost and recovered in a day again!</p>

<p>This is a double honor, Burgundy.</p>

<p>Yet heavens have glory for this victory.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc></p>

<p>Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy</p>

<p>Enshrines thee in his heart, and there erects</p>

<p>Thy noble deeds as valor’s monuments.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?</p>

<p>I think her old familiar is asleep.</p>

<p>Now where’s the Bastard’s braves and Charles his</p>

<p>gleeks?</p>

<p>What, all amort? Roan hangs her head for grief</p>

<p>That such a valiant company are fled.</p>

<p>Now will we take some order in the town,</p>

<p>Placing therein some expert officers,</p>

<p>And then depart to Paris to the King,</p>

<p>For there young Henry with his nobles lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc></p>

<p>What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>But yet, before we go, let’s not forget</p>

<p>The noble Duke of Bedford late-deceased,</p>

<p>But see his exequies fulfilled in Roan.</p>

<p>A braver soldier never couched lance,</p>

<p>A gentler heart did never sway in court.</p>

<p>But kings and mightiest potentates must die,</p>

<p>For that’s the end of human misery.</p>
