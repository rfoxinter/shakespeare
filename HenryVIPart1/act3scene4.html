<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>My gracious prince and honorable peers,</p>

<p>Hearing of your arrival in this realm,</p>

<p>I have awhile given truce unto my wars</p>

<p>To do my duty to my sovereign;</p>

<p>In sign whereof, this arm, that hath reclaimed</p>

<p>To your obedience fifty fortresses,</p>

<p>Twelve cities, and seven walled towns of strength,</p>

<p>Besides five hundred prisoners of esteem,</p>

<p>Lets fall his sword before your Highness’ feet,</p>

<p>And with submissive loyalty of heart</p>

<p>Ascribes the glory of his conquest got</p>

<p>First to my God, and next unto your Grace.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kneels.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Is this the Lord Talbot, Uncle Gloucester,</p>

<p>That hath so long been resident in France?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Yes, if it please your Majesty, my liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord.</p>

<p>When I was young–as yet I am not old–</p>

<p>I do remember how my father said</p>

<p>A stouter champion never handled sword.</p>

<p>Long since we were resolved of your truth,</p>

<p>Your faithful service, and your toil in war;</p>

<p>Yet never have you tasted our reward</p>

<p>Or been reguerdoned with so much as thanks,</p>

<p>Because till now we never saw your face.</p>

<p>Therefore stand up; and for these good deserts</p>

<p>We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;</p>

<p>And in our coronation take your place.     <i><i>[Talbot rises.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[Sennet. Flourish. All except</p>

<p>Vernon and Basset exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>Now, sir, to you that were so hot at sea,</p>

<p>Disgracing of these colors that I wear</p>

<p>In honor of my noble Lord of York,</p>

<p>Dar’st thou maintain the former words thou spak’st?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Basset</span></p>

<p>Yes, sir, as well as you dare patronage</p>

<p>The envious barking of your saucy tongue</p>

<p>Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>Sirrah, thy lord I honor as he is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Basset</span></p>

<p>Why, what is he? As good a man as York.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>Hark you, not so; in witness, take you that.</p>

<p><center><i>[Strikes him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Basset</span></p>

<p>Villain, thou knowest the law of arms is such</p>

<p>That whoso draws a sword ’tis present death,</p>

<p>Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.</p>

<p>But I’ll unto his Majesty, and crave</p>

<p>I may have liberty to venge this wrong,</p>

<p>When thou shalt see I’ll meet thee to thy cost.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>Well, miscreant, I’ll be there as soon as you,</p>

<p>And after meet you sooner than you would.</p>
