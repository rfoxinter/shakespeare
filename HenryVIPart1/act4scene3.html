<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger that meets York. Enter York</p>

<p>with Trumpet and many Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Are not the speedy scouts returned again</p>

<p>That dogged the mighty army of the Dauphin?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>They are returned, my lord, and give it out</p>

<p>That he is marched to Bordeaux with his power</p>

<p>To fight with Talbot. As he marched along,</p>

<p>By your espials were discovered</p>

<p>Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,</p>

<p>Which joined with him and made their march for</p>

<p>Bordeaux.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>A plague upon that villain Somerset</p>

<p>That thus delays my promised supply</p>

<p>Of horsemen that were levied for this siege!</p>

<p>Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,</p>

<p>And I am louted by a traitor villain</p>

<p>And cannot help the noble chevalier.</p>

<p>God comfort him in this necessity.</p>

<p>If he miscarry, farewell wars in France.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir William Lucy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucy</sc></p>

<p>Thou princely leader of our English strength,</p>

<p>Never so needful on the earth of France,</p>

<p>Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,</p>

<p>Who now is girdled with a waist of iron</p>

<p>And hemmed about with grim destruction.</p>

<p>To Bordeaux, warlike duke! To Bordeaux, York!</p>

<p>Else farewell Talbot, France, and England’s honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart</p>

<p>Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot’s place!</p>

<p>So should we save a valiant gentleman</p>

<p>By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.</p>

<p>Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep</p>

<p>That thus we die while remiss traitors sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucy</sc></p>

<p>O, send some succor to the distressed lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;</p>

<p>We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get,</p>

<p>All long of this vile traitor Somerset.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucy</sc></p>

<p>Then God take mercy on brave Talbot’s soul,</p>

<p>And on his son, young John, who two hours since</p>

<p>I met in travel toward his warlike father.</p>

<p>This seven years did not Talbot see his son,</p>

<p>And now they meet where both their lives are done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have</p>

<p>To bid his young son welcome to his grave?</p>

<p>Away! Vexation almost stops my breath,</p>

<p>That sundered friends greet in the hour of death.</p>

<p>Lucy, farewell. No more my fortune can</p>

<p>But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.</p>

<p>Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours are won away,</p>

<p>Long all of Somerset and his delay.</p>

<p><center><i>[York and his Soldiers exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucy</sc></p>

<p>Thus while the vulture of sedition</p>

<p>Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders,</p>

<p>Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss</p>

<p>The conquest of our scarce-cold conqueror,</p>

<p>That ever-living man of memory,</p>

<p>Henry the Fifth. Whiles they each other cross,</p>

<p>Lives, honors, lands, and all hurry to loss.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
