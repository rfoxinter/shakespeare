<p><center><i>[Enter Somerset with his army and a Captain</p>

<p>from Talbot’s army.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>It is too late; I cannot send them now.</p>

<p>This expedition was by York and Talbot</p>

<p>Too rashly plotted. All our general force</p>

<p>Might with a sally of the very town</p>

<p>Be buckled with. The overdaring Talbot</p>

<p>Hath sullied all his gloss of former honor</p>

<p>By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure.</p>

<p>York set him on to fight and die in shame</p>

<p>That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir William Lucy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Captain</span></p>

<p>Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me</p>

<p>Set from our o’er-matched forces forth for aid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>How now, Sir William, whither were you sent?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucy</span></p>

<p>Whither, my lord? From bought and sold Lord Talbot,</p>

<p>Who, ringed about with bold adversity,</p>

<p>Cries out for noble York and Somerset</p>

<p>To beat assailing Death from his weak regions;</p>

<p>And whiles the honorable captain there</p>

<p>Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs</p>

<p>And, in advantage ling’ring, looks for rescue,</p>

<p>You, his false hopes, the trust of England’s honor,</p>

<p>Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.</p>

<p>Let not your private discord keep away</p>

<p>The levied succors that should lend him aid,</p>

<p>While he, renowned noble gentleman,</p>

<p>Yield up his life unto a world of odds.</p>

<p>Orleance the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,</p>

<p>Alanson, Reignier compass him about,</p>

<p>And Talbot perisheth by your default.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>York set him on; York should have sent him aid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucy</span></p>

<p>And York as fast upon your Grace exclaims,</p>

<p>Swearing that you withhold his levied host</p>

<p>Collected for this expedition.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>York lies. He might have sent and had the horse.</p>

<p>I owe him little duty and less love,</p>

<p>And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucy</span></p>

<p>The fraud of England, not the force of France,</p>

<p>Hath now entrapped the noble-minded Talbot.</p>

<p>Never to England shall he bear his life,</p>

<p>But dies betrayed to fortune by your strife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Come, go. I will dispatch the horsemen straight.</p>

<p>Within six hours they will be at his aid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucy</span></p>

<p>Too late comes rescue; he is ta’en or slain,</p>

<p>For fly he could not if he would have fled;</p>

<p>And fly would Talbot never, though he might.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucy</span></p>

<p>His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.</p>
