<p><center><i>[Enter York, Warwick, Shepherd,</p>

<p>and Pucelle, guarded.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Bring forth that sorceress condemned to burn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc></p>

<p>Ah, Joan, this kills thy father’s heart outright.</p>

<p>Have I sought every country far and near,</p>

<p>And, now it is my chance to find thee out,</p>

<p>Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?</p>

<p>Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I’ll die with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Decrepit miser, base ignoble wretch!</p>

<p>I am descended of a gentler blood.</p>

<p>Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc></p>

<p>Out, out!–My lords, an please you, ’tis not so!</p>

<p>I did beget her, all the parish knows;</p>

<p>Her mother liveth yet, can testify</p>

<p>She was the first fruit of my bach’lorship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Graceless, wilt thou deny thy parentage?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>This argues what her kind of life hath been,</p>

<p>Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc></p>

<p>Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!</p>

<p>God knows thou art a collop of my flesh,</p>

<p>And for thy sake have I shed many a tear.</p>

<p>Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Peasant, avaunt!–You have suborned this man</p>

<p>Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shepherd</sc></p>

<p>’Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest</p>

<p>The morn that I was wedded to her mother.–</p>

<p>Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.</p>

<p>Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time</p>

<p>Of thy nativity! I would the milk</p>

<p>Thy mother gave thee when thou suck’dst her</p>

<p>breast</p>

<p>Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!</p>

<p>Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs afield,</p>

<p>I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!</p>

<p>Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?</p>

<p>O burn her, burn her! Hanging is too good.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Take her away, for she hath lived too long</p>

<p>To fill the world with vicious qualities.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>First, let me tell you whom you have condemned:</p>

<p>Not one begotten of a shepherd swain,</p>

<p>But issued from the progeny of kings,</p>

<p>Virtuous and holy, chosen from above</p>

<p>By inspiration of celestial grace</p>

<p>To work exceeding miracles on earth.</p>

<p>I never had to do with wicked spirits.</p>

<p>But you, that are polluted with your lusts,</p>

<p>Stained with the guiltless blood of innocents,</p>

<p>Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,</p>

<p>Because you want the grace that others have,</p>

<p>You judge it straight a thing impossible</p>

<p>To compass wonders but by help of devils.</p>

<p>No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been</p>

<p>A virgin from her tender infancy,</p>

<p>Chaste and immaculate in very thought,</p>

<p>Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,</p>

<p>Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Ay, ay.–Away with her to execution.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>And hark you, sirs: because she is a maid,</p>

<p>Spare for no faggots; let there be enow.</p>

<p>Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake</p>

<p>That so her torture may be shortened.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?</p>

<p>Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,</p>

<p>That warranteth by law to be thy privilege:</p>

<p>I am with child, you bloody homicides.</p>

<p>Murder not then the fruit within my womb,</p>

<p>Although you hale me to a violent death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Now heaven forfend, the holy maid with child?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc> <i>[to Pucelle]</i></p>

<p>The greatest miracle that e’er you wrought!</p>

<p>Is all your strict preciseness come to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>She and the Dauphin have been juggling.</p>

<p>I did imagine what would be her refuge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Well, go to, we’ll have no bastards live,</p>

<p>Especially since Charles must father it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>You are deceived; my child is none of his.</p>

<p>It was Alanson that enjoyed my love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Alanson, that notorious Machiavel?</p>

<p>It dies an if it had a thousand lives!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>O, give me leave! I have deluded you.</p>

<p>’Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I named,</p>

<p>But Reignier, King of Naples, that prevailed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>A married man? That’s most intolerable.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Why, here’s a girl! I think she knows not well–</p>

<p>There were so many–whom she may accuse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>It’s sign she hath been liberal and free.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure!–</p>

<p>Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee.</p>

<p>Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Then lead me hence, with whom I leave my curse:</p>

<p>May never glorious sun reflex his beams</p>

<p>Upon the country where you make abode,</p>

<p>But darkness and the gloomy shade of death</p>

<p>Environ you, till mischief and despair</p>

<p>Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits, led by Guards.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Break thou in pieces, and consume to ashes,</p>

<p>Thou foul accursed minister of hell!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Winchester, as Cardinal.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Winchester</sc></p>

<p>Lord Regent, I do greet your Excellence</p>

<p>With letters of commission from the King.</p>

<p>For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,</p>

<p>Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,</p>

<p>Have earnestly implored a general peace</p>

<p>Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;</p>

<p>And here at hand the Dauphin and his train</p>

<p>Approacheth to confer about some matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Is all our travail turned to this effect?</p>

<p>After the slaughter of so many peers,</p>

<p>So many captains, gentlemen, and soldiers</p>

<p>That in this quarrel have been overthrown</p>

<p>And sold their bodies for their country’s benefit,</p>

<p>Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?</p>

<p>Have we not lost most part of all the towns–</p>

<p>By treason, falsehood, and by treachery–</p>

<p>Our great progenitors had conquered?</p>

<p>O, Warwick, Warwick, I foresee with grief</p>

<p>The utter loss of all the realm of France!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Be patient, York; if we conclude a peace</p>

<p>It shall be with such strict and severe covenants</p>

<p>As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Charles, Alanson, Bastard,</p>

<p>Reignier, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed</p>

<p>That peaceful truce shall be proclaimed in France,</p>

<p>We come to be informed by yourselves</p>

<p>What the conditions of that league must be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Speak, Winchester, for boiling choler chokes</p>

<p>The hollow passage of my poisoned voice</p>

<p>By sight of these our baleful enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Winchester</sc></p>

<p>Charles and the rest, it is enacted thus:</p>

<p>That, in regard King Henry gives consent,</p>

<p>Of mere compassion and of lenity,</p>

<p>To ease your country of distressful war</p>

<p>And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,</p>

<p>You shall become true liegemen to his crown.</p>

<p>And, Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear</p>

<p>To pay him tribute and submit thyself,</p>

<p>Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,</p>

<p>And still enjoy thy regal dignity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc></p>

<p>Must he be then as shadow of himself–</p>

<p>Adorn his temples with a coronet,</p>

<p>And yet, in substance and authority,</p>

<p>Retain but privilege of a private man?</p>

<p>This proffer is absurd and reasonless.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>’Tis known already that I am possessed</p>

<p>With more than half the Gallian territories,</p>

<p>And therein reverenced for their lawful king.</p>

<p>Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquished,</p>

<p>Detract so much from that prerogative</p>

<p>As to be called but viceroy of the whole?</p>

<p>No, lord ambassador, I’ll rather keep</p>

<p>That which I have than, coveting for more,</p>

<p>Be cast from possibility of all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Insulting Charles, hast thou by secret means</p>

<p>Used intercession to obtain a league</p>

<p>And, now the matter grows to compromise,</p>

<p>Stand’st thou aloof upon comparison?</p>

<p>Either accept the title thou usurp’st,</p>

<p>Of benefit proceeding from our king</p>

<p>And not of any challenge of desert,</p>

<p>Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc> <i>[aside to Charles]</i></p>

<p>My lord, you do not well in obstinacy</p>

<p>To cavil in the course of this contract.</p>

<p>If once it be neglected, ten to one</p>

<p>We shall not find like opportunity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc> <i>[aside to Charles]</i></p>

<p>To say the truth, it is your policy</p>

<p>To save your subjects from such massacre</p>

<p>And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen</p>

<p>By our proceeding in hostility;</p>

<p>And therefore take this compact of a truce</p>

<p>Although you break it when your pleasure serves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>How say’st thou, Charles? Shall our condition stand?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>It shall–only reserved you claim no interest</p>

<p>In any of our towns of garrison.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Then swear allegiance to his Majesty,</p>

<p>As thou art knight, never to disobey</p>

<p>Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,</p>

<p>Thou nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.</p>

<p><center><i>[Charles, Alanson, Bastard, and Reignier</p>

<p>swear allegiance to Henry.]</i></center></p>

<p>So, now dismiss your army when you please;</p>

<p>Hang up your ensigns, let your drums be still,</p>

<p>For here we entertain a solemn peace.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
