<p><center><i>[Enter Richard Plantagenet, Warwick, Somerset,</p>

<p>William de la Pole the Earl of Suffolk,</p>

<p>Vernon, a Lawyer, and Others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?</p>

<p>Dare no man answer in a case of truth?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Within the Temple Hall we were too loud;</p>

<p>The garden here is more convenient.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Then say at once if I maintained the truth,</p>

<p>Or else was wrangling Somerset in th’ error?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Faith, I have been a truant in the law</p>

<p>And never yet could frame my will to it,</p>

<p>And therefore frame the law unto my will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch,</p>

<p>Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth,</p>

<p>Between two blades, which bears the better temper,</p>

<p>Between two horses, which doth bear him best,</p>

<p>Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye,</p>

<p>I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment;</p>

<p>But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,</p>

<p>Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance!</p>

<p>The truth appears so naked on my side</p>

<p>That any purblind eye may find it out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>And on my side it is so well appareled,</p>

<p>So clear, so shining, and so evident,</p>

<p>That it will glimmer through a blind man’s eye.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,</p>

<p>In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:</p>

<p>Let him that is a trueborn gentleman</p>

<p>And stands upon the honor of his birth,</p>

<p>If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,</p>

<p>From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,</p>

<p>But dare maintain the party of the truth,</p>

<p>Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>I love no colors; and, without all color</p>

<p>Of base insinuating flattery,</p>

<p>I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>I pluck this red rose with young Somerset,</p>

<p>And say withal I think he held the right.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more</p>

<p>Till you conclude that he upon whose side</p>

<p>The fewest roses are cropped from the tree</p>

<p>Shall yield the other in the right opinion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:</p>

<p>If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span>  And I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>Then for the truth and plainness of the case,</p>

<p>I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,</p>

<p>Giving my verdict on the white rose side.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,</p>

<p>Lest, bleeding, you do paint the white rose red,</p>

<p>And fall on my side so against your will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>If I, my lord, for my opinion bleed,</p>

<p>Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt</p>

<p>And keep me on the side where still I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span>  Well, well, come on, who else?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lawyer</span></p>

<p>Unless my study and my books be false,</p>

<p>The argument you held was wrong in law,</p>

<p>In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Now, Somerset, where is your argument?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Here in my scabbard, meditating that</p>

<p>Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses,</p>

<p>For pale they look with fear, as witnessing</p>

<p>The truth on our side.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span>  No, Plantagenet.</p>

<p>’Tis not for fear, but anger that thy cheeks</p>

<p>Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,</p>

<p>And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth,</p>

<p>Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Well, I’ll find friends to wear my bleeding roses</p>

<p>That shall maintain what I have said is true,</p>

<p>Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,</p>

<p>I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>I’ll turn my part thereof into thy throat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Away, away, good William de la Pole!</p>

<p>We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Now, by God’s will, thou wrong’st him, Somerset.</p>

<p>His grandfather was Lionel, Duke of Clarence,</p>

<p>Third son to the third Edward, King of England.</p>

<p>Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>He bears him on the place’s privilege,</p>

<p>Or durst not for his craven heart say thus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>By Him that made me, I’ll maintain my words</p>

<p>On any plot of ground in Christendom.</p>

<p>Was not thy father Richard, Earl of Cambridge,</p>

<p>For treason executed in our late king’s days?</p>

<p>And, by his treason, stand’st not thou attainted,</p>

<p>Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?</p>

<p>His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood,</p>

<p>And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>My father was attached, not attainted,</p>

<p>Condemned to die for treason, but no traitor;</p>

<p>And that I’ll prove on better men than Somerset,</p>

<p>Were growing time once ripened to my will.</p>

<p>For your partaker Pole and you yourself,</p>

<p>I’ll note you in my book of memory</p>

<p>To scourge you for this apprehension.</p>

<p>Look to it well, and say you are well warned.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still,</p>

<p>And know us by these colors for thy foes,</p>

<p>For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,</p>

<p>As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,</p>

<p>Will I forever, and my faction, wear</p>

<p>Until it wither with me to my grave</p>

<p>Or flourish to the height of my degree.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Go forward, and be choked with thy ambition!</p>

<p>And so farewell, until I meet thee next.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Have with thee, Pole.–Farewell, ambitious Richard.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>How I am braved, and must perforce endure it!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>This blot that they object against your house</p>

<p>Shall be whipped out in the next parliament,</p>

<p>Called for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;</p>

<p>And if thou be not then created York,</p>

<p>I will not live to be accounted Warwick.</p>

<p>Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,</p>

<p>Against proud Somerset and William Pole</p>

<p>Will I upon thy party wear this rose.</p>

<p>And here I prophesy: this brawl today,</p>

<p>Grown to this faction in the Temple garden,</p>

<p>Shall send, between the red rose and the white,</p>

<p>A thousand souls to death and deadly night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,</p>

<p>That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vernon</span></p>

<p>In your behalf still will I wear the same.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lawyer</span></p>

<p>And so will I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span>  Thanks, gentle sir.</p>

<p>Come, let us four to dinner. I dare say</p>

<p>This quarrel will drink blood another day.</p>
