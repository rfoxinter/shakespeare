<p><center><i>[Enter the Master Gunner of Orleance and his Boy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Master</span> <span class='sc'>Gunner</span></p>

<p>Sirrah, thou know’st how Orleance is besieged</p>

<p>And how the English have the suburbs won.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span></p>

<p>Father, I know, and oft have shot at them;</p>

<p>Howe’er, unfortunate, I missed my aim.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Master</span> <span class='sc'>Gunner</span></p>

<p>But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me.</p>

<p>Chief master-gunner am I of this town;</p>

<p>Something I must do to procure me grace.</p>

<p>The Prince’s espials have informed me</p>

<p>How the English, in the suburbs close entrenched,</p>

<p>Went through a secret grate of iron bars</p>

<p>In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,</p>

<p>And thence discover how with most advantage</p>

<p>They may vex us with shot or with assault.</p>

<p>To intercept this inconvenience,</p>

<p>A piece of ordnance ’gainst it I have placed,</p>

<p>And even these three days have I watched</p>

<p>If I could see them. Now do thou watch,</p>

<p>For I can stay no longer.</p>

<p>If thou spy’st any, run and bring me word;</p>

<p>And thou shalt find me at the Governor’s.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span></p>

<p>Father, I warrant you, take you no care;</p>

<p>I’ll never trouble you if I may spy them.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Salisbury and Talbot on the turrets,</p>

<p>with Sir William Glansdale, Sir Thomas Gargrave,</p>

<p>Attendants and Others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Talbot, my life, my joy, again returned!</p>

<p>How wert thou handled, being prisoner?</p>

<p>Or by what means gott’st thou to be released?</p>

<p>Discourse, I prithee, on this turret’s top.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner</p>

<p>Called the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;</p>

<p>For him was I exchanged and ransomed.</p>

<p>But with a baser man-of-arms by far</p>

<p>Once in contempt they would have bartered me,</p>

<p>Which I disdaining, scorned, and craved death</p>

<p>Rather than I would be so vile-esteemed.</p>

<p>In fine, redeemed I was as I desired.</p>

<p>But O, the treacherous Fastolf wounds my heart,</p>

<p>Whom with my bare fists I would execute</p>

<p>If I now had him brought into my power.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Yet tell’st thou not how thou wert entertained.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.</p>

<p>In open marketplace produced they me</p>

<p>To be a public spectacle to all.</p>

<p>“Here,” said they, “is the terror of the French,</p>

<p>The scarecrow that affrights our children so.”</p>

<p>Then broke I from the officers that led me,</p>

<p>And with my nails digged stones out of the ground</p>

<p>To hurl at the beholders of my shame.</p>

<p>My grisly countenance made others fly;</p>

<p>None durst come near for fear of sudden death.</p>

<p>In iron walls they deemed me not secure:</p>

<p>So great fear of my name ’mongst them were spread</p>

<p>That they supposed I could rend bars of steel</p>

<p>And spurn in pieces posts of adamant.</p>

<p>Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had</p>

<p>That walked about me every minute-while;</p>

<p>And if I did but stir out of my bed,</p>

<p>Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Boy with a linstock.</p>

<p>He crosses the main stage and exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>I grieve to hear what torments you endured,</p>

<p>But we will be revenged sufficiently.</p>

<p>Now it is supper time in Orleance.</p>

<p>Here, through this grate, I count each one</p>

<p>And view the Frenchmen how they fortify.</p>

<p>Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir William Glansdale,</p>

<p>Let me have your express opinions</p>

<p>Where is best place to make our batt’ry next?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gargrave</span></p>

<p>I think at the north gate, for there stands lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Glansdale</span></p>

<p>And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>For aught I see, this city must be famished</p>

<p>Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here they shoot, and Salisbury</p>

<p>and Gargrave fall down.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gargrave</span></p>

<p>O Lord, have mercy on me, woeful man!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>What chance is this that suddenly hath crossed us?–</p>

<p>Speak, Salisbury–at least if thou canst, speak!</p>

<p>How far’st thou, mirror of all martial men?</p>

<p>One of thy eyes and thy cheek’s side struck off!–</p>

<p>Accursed tower, accursed fatal hand</p>

<p>That hath contrived this woeful tragedy!</p>

<p>In thirteen battles Salisbury o’ercame;</p>

<p>Henry the Fifth he first trained to the wars.</p>

<p>Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,</p>

<p>His sword did ne’er leave striking in the field.–</p>

<p>Yet liv’st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,</p>

<p>One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace.</p>

<p>The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.</p>

<p>Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive</p>

<p>If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!–</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?</p>

<p>Speak unto Talbot. Nay, look up to him.–</p>

<p>Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.</p>

<p><center><i>[Attendants exit with body of Gargrave.]</i></center></p>

<p>Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,</p>

<p>Thou shalt not die whiles–</p>

<p>He beckons with his hand and smiles on me</p>

<p>As who should say “When I am dead and gone,</p>

<p>Remember to avenge me on the French.”</p>

<p>Plantagenet, I will; and, like thee, Nero,</p>

<p>Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.</p>

<p>Wretched shall France be only in my name.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens.]</i></center></p>

<p>What stir is this? What tumult’s in the heavens?</p>

<p>Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head.</p>

<p>The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle joined,</p>

<p>A holy prophetess new risen up,</p>

<p>Is come with a great power to raise the siege.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here Salisbury lifteth himself up and groans.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Hear, hear, how dying Salisbury doth groan;</p>

<p>It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.</p>

<p>Frenchmen, I’ll be a Salisbury to you.</p>

<p>Pucelle or puzel, dauphin or dogfish,</p>

<p>Your hearts I’ll stamp out with my horse’s heels</p>

<p>And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.</p>

<p>Convey we Salisbury into his tent,</p>

<p>And then try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.</p>

<p><center><i>[Alarum. They exit.]</i></center></p>
