<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King Henry, Exeter, Gloucester, and</p>

<p>Winchester; Richard Plantagenet and Warwick,</p>

<p>with white roses; Somerset and Suffolk, with red</p>

<p>roses; and Others. Gloucester offers to put up a bill.</p>

<p>Winchester snatches it, tears it.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Winchester</sc></p>

<p>Com’st thou with deep premeditated lines,</p>

<p>With written pamphlets studiously devised?</p>

<p>Humphrey of Gloucester, if thou canst accuse</p>

<p>Or aught intend’st to lay unto my charge,</p>

<p>Do it without invention, suddenly,</p>

<p>As I with sudden and extemporal speech</p>

<p>Purpose to answer what thou canst object.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Presumptuous priest, this place commands my</p>

<p>patience,</p>

<p>Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonored me.</p>

<p>Think not, although in writing I preferred</p>

<p>The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,</p>

<p>That therefore I have forged or am not able</p>

<p>Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen.</p>

<p>No, prelate, such is thy audacious wickedness,</p>

<p>Thy lewd, pestiferous, and dissentious pranks,</p>

<p>As very infants prattle of thy pride.</p>

<p>Thou art a most pernicious usurer,</p>

<p>Froward by nature, enemy to peace,</p>

<p>Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems</p>

<p>A man of thy profession and degree.</p>

<p>And for thy treachery, what’s more manifest,</p>

<p>In that thou laid’st a trap to take my life</p>

<p>As well at London Bridge as at the Tower?</p>

<p>Besides, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,</p>

<p>The King, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt</p>

<p>From envious malice of thy swelling heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Winchester</sc></p>

<p>Gloucester, I do defy thee.–Lords, vouchsafe</p>

<p>To give me hearing what I shall reply.</p>

<p>If I were covetous, ambitious, or perverse,</p>

<p>As he will have me, how am I so poor?</p>

<p>Or how haps it I seek not to advance</p>

<p>Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?</p>

<p>And for dissension, who preferreth peace</p>

<p>More than I do, except I be provoked?</p>

<p>No, my good lords, it is not that offends;</p>

<p>It is not that that hath incensed the Duke.</p>

<p>It is because no one should sway but he,</p>

<p>No one but he should be about the King;</p>

<p>And that engenders thunder in his breast</p>

<p>And makes him roar these accusations forth.</p>

<p>But he shall know I am as good–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  As good!</p>

<p>Thou bastard of my grandfather!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Winchester</sc></p>

<p>Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,</p>

<p>But one imperious in another’s throne?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Am I not Protector, saucy priest?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Winchester</sc></p>

<p>And am not I a prelate of the Church?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps,</p>

<p>And useth it to patronage his theft.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Winchester</sc></p>

<p>Unreverent Gloucester!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Thou art reverend</p>

<p>Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Winchester</sc></p>

<p>Rome shall remedy this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Roam thither then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc> <i>[to Winchester]</i></p>

<p>My lord, it were your duty to forbear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Somerset</sc></p>

<p>Ay, so the Bishop be not overborne.</p>

<p>Methinks my lord should be religious,</p>

<p>And know the office that belongs to such.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Methinks his Lordship should be humbler.</p>

<p>It fitteth not a prelate so to plead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Somerset</sc></p>

<p>Yes, when his holy state is touched so near.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>State holy, or unhallowed, what of that?</p>

<p>Is not his Grace Protector to the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plantagenet</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,</p>

<p>Lest it be said “Speak, sirrah, when you should;</p>

<p>Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?”</p>

<p>Else would I have a fling at Winchester.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,</p>

<p>The special watchmen of our English weal,</p>

<p>I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,</p>

<p>To join your hearts in love and amity.</p>

<p>O, what a scandal is it to our crown</p>

<p>That two such noble peers as you should jar!</p>

<p>Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell</p>

<p>Civil dissension is a viperous worm</p>

<p>That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[A noise within: “Down with the tawny coats!”]</i></center></p>

<p>What tumult ’s this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc>  An uproar, I dare warrant,</p>

<p>Begun through malice of the Bishop’s men.</p>

<p><center><i>[A noise again: “Stones! Stones!”]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mayor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mayor</sc></p>

<p>O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,</p>

<p>Pity the city of London, pity us!</p>

<p>The Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester’s men,</p>

<p>Forbidden late to carry any weapon,</p>

<p>Have filled their pockets full of pebble stones</p>

<p>And, banding themselves in contrary parts,</p>

<p>Do pelt so fast at one another’s pate</p>

<p>That many have their giddy brains knocked out;</p>

<p>Our windows are broke down in every street,</p>

<p>And we, for fear, compelled to shut our shops.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servingmen in skirmish with bloody pates.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,</p>

<p>To hold your slaught’ring hands and keep the peace.–</p>

<p>Pray, Uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc>  Nay, if we be forbidden stones, we’ll</p>

<p>fall to it with our teeth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>Do what you dare, we are as</p>

<p>resolute.     <i><i>[Skirmish again.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>You of my household, leave this peevish broil,</p>

<p>And set this unaccustomed fight aside.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>My lord, we know your Grace to be a man</p>

<p>Just and upright, and, for your royal birth,</p>

<p>Inferior to none but to his Majesty;</p>

<p>And ere that we will suffer such a prince,</p>

<p>So kind a father of the commonweal,</p>

<p>To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,</p>

<p>We and our wives and children all will fight</p>

<p>And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc></p>

<p>Ay, and the very parings of our nails</p>

<p>Shall pitch a field when we are dead.</p>

<p><center><i>[Begin again.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Stay, stay, I say!</p>

<p>And if you love me, as you say you do,</p>

<p>Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!</p>

<p>Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold</p>

<p>My sighs and tears, and will not once relent?</p>

<p>Who should be pitiful if you be not?</p>

<p>Or who should study to prefer a peace</p>

<p>If holy churchmen take delight in broils?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Yield, my Lord Protector–yield, Winchester–</p>

<p>Except you mean with obstinate repulse</p>

<p>To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.</p>

<p>You see what mischief, and what murder too,</p>

<p>Hath been enacted through your enmity.</p>

<p>Then be at peace, except you thirst for blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Winchester</sc></p>

<p>He shall submit, or I will never yield.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Compassion on the King commands me stoop,</p>

<p>Or I would see his heart out ere the priest</p>

<p>Should ever get that privilege of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the Duke</p>

<p>Hath banished moody discontented fury,</p>

<p>As by his smoothed brows it doth appear.</p>

<p>Why look you still so stern and tragical?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.</p>

<p><center><i>[Winchester refuses Gloucester’s hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Fie, Uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach</p>

<p>That malice was a great and grievous sin;</p>

<p>And will not you maintain the thing you teach,</p>

<p>But prove a chief offender in the same?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Sweet king! The Bishop hath a kindly gird.–</p>

<p>For shame, my Lord of Winchester, relent;</p>

<p>What, shall a child instruct you what to do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Winchester</sc></p>

<p>Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;</p>

<p>Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.</p>

<p><center><i>[They take each other’s hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Ay, but I fear me with a hollow heart.–</p>

<p>See here, my friends and loving countrymen,</p>

<p>This token serveth for a flag of truce</p>

<p>Betwixt ourselves and all our followers,</p>

<p>So help me God, as I dissemble not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Winchester</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>So help me God, as I intend it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>O, loving uncle–kind Duke of Gloucester–</p>

<p>How joyful am I made by this contract.</p>

<p><i>[To the Servingmen.]</i> Away, my masters, trouble us</p>

<p>no more,</p>

<p>But join in friendship as your lords have done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc>  Content. I’ll to the surgeon’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc>  And so will I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Servingman</sc>  And I will see what physic the tavern</p>

<p>affords.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit with Mayor and Others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc> <i>[presenting a scroll]</i></p>

<p>Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,</p>

<p>Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet</p>

<p>We do exhibit to your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Well urged, my Lord of Warwick.–For, sweet prince,</p>

<p>An if your Grace mark every circumstance,</p>

<p>You have great reason to do Richard right,</p>

<p>Especially for those occasions</p>

<p>At Eltham Place I told your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>And those occasions, uncle, were of force.–</p>

<p>Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is</p>

<p>That Richard be restored to his blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Let Richard be restored to his blood;</p>

<p>So shall his father’s wrongs be recompensed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Winchester</sc></p>

<p>As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>If Richard will be true, not that alone</p>

<p>But all the whole inheritance I give</p>

<p>That doth belong unto the house of York,</p>

<p>From whence you spring by lineal descent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plantagenet</sc></p>

<p>Thy humble servant vows obedience</p>

<p>And humble service till the point of death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Stoop then, and set your knee against my foot;</p>

<p><center><i>[Plantagenet kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>And in reguerdon of that duty done</p>

<p>I girt thee with the valiant sword of York.</p>

<p>Rise, Richard, like a true Plantagenet,</p>

<p>And rise created princely Duke of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc> <i>[formerly <sc>Plantagenet</sc> standing]</i></p>

<p>And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!</p>

<p>And as my duty springs, so perish they</p>

<p>That grudge one thought against your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc></p>

<p>Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Somerset</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Now will it best avail your Majesty</p>

<p>To cross the seas and to be crowned in France.</p>

<p>The presence of a king engenders love</p>

<p>Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,</p>

<p>As it disanimates his enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes,</p>

<p>For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Your ships already are in readiness.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sennet. Flourish. All but Exeter exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Exeter</sc></p>

<p>Ay, we may march in England or in France,</p>

<p>Not seeing what is likely to ensue.</p>

<p>This late dissension grown betwixt the peers</p>

<p>Burns under feigned ashes of forged love</p>

<p>And will at last break out into a flame.</p>

<p>As festered members rot but by degree</p>

<p>Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,</p>

<p>So will this base and envious discord breed.</p>

<p>And now I fear that fatal prophecy</p>

<p>Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth</p>

<p>Was in the mouth of every sucking babe:</p>

<p>That Henry born at Monmouth should win all,</p>

<p>And Henry born at Windsor should lose all,</p>

<p>Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish</p>

<p>His days may finish ere that hapless time.</p>
