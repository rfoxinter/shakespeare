<p><center><i>[Enter Edmund Mortimer, brought in a chair,</p>

<p>and Jailers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,</p>

<p>Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.</p>

<p>Even like a man new-haled from the rack,</p>

<p>So fare my limbs with long imprisonment;</p>

<p>And these gray locks, the pursuivants of death,</p>

<p>Nestor-like aged in an age of care,</p>

<p>Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer;</p>

<p>These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,</p>

<p>Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;</p>

<p>Weak shoulders, overborne with burdening grief,</p>

<p>And pithless arms, like to a withered vine</p>

<p>That droops his sapless branches to the ground;</p>

<p>Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,</p>

<p>Unable to support this lump of clay,</p>

<p>Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,</p>

<p>As witting I no other comfort have.</p>

<p>But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span></p>

<p>Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come.</p>

<p>We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber,</p>

<p>And answer was returned that he will come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>Enough. My soul shall then be satisfied.</p>

<p>Poor gentleman, his wrong doth equal mine.</p>

<p>Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,</p>

<p>Before whose glory I was great in arms,</p>

<p>This loathsome sequestration have I had;</p>

<p>And even since then hath Richard been obscured,</p>

<p>Deprived of honor and inheritance.</p>

<p>But now the arbitrator of despairs,</p>

<p>Just Death, kind umpire of men’s miseries,</p>

<p>With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence.</p>

<p>I would his troubles likewise were expired,</p>

<p>That so he might recover what was lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Richard Plantagenet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Keeper</span></p>

<p>My lord, your loving nephew now is come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,</p>

<p>Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span> <i>[to Jailer]</i></p>

<p>Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck</p>

<p>And in his bosom spend my latter gasp.</p>

<p>O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,</p>

<p>That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.</p>

<p><center><i>[He embraces Richard.]</i></center></p>

<p>And now declare, sweet stem from York’s great stock,</p>

<p>Why didst thou say of late thou wert despised?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>First, lean thine aged back against mine arm,</p>

<p>And in that ease I’ll tell thee my disease.</p>

<p>This day, in argument upon a case,</p>

<p>Some words there grew ’twixt Somerset and me,</p>

<p>Among which terms he used his lavish tongue</p>

<p>And did upbraid me with my father’s death;</p>

<p>Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,</p>

<p>Else with the like I had requited him.</p>

<p>Therefore, good uncle, for my father’s sake,</p>

<p>In honor of a true Plantagenet,</p>

<p>And for alliance’ sake, declare the cause</p>

<p>My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>That cause, fair nephew, that imprisoned me</p>

<p>And hath detained me all my flow’ring youth</p>

<p>Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,</p>

<p>Was cursed instrument of his decease.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Discover more at large what cause that was,</p>

<p>For I am ignorant and cannot guess.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>I will, if that my fading breath permit</p>

<p>And death approach not ere my tale be done.</p>

<p>Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,</p>

<p>Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward’s son,</p>

<p>The first begotten and the lawful heir</p>

<p>Of Edward king, the third of that descent;</p>

<p>During whose reign the Percies of the north,</p>

<p>Finding his usurpation most unjust,</p>

<p>Endeavored my advancement to the throne.</p>

<p>The reason moved these warlike lords to this</p>

<p>Was, for that–young Richard thus removed,</p>

<p>Leaving no heir begotten of his body–</p>

<p>I was the next by birth and parentage;</p>

<p>For by my mother I derived am</p>

<p>From Lionel, Duke of Clarence, third son</p>

<p>To King Edward the Third; whereas he</p>

<p>From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,</p>

<p>Being but fourth of that heroic line.</p>

<p>But mark: as in this haughty great attempt</p>

<p>They labored to plant the rightful heir,</p>

<p>I lost my liberty and they their lives.</p>

<p>Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,</p>

<p>Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,</p>

<p>Thy father, Earl of Cambridge then, derived</p>

<p>From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,</p>

<p>Marrying my sister that thy mother was,</p>

<p>Again, in pity of my hard distress,</p>

<p>Levied an army, weening to redeem</p>

<p>And have installed me in the diadem.</p>

<p>But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl</p>

<p>And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,</p>

<p>In whom the title rested, were suppressed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Of which, my lord, your Honor is the last.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>True, and thou seest that I no issue have</p>

<p>And that my fainting words do warrant death.</p>

<p>Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather.</p>

<p>But yet be wary in thy studious care.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.</p>

<p>But yet methinks my father’s execution</p>

<p>Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>With silence, nephew, be thou politic;</p>

<p>Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,</p>

<p>And, like a mountain, not to be removed.</p>

<p>But now thy uncle is removing hence,</p>

<p>As princes do their courts when they are cloyed</p>

<p>With long continuance in a settled place.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>O uncle, would some part of my young years</p>

<p>Might but redeem the passage of your age.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mortimer</span></p>

<p>Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth</p>

<p>Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.</p>

<p>Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;</p>

<p>Only give order for my funeral.</p>

<p>And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes,</p>

<p>And prosperous be thy life in peace and war.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Plantagenet</span></p>

<p>And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul.</p>

<p>In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage,</p>

<p>And like a hermit overpassed thy days.–</p>

<p>Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast,</p>

<p>And what I do imagine, let that rest.–</p>

<p>Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself</p>

<p>Will see his burial better than his life.</p>

<p><center><i>[Jailers exit carrying Mortimer’s body.]</i></center></p>

<p>Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,</p>

<p>Choked with ambition of the meaner sort.</p>

<p>And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,</p>

<p>Which Somerset hath offered to my house,</p>

<p>I doubt not but with honor to redress.</p>

<p>And therefore haste I to the Parliament,</p>

<p>Either to be restored to my blood,</p>

<p>Or make mine ill th’ advantage of my good.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
