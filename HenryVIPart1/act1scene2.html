<p><center><i>[Sound a flourish. Enter Charles the Dauphin,</p>

<p>Alanson, and Reignier, marching with Drum</p>

<p>and Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens</p>

<p>So in the Earth, to this day is not known.</p>

<p>Late did he shine upon the English side;</p>

<p>Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.</p>

<p>What towns of any moment but we have?</p>

<p>At pleasure here we lie, near Orleance.</p>

<p>Otherwhiles, the famished English, like pale ghosts,</p>

<p>Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc></p>

<p>They want their porridge and their fat bull beeves.</p>

<p>Either they must be dieted like mules</p>

<p>And have their provender tied to their mouths,</p>

<p>Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc></p>

<p>Let’s raise the siege. Why live we idly here?</p>

<p>Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear.</p>

<p>Remaineth none but mad-brained Salisbury,</p>

<p>And he may well in fretting spend his gall;</p>

<p>Nor men nor money hath he to make war.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Sound, sound alarum! We will rush on them.</p>

<p>Now for the honor of the forlorn French!</p>

<p>Him I forgive my death that killeth me</p>

<p>When he sees me go back one foot, or fly.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit. Here alarum. They are beaten</p>

<p>back by the English, with great loss.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Charles, Alanson, and Reignier.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Whoever saw the like? What men have I!</p>

<p>Dogs, cowards, dastards! I would ne’er have fled</p>

<p>But that they left me ’midst my enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc></p>

<p>Salisbury is a desperate homicide.</p>

<p>He fighteth as one weary of his life.</p>

<p>The other lords, like lions wanting food,</p>

<p>Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc></p>

<p>Froissart, a countryman of ours, records</p>

<p>England all Olivers and Rolands bred</p>

<p>During the time Edward the Third did reign.</p>

<p>More truly now may this be verified,</p>

<p>For none but Samsons and Goliases</p>

<p>It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!</p>

<p>Lean rawboned rascals! Who would e’er suppose</p>

<p>They had such courage and audacity?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Let’s leave this town, for they are hare-brained slaves,</p>

<p>And hunger will enforce them to be more eager.</p>

<p>Of old I know them; rather with their teeth</p>

<p>The walls they’ll tear down than forsake the siege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc></p>

<p>I think by some odd gimmers or device</p>

<p>Their arms are set, like clocks, still to strike on;</p>

<p>Else ne’er could they hold out so as they do.</p>

<p>By my consent, we’ll even let them alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc>  Be it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Bastard of Orleance.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>Where’s the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Bastard of Orleance, thrice welcome to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appalled.</p>

<p>Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?</p>

<p>Be not dismayed, for succor is at hand.</p>

<p>A holy maid hither with me I bring,</p>

<p>Which, by a vision sent to her from heaven,</p>

<p>Ordained is to raise this tedious siege</p>

<p>And drive the English forth the bounds of France.</p>

<p>The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,</p>

<p>Exceeding the nine Sibyls of old Rome.</p>

<p>What’s past and what’s to come she can descry.</p>

<p>Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,</p>

<p>For they are certain and unfallible.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Go call her in.     <i><i>[Bastard exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>But first, to try her skill,</p>

<p>Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place;</p>

<p>Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern.</p>

<p>By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bastard, with Joan la Pucelle.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc> <i>[as Charles]</i></p>

<p>Fair maid, is ’t thou wilt do these wondrous feats?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Reignier, is ’t thou that thinkest to beguile me?</p>

<p>Where is the Dauphin?–Come, come from behind.</p>

<p>I know thee well, though never seen before.</p>

<p>Be not amazed; there’s nothing hid from me.</p>

<p>In private will I talk with thee apart.–</p>

<p>Stand back, you lords, and give us leave a while.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc></p>

<p>She takes upon her bravely at first dash.</p>

<p><center><i>[Alanson, Reignier, and Bastard exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd’s daughter,</p>

<p>My wit untrained in any kind of art.</p>

<p>Heaven and Our Lady gracious hath it pleased</p>

<p>To shine on my contemptible estate.</p>

<p>Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,</p>

<p>And to sun’s parching heat displayed my cheeks,</p>

<p>God’s Mother deigned to appear to me,</p>

<p>And in a vision full of majesty</p>

<p>Willed me to leave my base vocation</p>

<p>And free my country from calamity.</p>

<p>Her aid she promised and assured success.</p>

<p>In complete glory she revealed herself;</p>

<p>And whereas I was black and swart before,</p>

<p>With those clear rays which she infused on me</p>

<p>That beauty am I blest with, which you may see.</p>

<p>Ask me what question thou canst possible,</p>

<p>And I will answer unpremeditated.</p>

<p>My courage try by combat, if thou dar’st,</p>

<p>And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.</p>

<p>Resolve on this: thou shalt be fortunate</p>

<p>If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Thou hast astonished me with thy high terms.</p>

<p>Only this proof I’ll of thy valor make:</p>

<p>In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,</p>

<p>And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;</p>

<p>Otherwise I renounce all confidence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>I am prepared. Here is my keen-edged sword,</p>

<p>Decked with fine flower-de-luces on each side–</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> The which at Touraine, in Saint Katherine’s</p>

<p>churchyard,</p>

<p>Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Then come, a’ God’s name! I fear no woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>And while I live, I’ll ne’er fly from a man.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here they fight, and</p>

<p>Joan la Pucelle overcomes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Stay, stay thy hands! Thou art an Amazon,</p>

<p>And fightest with the sword of Deborah.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Christ’s mother helps me; else I were too weak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Whoe’er helps thee, ’tis thou that must help me.</p>

<p>Impatiently I burn with thy desire.</p>

<p>My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.</p>

<p>Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,</p>

<p>Let me thy servant and not sovereign be.</p>

<p>’Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>I must not yield to any rights of love,</p>

<p>For my profession’s sacred from above.</p>

<p>When I have chased all thy foes from hence,</p>

<p>Then will I think upon a recompense.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Reignier and Alanson.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc> <i>[aside to Alanson]</i></p>

<p>My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc> <i>[aside to Reignier]</i></p>

<p>Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock,</p>

<p>Else ne’er could he so long protract his speech.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc> <i>[aside to Alanson]</i></p>

<p>Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc> <i>[aside to Reignier]</i></p>

<p>He may mean more than we poor men do know.</p>

<p>These women are shrewd tempters with their</p>

<p>tongues.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc> <i>[to Charles]</i></p>

<p>My lord, where are you? What devise you on?</p>

<p>Shall we give o’er Orleance, or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Why, no, I say. Distrustful recreants,</p>

<p>Fight till the last gasp. I’ll be your guard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>What she says I’ll confirm: we’ll fight it out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Assigned am I to be the English scourge.</p>

<p>This night the siege assuredly I’ll raise.</p>

<p>Expect Saint Martin’s summer, halcyons’ days,</p>

<p>Since I have entered into these wars.</p>

<p>Glory is like a circle in the water,</p>

<p>Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself</p>

<p>Till by broad spreading it disperse to naught.</p>

<p>With Henry’s death, the English circle ends;</p>

<p>Dispersed are the glories it included.</p>

<p>Now am I like that proud insulting ship</p>

<p>Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?</p>

<p>Thou with an eagle art inspired then.</p>

<p>Helen, the mother of great Constantine,</p>

<p>Nor yet Saint Philip’s daughters were like thee.</p>

<p>Bright star of Venus, fall’n down on the Earth,</p>

<p>How may I reverently worship thee enough?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc></p>

<p>Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc></p>

<p>Woman, do what thou canst to save our honors.</p>

<p>Drive them from Orleance and be immortalized.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Presently we’ll try. Come, let’s away about it.</p>

<p>No prophet will I trust if she prove false.</p>
