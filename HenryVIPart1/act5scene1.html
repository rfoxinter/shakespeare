<p><center><i>[Sennet. Enter King, Gloucester, and Exeter,</p>

<p>with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>Have you perused the letters from the Pope,</p>

<p>The Emperor, and the Earl of Armagnac?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>I have, my lord, and their intent is this:</p>

<p>They humbly sue unto your Excellence</p>

<p>To have a godly peace concluded of</p>

<p>Between the realms of England and of France.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>How doth your Grace affect their motion?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Well, my good lord, and as the only means</p>

<p>To stop effusion of our Christian blood</p>

<p>And stablish quietness on every side.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Ay, marry, uncle, for I always thought</p>

<p>It was both impious and unnatural</p>

<p>That such immanity and bloody strife</p>

<p>Should reign among professors of one faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Besides, my lord, the sooner to effect</p>

<p>And surer bind this knot of amity,</p>

<p>The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles,</p>

<p>A man of great authority in France,</p>

<p>Proffers his only daughter to your Grace</p>

<p>In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Marriage, uncle? Alas, my years are young;</p>

<p>And fitter is my study and my books</p>

<p>Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.</p>

<p>Yet call th’ Ambassadors and, as you please,</p>

<p>So let them have their answers every one.</p>

<p><center><i>[An Attendant exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>I shall be well content with any choice</p>

<p>Tends to God’s glory and my country’s weal.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Winchester, dressed in cardinal’s robes,</p>

<p>and the Ambassador of Armagnac, a Papal Legate,</p>

<p>and another Ambassador.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>What, is my Lord of Winchester installed</p>

<p>And called unto a cardinal’s degree?</p>

<p>Then I perceive that will be verified</p>

<p>Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy:</p>

<p>“If once he come to be a cardinal,</p>

<p>He’ll make his cap coequal with the crown.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>My Lords Ambassadors, your several suits</p>

<p>Have been considered and debated on;</p>

<p>Your purpose is both good and reasonable,</p>

<p>And therefore are we certainly resolved</p>

<p>To draw conditions of a friendly peace,</p>

<p>Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean</p>

<p>Shall be transported presently to France.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span> <i>[to the Ambassador of Armagnac]</i></p>

<p>And for the proffer of my lord your master,</p>

<p>I have informed his Highness so at large</p>

<p>As, liking of the lady’s virtuous gifts,</p>

<p>Her beauty, and the value of her dower,</p>

<p>He doth intend she shall be England’s queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[handing a jewel to the Ambassador]</i></p>

<p>In argument and proof of which contract,</p>

<p>Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.–</p>

<p>And so, my Lord Protector, see them guarded</p>

<p>And safely brought to Dover, where, inshipped,</p>

<p>Commit them to the fortune of the sea.</p>

<p><center><i>[All except Winchester and Legate exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Winchester</span></p>

<p>Stay, my Lord Legate; you shall first receive</p>

<p>The sum of money which I promised</p>

<p>Should be delivered to his Holiness</p>

<p>For clothing me in these grave ornaments.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Legate</span></p>

<p>I will attend upon your Lordship’s leisure.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Winchester</span></p>

<p>Now Winchester will not submit, I trow,</p>

<p>Or be inferior to the proudest peer.</p>

<p>Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive</p>

<p>That neither in birth or for authority</p>

<p>The Bishop will be overborne by thee.</p>

<p>I’ll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee,</p>

<p>Or sack this country with a mutiny.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
