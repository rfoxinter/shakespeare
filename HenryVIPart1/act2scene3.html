<p><center><i>[Enter Countess of Auvergne, with Porter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span></p>

<p>Porter, remember what I gave in charge,</p>

<p>And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Porter</span>  Madam, I will.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span></p>

<p>The plot is laid. If all things fall out right,</p>

<p>I shall as famous be by this exploit</p>

<p>As Scythian Tamyris by Cyrus’ death.</p>

<p>Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,</p>

<p>And his achievements of no less account.</p>

<p>Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears</p>

<p>To give their censure of these rare reports.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Messenger and Talbot.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Madam, according as your Ladyship desired,</p>

<p>By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span></p>

<p>And he is welcome. What, is this the man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Madam, it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  Is this the scourge of France?</p>

<p>Is this the Talbot, so much feared abroad</p>

<p>That with his name the mothers still their babes?</p>

<p>I see report is fabulous and false.</p>

<p>I thought I should have seen some Hercules,</p>

<p>A second Hector, for his grim aspect</p>

<p>And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.</p>

<p>Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!</p>

<p>It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp</p>

<p>Should strike such terror to his enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Madam, I have been bold to trouble you.</p>

<p>But since your Ladyship is not at leisure,</p>

<p>I’ll sort some other time to visit you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He begins to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span> <i>[to Messenger]</i></p>

<p>What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Stay, my Lord Talbot, for my lady craves</p>

<p>To know the cause of your abrupt departure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Marry, for that she’s in a wrong belief,</p>

<p>I go to certify her Talbot’s here.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Porter with keys.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span> <i>[to Talbot]</i></p>

<p>If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Prisoner? To whom?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  To me, bloodthirsty lord.</p>

<p>And for that cause I trained thee to my house.</p>

<p>Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,</p>

<p>For in my gallery thy picture hangs.</p>

<p>But now the substance shall endure the like,</p>

<p>And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,</p>

<p>That hast by tyranny these many years</p>

<p>Wasted our country, slain our citizens,</p>

<p>And sent our sons and husbands captivate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span>  Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span></p>

<p>Laughest thou, wretch? Thy mirth shall turn to moan.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>I laugh to see your Ladyship so fond</p>

<p>To think that you have aught but Talbot’s shadow</p>

<p>Whereon to practice your severity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  Why, art not thou the man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span>  I am, indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span>  Then have I substance too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>No, no, I am but shadow of myself.</p>

<p>You are deceived; my substance is not here,</p>

<p>For what you see is but the smallest part</p>

<p>And least proportion of humanity.</p>

<p>I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,</p>

<p>It is of such a spacious lofty pitch</p>

<p>Your roof were not sufficient to contain ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span></p>

<p>This is a riddling merchant for the nonce:</p>

<p>He will be here and yet he is not here.</p>

<p>How can these contrarieties agree?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>That will I show you presently.</p>

<p><center><i>[Winds his horn. Drums strike up;</p>

<p>a peal of ordnance.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How say you, madam? Are you now persuaded</p>

<p>That Talbot is but shadow of himself?</p>

<p>These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,</p>

<p>With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,</p>

<p>Razeth your cities, and subverts your towns,</p>

<p>And in a moment makes them desolate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span></p>

<p>Victorious Talbot, pardon my abuse.</p>

<p>I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited,</p>

<p>And more than may be gathered by thy shape.</p>

<p>Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath,</p>

<p>For I am sorry that with reverence</p>

<p>I did not entertain thee as thou art.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Talbot</span></p>

<p>Be not dismayed, fair lady, nor misconster</p>

<p>The mind of Talbot as you did mistake</p>

<p>The outward composition of his body.</p>

<p>What you have done hath not offended me,</p>

<p>Nor other satisfaction do I crave</p>

<p>But only, with your patience, that we may</p>

<p>Taste of your wine and see what cates you have,</p>

<p>For soldiers’ stomachs always serve them well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Countess</span></p>

<p>With all my heart, and think me honored</p>

<p>To feast so great a warrior in my house.</p>
