<p><center><i>[Dead March. Enter the funeral of King Henry the Fifth,</p>

<p>attended on by the Duke of Bedford, Regent of France;</p>

<p>the Earl of Warwick; the Bishop of Winchester; and</p>

<p>the Duke of Somerset, with Heralds and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bedford</span></p>

<p>Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!</p>

<p>Comets, importing change of times and states,</p>

<p>Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,</p>

<p>And with them scourge the bad revolting stars</p>

<p>That have consented unto Henry’s death:</p>

<p>King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long.</p>

<p>England ne’er lost a king of so much worth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>England ne’er had a king until his time.</p>

<p>Virtue he had, deserving to command;</p>

<p>His brandished sword did blind men with his beams;</p>

<p>His arms spread wider than a dragon’s wings;</p>

<p>His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</p>

<p>More dazzled and drove back his enemies</p>

<p>Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces.</p>

<p>What should I say? His deeds exceed all speech.</p>

<p>He ne’er lift up his hand but conquered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>We mourn in black; why mourn we not in blood?</p>

<p>Henry is dead and never shall revive.</p>

<p>Upon a wooden coffin we attend,</p>

<p>And Death’s dishonorable victory</p>

<p>We with our stately presence glorify,</p>

<p>Like captives bound to a triumphant car.</p>

<p>What? Shall we curse the planets of mishap</p>

<p>That plotted thus our glory’s overthrow?</p>

<p>Or shall we think the subtle-witted French</p>

<p>Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,</p>

<p>By magic verses have contrived his end?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Winchester</span></p>

<p>He was a king blest of the King of kings;</p>

<p>Unto the French the dreadful Judgment Day</p>

<p>So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</p>

<p>The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought;</p>

<p>The Church’s prayers made him so prosperous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>The Church? Where is it? Had not churchmen prayed,</p>

<p>His thread of life had not so soon decayed.</p>

<p>None do you like but an effeminate prince</p>

<p>Whom like a schoolboy you may overawe.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Winchester</span></p>

<p>Gloucester, whate’er we like, thou art Protector</p>

<p>And lookest to command the Prince and realm.</p>

<p>Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe</p>

<p>More than God or religious churchmen may.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Name not religion, for thou lov’st the flesh,</p>

<p>And ne’er throughout the year to church thou go’st,</p>

<p>Except it be to pray against thy foes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bedford</span></p>

<p>Cease, cease these jars, and rest your minds in peace!</p>

<p>Let’s to the altar.–Heralds, wait on us.–</p>

<p>Instead of gold, we’ll offer up our arms,</p>

<p>Since arms avail not, now that Henry’s dead.</p>

<p>Posterity, await for wretched years</p>

<p>When at their mothers’ moistened eyes babes shall</p>

<p>suck,</p>

<p>Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,</p>

<p>And none but women left to wail the dead.</p>

<p>Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:</p>

<p>Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,</p>

<p>Combat with adverse planets in the heavens.</p>

<p>A far more glorious star thy soul will make</p>

<p>Than Julius Caesar or bright–</p>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>My honorable lords, health to you all.</p>

<p>Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,</p>

<p>Of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture:</p>

<p>Guyen, Champaigne, Rheims, Roan, Orleance,</p>

<p>Paris, Gisors, Poitiers, are all quite lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bedford</span></p>

<p>What say’st thou, man, before dead Henry’s corse?</p>

<p>Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns</p>

<p>Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Is Paris lost? Is Roan yielded up?</p>

<p>If Henry were recalled to life again,</p>

<p>These news would cause him once more yield the</p>

<p>ghost.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>How were they lost? What treachery was used?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>No treachery, but want of men and money.</p>

<p>Amongst the soldiers, this is muttered:</p>

<p>That here you maintain several factions</p>

<p>And, whilst a field should be dispatched and fought,</p>

<p>You are disputing of your generals.</p>

<p>One would have ling’ring wars with little cost;</p>

<p>Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;</p>

<p>A third thinks, without expense at all,</p>

<p>By guileful fair words peace may be obtained.</p>

<p>Awake, awake, English nobility!</p>

<p>Let not sloth dim your honors new begot.</p>

<p>Cropped are the flower-de-luces in your arms;</p>

<p>Of England’s coat, one half is cut away.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>Were our tears wanting to this funeral,</p>

<p>These tidings would call forth her flowing tides.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bedford</span></p>

<p>Me they concern; regent I am of France.</p>

<p>Give me my steeled coat, I’ll fight for France.</p>

<p>Away with these disgraceful wailing robes.</p>

<p>Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes</p>

<p>To weep their intermissive miseries.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter to them another Messenger, with papers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Lords, view these letters, full of bad mischance.</p>

<p>France is revolted from the English quite,</p>

<p>Except some petty towns of no import.</p>

<p>The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims;</p>

<p>The Bastard of Orleance with him is joined;</p>

<p>Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;</p>

<p>The Duke of Alanson flieth to his side.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>The Dauphin crowned king? All fly to him?</p>

<p>O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>We will not fly but to our enemies’ throats.–</p>

<p>Bedford, if thou be slack, I’ll fight it out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bedford</span></p>

<p>Gloucester, why doubt’st thou of my forwardness?</p>

<p>An army have I mustered in my thoughts,</p>

<p>Wherewith already France is overrun.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter another Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>My gracious lords, to add to your laments,</p>

<p>Wherewith you now bedew King Henry’s hearse,</p>

<p>I must inform you of a dismal fight</p>

<p>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Winchester</span></p>

<p>What? Wherein Talbot overcame, is ’t so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>O no, wherein Lord Talbot was o’erthrown.</p>

<p>The circumstance I’ll tell you more at large.</p>

<p>The tenth of August last, this dreadful lord,</p>

<p>Retiring from the siege of Orleance,</p>

<p>Having full scarce six thousand in his troop,</p>

<p>By three and twenty thousand of the French</p>

<p>Was round encompassed and set upon.</p>

<p>No leisure had he to enrank his men.</p>

<p>He wanted pikes to set before his archers,</p>

<p>Instead whereof, sharp stakes plucked out of hedges</p>

<p>They pitched in the ground confusedly</p>

<p>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</p>

<p>More than three hours the fight continued,</p>

<p>Where valiant Talbot, above human thought,</p>

<p>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance.</p>

<p>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</p>

<p>Here, there, and everywhere, enraged, he slew.</p>

<p>The French exclaimed the devil was in arms;</p>

<p>All the whole army stood agazed on him.</p>

<p>His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,</p>

<p>“A Talbot! A Talbot!” cried out amain</p>

<p>And rushed into the bowels of the battle.</p>

<p>Here had the conquest fully been sealed up</p>

<p>If Sir John Fastolf had not played the coward.</p>

<p>He, being in the vaward, placed behind</p>

<p>With purpose to relieve and follow them,</p>

<p>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</p>

<p>Hence grew the general wrack and massacre.</p>

<p>Enclosed were they with their enemies.</p>

<p>A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin’s grace,</p>

<p>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</p>

<p>Whom all France, with their chief assembled</p>

<p>strength,</p>

<p>Durst not presume to look once in the face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bedford</span></p>

<p>Is Talbot slain then? I will slay myself</p>

<p>For living idly here, in pomp and ease,</p>

<p>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</p>

<p>Unto his dastard foemen is betrayed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>O, no, he lives, but is took prisoner,</p>

<p>And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford;</p>

<p>Most of the rest slaughtered or took likewise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bedford</span></p>

<p>His ransom there is none but I shall pay.</p>

<p>I’ll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne;</p>

<p>His crown shall be the ransom of my friend.</p>

<p>Four of their lords I’ll change for one of ours.</p>

<p>Farewell, my masters; to my task will I.</p>

<p>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</p>

<p>To keep our great Saint George’s feast withal.</p>

<p>Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</p>

<p>Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>So you had need; ’fore Orleance besieged,</p>

<p>The English army is grown weak and faint;</p>

<p>The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply</p>

<p>And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,</p>

<p>Since they so few watch such a multitude.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn:</p>

<p>Either to quell the Dauphin utterly</p>

<p>Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bedford</span></p>

<p>I do remember it, and here take my leave</p>

<p>To go about my preparation.     <i><i>[Bedford exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>I’ll to the Tower with all the haste I can</p>

<p>To view th’ artillery and munition,</p>

<p>And then I will proclaim young Henry king.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gloucester exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Exeter</span></p>

<p>To Eltham will I, where the young king is,</p>

<p>Being ordained his special governor;</p>

<p>And for his safety there I’ll best devise.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Winchester</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Each hath his place and function to attend.</p>

<p>I am left out; for me nothing remains.</p>

<p>But long I will not be Jack-out-of-office.</p>

<p>The King from Eltham I intend to steal,</p>

<p>And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits at one door; at another door,</p>

<p>Warwick, Somerset, Attendants and</p>

<p>Heralds exit with the coffin.]</i></center></p>
