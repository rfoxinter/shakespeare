<p><center><i>[Enter on the walls a French Sergeant of a Band,</p>

<p>with two Sentinels.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sergeant</sc></p>

<p>Sirs, take your places and be vigilant.</p>

<p>If any noise or soldier you perceive</p>

<p>Near to the walls, by some apparent sign</p>

<p>Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sentinel</sc></p>

<p>Sergeant, you shall.     <i><i>[Sergeant exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Thus are poor servitors,</p>

<p>When others sleep upon their quiet beds,</p>

<p>Constrained to watch in darkness, rain, and cold.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Talbot, Bedford, and Burgundy, below,</p>

<p>with scaling ladders.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,</p>

<p>By whose approach the regions of Artois,</p>

<p>Walloon, and Picardy are friends to us,</p>

<p>This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,</p>

<p>Having all day caroused and banqueted.</p>

<p>Embrace we then this opportunity,</p>

<p>As fitting best to quittance their deceit</p>

<p>Contrived by art and baleful sorcery.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc></p>

<p>Coward of France, how much he wrongs his fame,</p>

<p>Despairing of his own arm’s fortitude,</p>

<p>To join with witches and the help of hell!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc></p>

<p>Traitors have never other company.</p>

<p>But what’s that Pucelle whom they term so pure?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>A maid, they say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc>  A maid? And be so martial?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc></p>

<p>Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,</p>

<p>If underneath the standard of the French</p>

<p>She carry armor as she hath begun.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>Well, let them practice and converse with spirits.</p>

<p>God is our fortress, in whose conquering name</p>

<p>Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc></p>

<p>Ascend, brave Talbot. We will follow thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>Not all together. Better far, I guess,</p>

<p>That we do make our entrance several ways,</p>

<p>That if it chance the one of us do fail,</p>

<p>The other yet may rise against their force.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bedford</sc></p>

<p>Agreed. I’ll to yond corner.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc>  And I to this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Talbot</sc></p>

<p>And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave.</p>

<p>Now, Salisbury, for thee and for the right</p>

<p>Of English Henry, shall this night appear</p>

<p>How much in duty I am bound to both.</p>

<p><center><i>[Scaling the walls, they cry</p>

<p>“Saint George! A Talbot!”]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sentinel</sc></p>

<p>Arm, arm! The enemy doth make assault.</p>

<p><center><i>[The English, pursuing the Sentinels, exit aloft.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[The French leap o’er the walls in their shirts.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter several ways, Bastard, Alanson, Reignier,</p>

<p>half ready, and half unready.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc></p>

<p>How now, my lords? What, all unready so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>Unready? Ay, and glad we scaped so well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc></p>

<p>’Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,</p>

<p>Hearing alarums at our chamber doors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc></p>

<p>Of all exploits since first I followed arms</p>

<p>Ne’er heard I of a warlike enterprise</p>

<p>More venturous or desperate than this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc></p>

<p>If not of hell, the heavens sure favor him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc></p>

<p>Here cometh Charles. I marvel how he sped.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Charles and Joan la Pucelle.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?</p>

<p>Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,</p>

<p>Make us partakers of a little gain</p>

<p>That now our loss might be ten times so much?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend?</p>

<p>At all times will you have my power alike?</p>

<p>Sleeping or waking, must I still prevail,</p>

<p>Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?–</p>

<p>Improvident soldiers, had your watch been good,</p>

<p>This sudden mischief never could have fall’n.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>Duke of Alanson, this was your default,</p>

<p>That, being captain of the watch tonight,</p>

<p>Did look no better to that weighty charge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alanson</sc></p>

<p>Had all your quarters been as safely kept</p>

<p>As that whereof I had the government,</p>

<p>We had not been thus shamefully surprised.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bastard</sc></p>

<p>Mine was secure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Reignier</sc>  And so was mine, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Charles</sc></p>

<p>And for myself, most part of all this night</p>

<p>Within her quarter and mine own precinct</p>

<p>I was employed in passing to and fro</p>

<p>About relieving of the sentinels.</p>

<p>Then how or which way should they first break in?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pucelle</sc></p>

<p>Question, my lords, no further of the case,</p>

<p>How or which way; ’tis sure they found some place</p>

<p>But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.</p>

<p>And now there rests no other shift but this:</p>

<p>To gather our soldiers, scattered and dispersed,</p>

<p>And lay new platforms to endamage them.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying,</p>

<p>“A Talbot, A Talbot!” The French fly,</p>

<p>leaving their clothes behind.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Soldier</sc></p>

<p>I’ll be so bold to take what they have left.</p>

<p>The cry of “Talbot” serves me for a sword,</p>

<p>For I have loaden me with many spoils,</p>

<p>Using no other weapon but his name.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
