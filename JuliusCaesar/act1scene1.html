<p><center><i>[Enter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners,</p>

<p>including a Carpenter and a Cobbler, over the stage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc></p>

<p>Hence! Home, you idle creatures, get you home!</p>

<p>Is this a holiday? What, know you not,</p>

<p>Being mechanical, you ought not walk</p>

<p>Upon a laboring day without the sign</p>

<p>Of your profession?–Speak, what trade art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Carpenter</sc>  Why, sir, a carpenter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marullus</sc></p>

<p>Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?</p>

<p>What dost thou with thy best apparel on?–</p>

<p>You, sir, what trade are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cobbler</sc>  Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am</p>

<p>but, as you would say, a cobbler.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marullus</sc></p>

<p>But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cobbler</sc>  A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe</p>

<p>conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad</p>

<p>soles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc></p>

<p>What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what</p>

<p>trade?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cobbler</sc>  Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me.</p>

<p>Yet if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marullus</sc></p>

<p>What mean’st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy</p>

<p>fellow?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cobbler</sc>  Why, sir, cobble you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc>  Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cobbler</sc>  Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the</p>

<p>awl. I meddle with no tradesman’s matters nor</p>

<p>women’s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir, a</p>

<p>surgeon to old shoes: when they are in great danger,</p>

<p>I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon</p>

<p>neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc></p>

<p>But wherefore art not in thy shop today?</p>

<p>Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cobbler</sc>  Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to</p>

<p>get myself into more work. But indeed, sir, we</p>

<p>make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his</p>

<p>triumph.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marullus</sc></p>

<p>Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?</p>

<p>What tributaries follow him to Rome</p>

<p>To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?</p>

<p>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless</p>

<p>things!</p>

<p>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</p>

<p>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</p>

<p>Have you climbed up to walls and battlements,</p>

<p>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,</p>

<p>Your infants in your arms, and there have sat</p>

<p>The livelong day, with patient expectation,</p>

<p>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.</p>

<p>And when you saw his chariot but appear,</p>

<p>Have you not made an universal shout,</p>

<p>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks</p>

<p>To hear the replication of your sounds</p>

<p>Made in her concave shores?</p>

<p>And do you now put on your best attire?</p>

<p>And do you now cull out a holiday?</p>

<p>And do you now strew flowers in his way</p>

<p>That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?</p>

<p>Be gone!</p>

<p>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</p>

<p>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</p>

<p>That needs must light on this ingratitude.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc></p>

<p>Go, go, good countrymen, and for this fault</p>

<p>Assemble all the poor men of your sort,</p>

<p>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</p>

<p>Into the channel, till the lowest stream</p>

<p>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</p>

<p><center><i>[All the Commoners exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>See whe’er their basest mettle be not moved.</p>

<p>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</p>

<p>Go you down that way towards the Capitol.</p>

<p>This way will I. Disrobe the images</p>

<p>If you do find them decked with ceremonies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marullus</sc>  May we do so?</p>

<p>You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flavius</sc></p>

<p>It is no matter. Let no images</p>

<p>Be hung with Caesar’s trophies. I’ll about</p>

<p>And drive away the vulgar from the streets;</p>

<p>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</p>

<p>These growing feathers plucked from Caesar’s wing</p>

<p>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</p>

<p>Who else would soar above the view of men</p>

<p>And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit in different directions.]</i></center></p>
