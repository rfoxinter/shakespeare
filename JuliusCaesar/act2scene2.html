<p><center><i>[Thunder and lightning. Enter Julius Caesar in his</p>

<p>nightgown.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Nor heaven nor Earth have been at peace tonight.</p>

<p>Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out</p>

<p>“Help ho, they murder Caesar!”–Who’s within?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span>  My lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,</p>

<p>And bring me their opinions of success.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span>  I will, my lord.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Calphurnia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Calphurnia</span></p>

<p>What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?</p>

<p>You shall not stir out of your house today.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Caesar shall forth. The things that threatened me</p>

<p>Ne’er looked but on my back. When they shall see</p>

<p>The face of Caesar, they are vanished.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Calphurnia</span></p>

<p>Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,</p>

<p>Yet now they fright me. There is one within,</p>

<p>Besides the things that we have heard and seen,</p>

<p>Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.</p>

<p>A lioness hath whelped in the streets,</p>

<p>And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead.</p>

<p>Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds</p>

<p>In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,</p>

<p>Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol.</p>

<p>The noise of battle hurtled in the air,</p>

<p>Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,</p>

<p>And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.</p>

<p>O Caesar, these things are beyond all use,</p>

<p>And I do fear them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  What can be avoided</p>

<p>Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?</p>

<p>Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions</p>

<p>Are to the world in general as to Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Calphurnia</span></p>

<p>When beggars die there are no comets seen;</p>

<p>The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of</p>

<p>princes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Cowards die many times before their deaths;</p>

<p>The valiant never taste of death but once.</p>

<p>Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,</p>

<p>It seems to me most strange that men should fear,</p>

<p>Seeing that death, a necessary end,</p>

<p>Will come when it will come.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What say the augurers?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span></p>

<p>They would not have you to stir forth today.</p>

<p>Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,</p>

<p>They could not find a heart within the beast.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>The gods do this in shame of cowardice.</p>

<p>Caesar should be a beast without a heart</p>

<p>If he should stay at home today for fear.</p>

<p>No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well</p>

<p>That Caesar is more dangerous than he.</p>

<p>We are two lions littered in one day,</p>

<p>And I the elder and more terrible.</p>

<p>And Caesar shall go forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Calphurnia</span>  Alas, my lord,</p>

<p>Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.</p>

<p>Do not go forth today. Call it my fear</p>

<p>That keeps you in the house, and not your own.</p>

<p>We’ll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,</p>

<p>And he shall say you are not well today.</p>

<p>Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.     <i><i>[She kneels.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Mark Antony shall say I am not well,</p>

<p>And for thy humor I will stay at home.</p>

<p><center><i>[He lifts her up.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Decius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here’s Decius Brutus; he shall tell them so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Decius</span></p>

<p>Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar.</p>

<p>I come to fetch you to the Senate House.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>And you are come in very happy time</p>

<p>To bear my greeting to the Senators</p>

<p>And tell them that I will not come today.</p>

<p>Cannot is false, and that I dare not, falser.</p>

<p>I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Calphurnia</span></p>

<p>Say he is sick.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Shall Caesar send a lie?</p>

<p>Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far,</p>

<p>To be afeard to tell graybeards the truth?</p>

<p>Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Decius</span></p>

<p>Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,</p>

<p>Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>The cause is in my will. I will not come.</p>

<p>That is enough to satisfy the Senate.</p>

<p>But for your private satisfaction,</p>

<p>Because I love you, I will let you know.</p>

<p>Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home.</p>

<p>She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,</p>

<p>Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,</p>

<p>Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans</p>

<p>Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.</p>

<p>And these does she apply for warnings and portents</p>

<p>And evils imminent, and on her knee</p>

<p>Hath begged that I will stay at home today.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Decius</span></p>

<p>This dream is all amiss interpreted.</p>

<p>It was a vision fair and fortunate.</p>

<p>Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,</p>

<p>In which so many smiling Romans bathed,</p>

<p>Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck</p>

<p>Reviving blood, and that great men shall press</p>

<p>For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.</p>

<p>This by Calphurnia’s dream is signified.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>And this way have you well expounded it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Decius</span></p>

<p>I have, when you have heard what I can say.</p>

<p>And know it now: the Senate have concluded</p>

<p>To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.</p>

<p>If you shall send them word you will not come,</p>

<p>Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock</p>

<p>Apt to be rendered, for someone to say</p>

<p>“Break up the Senate till another time,</p>

<p>When Caesar’s wife shall meet with better dreams.”</p>

<p>If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper</p>

<p>“Lo, Caesar is afraid”?</p>

<p>Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love</p>

<p>To your proceeding bids me tell you this,</p>

<p>And reason to my love is liable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia!</p>

<p>I am ashamed I did yield to them.</p>

<p>Give me my robe, for I will go.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca, Trebonius,</p>

<p>Cinna, and Publius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>And look where Publius is come to fetch me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Publius</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Welcome, Publius.–</p>

<p>What, Brutus, are you stirred so early too?–</p>

<p>Good morrow, Casca.–Caius Ligarius,</p>

<p>Caesar was ne’er so much your enemy</p>

<p>As that same ague which hath made you lean.–</p>

<p>What is ’t o’clock?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Caesar, ’tis strucken eight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>I thank you for your pains and courtesy.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antony.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>See, Antony that revels long a-nights</p>

<p>Is notwithstanding up.–Good morrow, Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  So to most noble Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span> <i>[to Servant]</i>  Bid them prepare within.–</p>

<p>I am to blame to be thus waited for.     <i><i>[Servant exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Now, Cinna.–Now, Metellus.–What, Trebonius,</p>

<p>I have an hour’s talk in store for you.</p>

<p>Remember that you call on me today;</p>

<p>Be near me that I may remember you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trebonius</span></p>

<p>Caesar, I will. <i>[Aside.]</i> And so near will I be</p>

<p>That your best friends shall wish I had been further.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,</p>

<p>And we, like friends, will straightway go together.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>That every like is not the same, O Caesar,</p>

<p>The heart of Brutus earns to think upon.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
