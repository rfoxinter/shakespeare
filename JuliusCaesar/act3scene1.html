<p>Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna; Publius,</p>

<p>Popilius, Artemidorus, the Soothsayer, and other</p>

<p>Senators and Petitioners.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  The ides of March are come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Soothsayer</span>  Ay, Caesar, but not gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Artemidorus</span>  Hail, Caesar. Read this schedule.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Decius</span></p>

<p>Trebonius doth desire you to o’erread,</p>

<p>At your best leisure, this his humble suit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Artemidorus</span></p>

<p>O Caesar, read mine first, for mine’s a suit</p>

<p>That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>What touches us ourself shall be last served.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Artemidorus</span></p>

<p>Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>What, is the fellow mad?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Publius</span>  Sirrah, give place.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>What, urge you your petitions in the street?</p>

<p>Come to the Capitol.</p>

<p><center><i>[Caesar goes forward, the rest following.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Popilius</span> <i>[to Cassius]</i></p>

<p>I wish your enterprise today may thrive.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  What enterprise, Popilius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Popilius</span>  Fare you well.     <i><i>[He walks away.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  What said Popilius Lena?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>He wished today our enterprise might thrive.</p>

<p>I fear our purpose is discovered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.–</p>

<p>Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,</p>

<p>Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,</p>

<p>For I will slay myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Cassius, be constant.</p>

<p>Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes,</p>

<p>For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus,</p>

<p>He draws Mark Antony out of the way.</p>

<p><center><i>[Trebonius and Antony exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Decius</span></p>

<p>Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go</p>

<p>And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>He is addressed. Press near and second him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cinna</span></p>

<p>Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>Are we all ready? What is now amiss</p>

<p>That Caesar and his Senate must redress?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Metellus</span> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,</p>

<p>Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat</p>

<p>An humble heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  I must prevent thee, Cimber.</p>

<p>These couchings and these lowly courtesies</p>

<p>Might fire the blood of ordinary men</p>

<p>And turn preordinance and first decree</p>

<p>Into the law of children. Be not fond</p>

<p>To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood</p>

<p>That will be thawed from the true quality</p>

<p>With that which melteth fools–I mean sweet</p>

<p>words,</p>

<p>Low-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel fawning.</p>

<p>Thy brother by decree is banished.</p>

<p>If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,</p>

<p>I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.</p>

<p>Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause</p>

<p>Will he be satisfied.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Metellus</span></p>

<p>Is there no voice more worthy than my own</p>

<p>To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear</p>

<p>For the repealing of my banished brother?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,</p>

<p>Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may</p>

<p>Have an immediate freedom of repeal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>What, Brutus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon!</p>

<p>As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall</p>

<p>To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span></p>

<p>I could be well moved, if I were as you.</p>

<p>If I could pray to move, prayers would move me.</p>

<p>But I am constant as the Northern Star,</p>

<p>Of whose true fixed and resting quality</p>

<p>There is no fellow in the firmament.</p>

<p>The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks;</p>

<p>They are all fire, and every one doth shine.</p>

<p>But there’s but one in all doth hold his place.</p>

<p>So in the world: ’tis furnished well with men,</p>

<p>And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive.</p>

<p>Yet in the number I do know but one</p>

<p>That unassailable holds on his rank,</p>

<p>Unshaked of motion; and that I am he</p>

<p>Let me a little show it, even in this:</p>

<p>That I was constant Cimber should be banished</p>

<p>And constant do remain to keep him so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cinna</span> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>O Caesar–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Decius</span> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Great Caesar–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Casca</span>  Speak, hands, for me!</p>

<p><center><i>[As Casca strikes, the others rise up and stab Caesar.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Caesar</span>  Et tu, Brute?–Then fall, Caesar.</p>

<p><center><i>[He dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cinna</span></p>

<p>Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!</p>

<p>Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Some to the common pulpits and cry out</p>

<p>“Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>People and Senators, be not affrighted.</p>

<p>Fly not; stand still. Ambition’s debt is paid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Casca</span></p>

<p>Go to the pulpit, Brutus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Decius</span>  And Cassius too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Where’s Publius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cinna</span></p>

<p>Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Metellus</span></p>

<p>Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s</p>

<p>Should chance–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Talk not of standing.–Publius, good cheer.</p>

<p>There is no harm intended to your person,</p>

<p>Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>And leave us, Publius, lest that the people,</p>

<p>Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Do so, and let no man abide this deed</p>

<p>But we the doers.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but the Conspirators exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Trebonius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Where is Antony?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Trebonius</span>  Fled to his house amazed.</p>

<p>Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run</p>

<p>As it were doomsday.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Fates, we will know your</p>

<p>pleasures.</p>

<p>That we shall die we know; ’tis but the time,</p>

<p>And drawing days out, that men stand upon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Casca</span></p>

<p>Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life</p>

<p>Cuts off so many years of fearing death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Grant that, and then is death a benefit.</p>

<p>So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged</p>

<p>His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,</p>

<p>And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood</p>

<p>Up to the elbows and besmear our swords.</p>

<p>Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,</p>

<p>And, waving our red weapons o’er our heads,</p>

<p>Let’s all cry “Peace, freedom, and liberty!”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Stoop then, and wash.</p>

<p><center><i>[They smear their hands and swords with Caesar’s blood.]</i></center></p>

<p>How many ages hence</p>

<p>Shall this our lofty scene be acted over</p>

<p>In states unborn and accents yet unknown!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,</p>

<p>That now on Pompey’s basis lies along</p>

<p>No worthier than the dust!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  So oft as that shall be,</p>

<p>So often shall the knot of us be called</p>

<p>The men that gave their country liberty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Decius</span></p>

<p>What, shall we forth?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Ay, every man away.</p>

<p>Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels</p>

<p>With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel.</p>

<p>Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,</p>

<p>And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:</p>

<p>Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;</p>

<p>Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.</p>

<p>Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him;</p>

<p>Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him.</p>

<p>If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony</p>

<p>May safely come to him and be resolved</p>

<p>How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,</p>

<p>Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead</p>

<p>So well as Brutus living, but will follow</p>

<p>The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus</p>

<p>Thorough the hazards of this untrod state</p>

<p>With all true faith. So says my master Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman.</p>

<p>I never thought him worse.</p>

<p>Tell him, so please him come unto this place,</p>

<p>He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,</p>

<p>Depart untouched.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span>  I’ll fetch him presently.</p>

<p><center><i>[Servant exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>I know that we shall have him well to friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>I wish we may; but yet have I a mind</p>

<p>That fears him much, and my misgiving still</p>

<p>Falls shrewdly to the purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antony.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>But here comes Antony.–Welcome, Mark Antony!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low?</p>

<p>Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils</p>

<p>Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.–</p>

<p>I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,</p>

<p>Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.</p>

<p>If I myself, there is no hour so fit</p>

<p>As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument</p>

<p>Of half that worth as those your swords made rich</p>

<p>With the most noble blood of all this world.</p>

<p>I do beseech you, if you bear me hard,</p>

<p>Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,</p>

<p>Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,</p>

<p>I shall not find myself so apt to die;</p>

<p>No place will please me so, no mean of death,</p>

<p>As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,</p>

<p>The choice and master spirits of this age.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>O Antony, beg not your death of us!</p>

<p>Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,</p>

<p>As by our hands and this our present act</p>

<p>You see we do, yet see you but our hands</p>

<p>And this the bleeding business they have done.</p>

<p>Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;</p>

<p>And pity to the general wrong of Rome</p>

<p>(As fire drives out fire, so pity pity)</p>

<p>Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,</p>

<p>To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony.</p>

<p>Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts</p>

<p>Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in</p>

<p>With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s</p>

<p>In the disposing of new dignities.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Only be patient till we have appeased</p>

<p>The multitude, beside themselves with fear;</p>

<p>And then we will deliver you the cause</p>

<p>Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,</p>

<p>Have thus proceeded.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  I doubt not of your wisdom.</p>

<p>Let each man render me his bloody hand.</p>

<p>First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.–</p>

<p>Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.–</p>

<p>Now, Decius Brutus, yours;–now yours,</p>

<p>Metellus;–</p>

<p>Yours, Cinna;–and, my valiant Casca, yours;–</p>

<p>Though last, not least in love, yours, good</p>

<p>Trebonius.–</p>

<p>Gentlemen all–alas, what shall I say?</p>

<p>My credit now stands on such slippery ground</p>

<p>That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,</p>

<p>Either a coward or a flatterer.–</p>

<p>That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true!</p>

<p>If then thy spirit look upon us now,</p>

<p>Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death</p>

<p>To see thy Antony making his peace,</p>

<p>Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes–</p>

<p>Most noble!–in the presence of thy corpse?</p>

<p>Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,</p>

<p>Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,</p>

<p>It would become me better than to close</p>

<p>In terms of friendship with thine enemies.</p>

<p>Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave</p>

<p>hart,</p>

<p>Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand</p>

<p>Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe.</p>

<p>O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,</p>

<p>And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee.</p>

<p>How like a deer strucken by many princes</p>

<p>Dost thou here lie!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Mark Antony–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Pardon me, Caius Cassius.</p>

<p>The enemies of Caesar shall say this;</p>

<p>Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>I blame you not for praising Caesar so.</p>

<p>But what compact mean you to have with us?</p>

<p>Will you be pricked in number of our friends,</p>

<p>Or shall we on and not depend on you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed</p>

<p>Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar.</p>

<p>Friends am I with you all and love you all,</p>

<p>Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons</p>

<p>Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Or else were this a savage spectacle.</p>

<p>Our reasons are so full of good regard</p>

<p>That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,</p>

<p>You should be satisfied.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  That’s all I seek;</p>

<p>And am, moreover, suitor that I may</p>

<p>Produce his body to the marketplace,</p>

<p>And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,</p>

<p>Speak in the order of his funeral.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>You shall, Mark Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Brutus, a word with you.</p>

<p><i>[Aside to Brutus.]</i> You know not what you do. Do</p>

<p>not consent</p>

<p>That Antony speak in his funeral.</p>

<p>Know you how much the people may be moved</p>

<p>By that which he will utter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span> <i>[aside to Cassius]</i>  By your pardon,</p>

<p>I will myself into the pulpit first</p>

<p>And show the reason of our Caesar’s death.</p>

<p>What Antony shall speak I will protest</p>

<p>He speaks by leave and by permission,</p>

<p>And that we are contented Caesar shall</p>

<p>Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.</p>

<p>It shall advantage more than do us wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span> <i>[aside to Brutus]</i></p>

<p>I know not what may fall. I like it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body.</p>

<p>You shall not in your funeral speech blame us</p>

<p>But speak all good you can devise of Caesar</p>

<p>And say you do ’t by our permission,</p>

<p>Else shall you not have any hand at all</p>

<p>About his funeral. And you shall speak</p>

<p>In the same pulpit whereto I am going,</p>

<p>After my speech is ended.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Be it so.</p>

<p>I do desire no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Prepare the body, then, and follow us.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Antony exit.]</i></center></p>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,</p>

<p>That I am meek and gentle with these butchers.</p>

<p>Thou art the ruins of the noblest man</p>

<p>That ever lived in the tide of times.</p>

<p>Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!</p>

<p>Over thy wounds now do I prophesy</p>

<p>(Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips</p>

<p>To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)</p>

<p>A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;</p>

<p>Domestic fury and fierce civil strife</p>

<p>Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;</p>

<p>Blood and destruction shall be so in use</p>

<p>And dreadful objects so familiar</p>

<p>That mothers shall but smile when they behold</p>

<p>Their infants quartered with the hands of war,</p>

<p>All pity choked with custom of fell deeds;</p>

<p>And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge,</p>

<p>With Ate by his side come hot from hell,</p>

<p>Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice</p>

<p>Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war,</p>

<p>That this foul deed shall smell above the earth</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.</p>
