<p><center><i>[Enter Caesar, Antony for the course, Calphurnia, Portia,</p>

<p>Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, a Soothsayer;</p>

<p>after them Marullus and Flavius and Commoners.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>Calphurnia.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Calphurnia.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Calphurnia</sc>  Here, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>Stand you directly in Antonius’ way</p>

<p>When he doth run his course.–Antonius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Caesar, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>Forget not in your speed, Antonius,</p>

<p>To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say</p>

<p>The barren, touched in this holy chase,</p>

<p>Shake off their sterile curse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  I shall remember.</p>

<p>When Caesar says “Do this,” it is performed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>Set on and leave no ceremony out.     <i><i>[Sennet.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Soothsayer</sc>  Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Ha! Who calls?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>Bid every noise be still. Peace, yet again!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>Who is it in the press that calls on me?</p>

<p>I hear a tongue shriller than all the music</p>

<p>Cry “Caesar.” Speak. Caesar is turned to hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Soothsayer</sc></p>

<p>Beware the ides of March.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  What man is that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>Set him before me. Let me see his face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Fellow, come from the throng.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Soothsayer comes forward.]</i></center></p>

<p>Look upon Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Soothsayer</sc>  Beware the ides of March.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sennet. All but Brutus and Cassius exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Will you go see the order of the course?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Not I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  I pray you, do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>I am not gamesome. I do lack some part</p>

<p>Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.</p>

<p>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Brutus, I do observe you now of late.</p>

<p>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</p>

<p>And show of love as I was wont to have.</p>

<p>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</p>

<p>Over your friend that loves you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Cassius,</p>

<p>Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look,</p>

<p>I turn the trouble of my countenance</p>

<p>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</p>

<p>Of late with passions of some difference,</p>

<p>Conceptions only proper to myself,</p>

<p>Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors.</p>

<p>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved</p>

<p>(Among which number, Cassius, be you one)</p>

<p>Nor construe any further my neglect</p>

<p>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</p>

<p>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,</p>

<p>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</p>

<p>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</p>

<p>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself</p>

<p>But by reflection, by some other things.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  ’Tis just.</p>

<p>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</p>

<p>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</p>

<p>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</p>

<p>That you might see your shadow. I have heard</p>

<p>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</p>

<p>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</p>

<p>And groaning underneath this age’s yoke,</p>

<p>Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</p>

<p>That you would have me seek into myself</p>

<p>For that which is not in me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear.</p>

<p>And since you know you cannot see yourself</p>

<p>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</p>

<p>Will modestly discover to yourself</p>

<p>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</p>

<p>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.</p>

<p>Were I a common laughter, or did use</p>

<p>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</p>

<p>To every new protester; if you know</p>

<p>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</p>

<p>And after scandal them, or if you know</p>

<p>That I profess myself in banqueting</p>

<p>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish and shout.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>What means this shouting? I do fear the people</p>

<p>Choose Caesar for their king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  Ay, do you fear it?</p>

<p>Then must I think you would not have it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.</p>

<p>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</p>

<p>What is it that you would impart to me?</p>

<p>If it be aught toward the general good,</p>

<p>Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other</p>

<p>And I will look on both indifferently;</p>

<p>For let the gods so speed me as I love</p>

<p>The name of honor more than I fear death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</p>

<p>As well as I do know your outward favor.</p>

<p>Well, honor is the subject of my story.</p>

<p>I cannot tell what you and other men</p>

<p>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</p>

<p>I had as lief not be as live to be</p>

<p>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</p>

<p>I was born free as Caesar; so were you;</p>

<p>We both have fed as well, and we can both</p>

<p>Endure the winter’s cold as well as he.</p>

<p>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</p>

<p>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</p>

<p>Caesar said to me “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now</p>

<p>Leap in with me into this angry flood</p>

<p>And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,</p>

<p>Accoutered as I was, I plunged in</p>

<p>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</p>

<p>The torrent roared, and we did buffet it</p>

<p>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</p>

<p>And stemming it with hearts of controversy.</p>

<p>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</p>

<p>Caesar cried “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!”</p>

<p>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</p>

<p>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</p>

<p>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</p>

<p>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</p>

<p>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</p>

<p>A wretched creature and must bend his body</p>

<p>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</p>

<p>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</p>

<p>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</p>

<p>How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake.</p>

<p>His coward lips did from their color fly,</p>

<p>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</p>

<p>Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan.</p>

<p>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</p>

<p>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</p>

<p>“Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius”</p>

<p>As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me</p>

<p>A man of such a feeble temper should</p>

<p>So get the start of the majestic world</p>

<p>And bear the palm alone.</p>

<p><center><i>[Shout. Flourish.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Another general shout!</p>

<p>I do believe that these applauses are</p>

<p>For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</p>

<p>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</p>

<p>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</p>

<p>To find ourselves dishonorable graves.</p>

<p>Men at some time are masters of their fates.</p>

<p>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</p>

<p>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</p>

<p>“Brutus” and “Caesar”–what should be in that</p>

<p>“Caesar”?</p>

<p>Why should that name be sounded more than</p>

<p>yours?</p>

<p>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</p>

<p>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</p>

<p>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,</p>

<p>“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”</p>

<p>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</p>

<p>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed</p>

<p>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</p>

<p>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</p>

<p>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</p>

<p>But it was famed with more than with one man?</p>

<p>When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,</p>

<p>That her wide walks encompassed but one man?</p>

<p>Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough</p>

<p>When there is in it but one only man.</p>

<p>O, you and I have heard our fathers say</p>

<p>There was a Brutus once that would have brooked</p>

<p>Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</p>

<p>As easily as a king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.</p>

<p>What you would work me to, I have some aim.</p>

<p>How I have thought of this, and of these times,</p>

<p>I shall recount hereafter. For this present,</p>

<p>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</p>

<p>Be any further moved. What you have said</p>

<p>I will consider; what you have to say</p>

<p>I will with patience hear, and find a time</p>

<p>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</p>

<p>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</p>

<p>Brutus had rather be a villager</p>

<p>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</p>

<p>Under these hard conditions as this time</p>

<p>Is like to lay upon us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  I am glad that my weak words</p>

<p>Have struck but thus much show of fire from</p>

<p>Brutus.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Caesar and his train.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>The games are done, and Caesar is returning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,</p>

<p>And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you</p>

<p>What hath proceeded worthy note today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>I will do so. But look you, Cassius,</p>

<p>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow,</p>

<p>And all the rest look like a chidden train.</p>

<p>Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero</p>

<p>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</p>

<p>As we have seen him in the Capitol,</p>

<p>Being crossed in conference by some senators.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Casca will tell us what the matter is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc>  Antonius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>Let me have men about me that are fat,</p>

<p>Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights.</p>

<p>Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.</p>

<p>He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous.</p>

<p>He is a noble Roman, and well given.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Caesar</sc></p>

<p>Would he were fatter! But I fear him not.</p>

<p>Yet if my name were liable to fear,</p>

<p>I do not know the man I should avoid</p>

<p>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,</p>

<p>He is a great observer, and he looks</p>

<p>Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,</p>

<p>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</p>

<p>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</p>

<p>As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit</p>

<p>That could be moved to smile at anything.</p>

<p>Such men as he be never at heart’s ease</p>

<p>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</p>

<p>And therefore are they very dangerous.</p>

<p>I rather tell thee what is to be feared</p>

<p>Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</p>

<p>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</p>

<p>And tell me truly what thou think’st of him.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sennet. Caesar and his train exit</p>

<p>but Casca remains behind.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak</p>

<p>with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today</p>

<p>That Caesar looks so sad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Why, you were with him, were you not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being</p>

<p>offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,</p>

<p>thus, and then the people fell a-shouting.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  What was the second noise for?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Why, for that too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Why, for that too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Was the crown offered him thrice?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every</p>

<p>time gentler than other; and at every putting-by,</p>

<p>mine honest neighbors shouted.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  Who offered him the crown?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Why, Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it.</p>

<p>It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</p>

<p>Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown</p>

<p>neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told</p>

<p>you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my</p>

<p>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered</p>

<p>it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my</p>

<p>thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.</p>

<p>And then he offered it the third time. He put it the</p>

<p>third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement</p>

<p>hooted and clapped their chopped hands and</p>

<p>threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a</p>

<p>deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the</p>

<p>crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he</p>

<p>swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part,</p>

<p>I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and</p>

<p>receiving the bad air.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at</p>

<p>mouth and was speechless.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I</p>

<p>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  I know not what you mean by that, but I am</p>

<p>sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</p>

<p>clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</p>

<p>displeased them, as they use to do the players in the</p>

<p>theater, I am no true man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>What said he when he came unto himself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived</p>

<p>the common herd was glad he refused the crown,</p>

<p>he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</p>

<p>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation,</p>

<p>if I would not have taken him at a word, I</p>

<p>would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</p>

<p>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he</p>

<p>had done or said anything amiss, he desired their</p>

<p>Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four</p>

<p>wenches where I stood cried “Alas, good soul!” and</p>

<p>forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no</p>

<p>heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed</p>

<p>their mothers, they would have done no less.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>And, after that, he came thus sad away?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  Did Cicero say anything?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Ay, he spoke Greek.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  To what effect?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’</p>

<p>face again. But those that understood him smiled at</p>

<p>one another and shook their heads. But for mine</p>

<p>own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more</p>

<p>news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves</p>

<p>off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you</p>

<p>well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember</p>

<p>it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  No, I am promised forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  Will you dine with me tomorrow?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your</p>

<p>dinner worth the eating.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  Good. I will expect you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Do so. Farewell both.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!</p>

<p>He was quick mettle when he went to school.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>So is he now in execution</p>

<p>Of any bold or noble enterprise,</p>

<p>However he puts on this tardy form.</p>

<p>This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,</p>

<p>Which gives men stomach to digest his words</p>

<p>With better appetite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>And so it is. For this time I will leave you.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,</p>

<p>I will come home to you; or, if you will,</p>

<p>Come home to me, and I will wait for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>I will do so. Till then, think of the world.</p>

<p><center><i>[Brutus exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see</p>

<p>Thy honorable mettle may be wrought</p>

<p>From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet</p>

<p>That noble minds keep ever with their likes;</p>

<p>For who so firm that cannot be seduced?</p>

<p>Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.</p>

<p>If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,</p>

<p>He should not humor me. I will this night</p>

<p>In several hands in at his windows throw,</p>

<p>As if they came from several citizens,</p>

<p>Writings, all tending to the great opinion</p>

<p>That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely</p>

<p>Caesar’s ambition shall be glanced at</p>

<p>And after this, let Caesar seat him sure,</p>

<p>For we will shake him, or worse days endure.</p>
