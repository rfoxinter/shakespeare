<p><center><i>[Enter Brutus in his orchard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  What, Lucius, ho!–</p>

<p>I cannot by the progress of the stars</p>

<p>Give guess how near to day.–Lucius, I say!–</p>

<p>I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.–</p>

<p>When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  Called you, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.</p>

<p>When it is lighted, come and call me here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  I will, my lord.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>It must be by his death. And for my part</p>

<p>I know no personal cause to spurn at him,</p>

<p>But for the general. He would be crowned:</p>

<p>How that might change his nature, there’s the</p>

<p>question.</p>

<p>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,</p>

<p>And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,</p>

<p>And then I grant we put a sting in him</p>

<p>That at his will he may do danger with.</p>

<p>Th’ abuse of greatness is when it disjoins</p>

<p>Remorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar,</p>

<p>I have not known when his affections swayed</p>

<p>More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof</p>

<p>That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,</p>

<p>Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;</p>

<p>But, when he once attains the upmost round,</p>

<p>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</p>

<p>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</p>

<p>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</p>

<p>Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel</p>

<p>Will bear no color for the thing he is,</p>

<p>Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,</p>

<p>Would run to these and these extremities.</p>

<p>And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg,</p>

<p>Which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow</p>

<p>mischievous,</p>

<p>And kill him in the shell.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>The taper burneth in your closet, sir.</p>

<p>Searching the window for a flint, I found</p>

<p>This paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure</p>

<p>It did not lie there when I went to bed.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gives him the letter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Get you to bed again. It is not day.</p>

<p>Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  I know not, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Look in the calendar, and bring me word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  I will, sir.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>The exhalations, whizzing in the air,</p>

<p>Give so much light that I may read by them.</p>

<p><center><i>[Opens the letter and reads.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Brutus, thou sleep’st. Awake, and see thyself!</p>

<p>Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!</p>

<p>“Brutus, thou sleep’st. Awake.”</p>

<p>Such instigations have been often dropped</p>

<p>Where I have took them up.</p>

<p>“Shall Rome, etc.” Thus must I piece it out:</p>

<p>Shall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What,</p>

<p>Rome?</p>

<p>My ancestors did from the streets of Rome</p>

<p>The Tarquin drive when he was called a king.</p>

<p>“Speak, strike, redress!” Am I entreated</p>

<p>To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,</p>

<p>If the redress will follow, thou receivest</p>

<p>Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc>  Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.</p>

<p><center><i>[Knock within.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>’Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lucius exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,</p>

<p>I have not slept.</p>

<p>Between the acting of a dreadful thing</p>

<p>And the first motion, all the interim is</p>

<p>Like a phantasma or a hideous dream.</p>

<p>The genius and the mortal instruments</p>

<p>Are then in council, and the state of man,</p>

<p>Like to a little kingdom, suffers then</p>

<p>The nature of an insurrection.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Sir, ’tis your brother Cassius at the door,</p>

<p>Who doth desire to see you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Is he alone?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>No, sir. There are more with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Do you know</p>

<p>them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>No, sir. Their hats are plucked about their ears,</p>

<p>And half their faces buried in their cloaks,</p>

<p>That by no means I may discover them</p>

<p>By any mark of favor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Let ’em enter.     <i><i>[Lucius exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>They are the faction. O conspiracy,</p>

<p>Sham’st thou to show thy dang’rous brow by night,</p>

<p>When evils are most free? O, then, by day</p>

<p>Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough</p>

<p>To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none,</p>

<p>conspiracy.</p>

<p>Hide it in smiles and affability;</p>

<p>For if thou path, thy native semblance on,</p>

<p>Not Erebus itself were dim enough</p>

<p>To hide thee from prevention.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna,</p>

<p>Metellus, and Trebonius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>I think we are too bold upon your rest.</p>

<p>Good morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>I have been up this hour, awake all night.</p>

<p>Know I these men that come along with you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Yes, every man of them; and no man here</p>

<p>But honors you, and every one doth wish</p>

<p>You had but that opinion of yourself</p>

<p>Which every noble Roman bears of you.</p>

<p>This is Trebonius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  He is welcome hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>This, Decius Brutus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  He is welcome too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  They are all welcome.</p>

<p>What watchful cares do interpose themselves</p>

<p>Betwixt your eyes and night?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  Shall I entreat a word?</p>

<p><center><i>[Brutus and Cassius whisper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Decius</sc></p>

<p>Here lies the east; doth not the day break here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cinna</sc></p>

<p>O pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines</p>

<p>That fret the clouds are messengers of day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>You shall confess that you are both deceived.</p>

<p>Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,</p>

<p>Which is a great way growing on the south,</p>

<p>Weighing the youthful season of the year.</p>

<p>Some two months hence, up higher toward the</p>

<p>north</p>

<p>He first presents his fire, and the high east</p>

<p>Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc> <i>[coming forward with Cassius]</i></p>

<p>Give me your hands all over, one by one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>And let us swear our resolution.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>No, not an oath. If not the face of men,</p>

<p>The sufferance of our souls, the time’s abuse–</p>

<p>If these be motives weak, break off betimes,</p>

<p>And every man hence to his idle bed.</p>

<p>So let high-sighted tyranny range on</p>

<p>Till each man drop by lottery. But if these–</p>

<p>As I am sure they do–bear fire enough</p>

<p>To kindle cowards and to steel with valor</p>

<p>The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,</p>

<p>What need we any spur but our own cause</p>

<p>To prick us to redress? What other bond</p>

<p>Than secret Romans that have spoke the word</p>

<p>And will not palter? And what other oath</p>

<p>Than honesty to honesty engaged</p>

<p>That this shall be or we will fall for it?</p>

<p>Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,</p>

<p>Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls</p>

<p>That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear</p>

<p>Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain</p>

<p>The even virtue of our enterprise,</p>

<p>Nor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits,</p>

<p>To think that or our cause or our performance</p>

<p>Did need an oath, when every drop of blood</p>

<p>That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,</p>

<p>Is guilty of a several bastardy</p>

<p>If he do break the smallest particle</p>

<p>Of any promise that hath passed from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?</p>

<p>I think he will stand very strong with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>Let us not leave him out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cinna</sc>  No, by no means.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Metellus</sc></p>

<p>O, let us have him, for his silver hairs</p>

<p>Will purchase us a good opinion</p>

<p>And buy men’s voices to commend our deeds.</p>

<p>It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands.</p>

<p>Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,</p>

<p>But all be buried in his gravity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>O, name him not! Let us not break with him,</p>

<p>For he will never follow anything</p>

<p>That other men begin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  Then leave him out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Indeed, he is not fit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Decius</sc></p>

<p>Shall no man else be touched, but only Caesar?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet</p>

<p>Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,</p>

<p>Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him</p>

<p>A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,</p>

<p>If he improve them, may well stretch so far</p>

<p>As to annoy us all; which to prevent,</p>

<p>Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</p>

<p>To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,</p>

<p>Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;</p>

<p>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.</p>

<p>Let’s be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.</p>

<p>We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,</p>

<p>And in the spirit of men there is no blood.</p>

<p>O, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit</p>

<p>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</p>

<p>Caesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends,</p>

<p>Let’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully.</p>

<p>Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</p>

<p>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.</p>

<p>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</p>

<p>Stir up their servants to an act of rage</p>

<p>And after seem to chide ’em. This shall make</p>

<p>Our purpose necessary and not envious;</p>

<p>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</p>

<p>We shall be called purgers, not murderers.</p>

<p>And for Mark Antony, think not of him,</p>

<p>For he can do no more than Caesar’s arm</p>

<p>When Caesar’s head is off.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  Yet I fear him,</p>

<p>For in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.</p>

<p>If he love Caesar, all that he can do</p>

<p>Is to himself: take thought and die for Caesar.</p>

<p>And that were much he should, for he is given</p>

<p>To sports, to wildness, and much company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trebonius</sc></p>

<p>There is no fear in him. Let him not die,</p>

<p>For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.</p>

<p><center><i>[Clock strikes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Peace, count the clock.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  The clock hath stricken</p>

<p>three.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Trebonius</sc></p>

<p>’Tis time to part.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  But it is doubtful yet</p>

<p>Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,</p>

<p>For he is superstitious grown of late,</p>

<p>Quite from the main opinion he held once</p>

<p>Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.</p>

<p>It may be these apparent prodigies,</p>

<p>The unaccustomed terror of this night,</p>

<p>And the persuasion of his augurers</p>

<p>May hold him from the Capitol today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Decius</sc></p>

<p>Never fear that. If he be so resolved,</p>

<p>I can o’ersway him, for he loves to hear</p>

<p>That unicorns may be betrayed with trees,</p>

<p>And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,</p>

<p>Lions with toils, and men with flatterers.</p>

<p>But when I tell him he hates flatterers,</p>

<p>He says he does, being then most flattered.</p>

<p>Let me work,</p>

<p>For I can give his humor the true bent,</p>

<p>And I will bring him to the Capitol.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>By the eighth hour, is that the uttermost?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cinna</sc></p>

<p>Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Metellus</sc></p>

<p>Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,</p>

<p>Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.</p>

<p>I wonder none of you have thought of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Now, good Metellus, go along by him.</p>

<p>He loves me well, and I have given him reasons.</p>

<p>Send him but hither, and I’ll fashion him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>The morning comes upon ’s. We’ll leave you,</p>

<p>Brutus.</p>

<p>And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember</p>

<p>What you have said, and show yourselves true</p>

<p>Romans.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.</p>

<p>Let not our looks put on our purposes,</p>

<p>But bear it, as our Roman actors do,</p>

<p>With untired spirits and formal constancy.</p>

<p>And so good morrow to you every one.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Brutus exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Boy! Lucius!–Fast asleep? It is no matter.</p>

<p>Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber.</p>

<p>Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies</p>

<p>Which busy care draws in the brains of men.</p>

<p>Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Portia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc>  Brutus, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Portia! What mean you? Wherefore rise you now?</p>

<p>It is not for your health thus to commit</p>

<p>Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>Nor for yours neither. You’ve ungently, Brutus,</p>

<p>Stole from my bed. And yesternight at supper</p>

<p>You suddenly arose and walked about,</p>

<p>Musing and sighing, with your arms across,</p>

<p>And when I asked you what the matter was,</p>

<p>You stared upon me with ungentle looks.</p>

<p>I urged you further; then you scratched your head</p>

<p>And too impatiently stamped with your foot.</p>

<p>Yet I insisted; yet you answered not,</p>

<p>But with an angry wafture of your hand</p>

<p>Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,</p>

<p>Fearing to strengthen that impatience</p>

<p>Which seemed too much enkindled, and withal</p>

<p>Hoping it was but an effect of humor,</p>

<p>Which sometime hath his hour with every man.</p>

<p>It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep,</p>

<p>And could it work so much upon your shape</p>

<p>As it hath much prevailed on your condition,</p>

<p>I should not know you Brutus. Dear my lord,</p>

<p>Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>I am not well in health, and that is all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>Brutus is wise and, were he not in health,</p>

<p>He would embrace the means to come by it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Why so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>Is Brutus sick? And is it physical</p>

<p>To walk unbraced and suck up the humors</p>

<p>Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,</p>

<p>And will he steal out of his wholesome bed</p>

<p>To dare the vile contagion of the night</p>

<p>And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air</p>

<p>To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,</p>

<p>You have some sick offense within your mind,</p>

<p>Which by the right and virtue of my place</p>

<p>I ought to know of. <i>[She kneels.]</i> And upon my</p>

<p>knees</p>

<p>I charm you, by my once commended beauty,</p>

<p>By all your vows of love, and that great vow</p>

<p>Which did incorporate and make us one,</p>

<p>That you unfold to me, your self, your half,</p>

<p>Why you are heavy, and what men tonight</p>

<p>Have had resort to you; for here have been</p>

<p>Some six or seven who did hide their faces</p>

<p>Even from darkness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Kneel not, gentle Portia.</p>

<p><center><i>[He lifts her up.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.</p>

<p>Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,</p>

<p>Is it excepted I should know no secrets</p>

<p>That appertain to you? Am I your self</p>

<p>But, as it were, in sort or limitation,</p>

<p>To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,</p>

<p>And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the</p>

<p>suburbs</p>

<p>Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,</p>

<p>Portia is Brutus’ harlot, not his wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>You are my true and honorable wife,</p>

<p>As dear to me as are the ruddy drops</p>

<p>That visit my sad heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>If this were true, then should I know this secret.</p>

<p>I grant I am a woman, but withal</p>

<p>A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.</p>

<p>I grant I am a woman, but withal</p>

<p>A woman well-reputed, Cato’s daughter.</p>

<p>Think you I am no stronger than my sex,</p>

<p>Being so fathered and so husbanded?</p>

<p>Tell me your counsels; I will not disclose ’em.</p>

<p>I have made strong proof of my constancy,</p>

<p>Giving myself a voluntary wound</p>

<p>Here, in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience,</p>

<p>And not my husband’s secrets?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  O you gods,</p>

<p>Render me worthy of this noble wife!     <i><i>[Knock.]</i></i></p>

<p>Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,</p>

<p>And by and by thy bosom shall partake</p>

<p>The secrets of my heart.</p>

<p>All my engagements I will construe to thee,</p>

<p>All the charactery of my sad brows.</p>

<p>Leave me with haste.     <i><i>[Portia exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Lucius, who ’s that knocks?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius and Ligarius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucius</sc></p>

<p>Here is a sick man that would speak with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spoke of.–</p>

<p>Boy, stand aside.     <i><i>[Lucius exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Caius Ligarius, how?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ligarius</sc></p>

<p>Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,</p>

<p>To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ligarius</sc></p>

<p>I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand</p>

<p>Any exploit worthy the name of honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,</p>

<p>Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ligarius</sc></p>

<p>By all the gods that Romans bow before,</p>

<p>I here discard my sickness.</p>

<p><center><i>[He takes off his kerchief.]</i></center></p>

<p>Soul of Rome,</p>

<p>Brave son derived from honorable loins,</p>

<p>Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up</p>

<p>My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,</p>

<p>And I will strive with things impossible,</p>

<p>Yea, get the better of them. What’s to do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>A piece of work that will make sick men whole.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ligarius</sc></p>

<p>But are not some whole that we must make sick?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>That must we also. What it is, my Caius,</p>

<p>I shall unfold to thee as we are going</p>

<p>To whom it must be done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ligarius</sc>  Set on your foot,</p>

<p>And with a heart new-fired I follow you</p>

<p>To do I know not what; but it sufficeth</p>

<p>That Brutus leads me on.     <i><i>[Thunder.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Follow me then.</p>
