<p><center><i>[Enter Brutus and Cassius with the Plebeians.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc></p>

<p>We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Then follow me and give me audience, friends.–</p>

<p>Cassius, go you into the other street</p>

<p>And part the numbers.–</p>

<p>Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here;</p>

<p>Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;</p>

<p>And public reasons shall be rendered</p>

<p>Of Caesar’s death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  I will hear Brutus speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons</p>

<p>When severally we hear them rendered.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians.</p>

<p>Brutus goes into the pulpit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Be patient till the last.</p>

<p>Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my</p>

<p>cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me</p>

<p>for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor</p>

<p>that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom,</p>

<p>and awake your senses that you may the better</p>

<p>judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear</p>

<p>friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love</p>

<p>to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend</p>

<p>demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my</p>

<p>answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved</p>

<p>Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and</p>

<p>die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all</p>

<p>freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he</p>

<p>was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I</p>

<p>honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him.</p>

<p>There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor</p>

<p>for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is</p>

<p>here so base that would be a bondman? If any,</p>

<p>speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude</p>

<p>that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him</p>

<p>have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not</p>

<p>love his country? If any, speak, for him have I</p>

<p>offended. I pause for a reply.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc>  None, Brutus, none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc>  Then none have I offended. I have done no</p>

<p>more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The</p>

<p>question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his</p>

<p>glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor</p>

<p>his offenses enforced for which he suffered death.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony,</p>

<p>who, though he had no hand in his death, shall</p>

<p>receive the benefit of his dying–a place in the</p>

<p>commonwealth–as which of you shall not? With</p>

<p>this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the</p>

<p>good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself</p>

<p>when it shall please my country to need my death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc>  Live, Brutus, live, live!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Bring him with triumph home unto his house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Give him a statue with his ancestors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Let him be Caesar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  Caesar’s better parts</p>

<p>Shall be crowned in Brutus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and</p>

<p>clamors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>My countrymen–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  Peace, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brutus</sc></p>

<p>Good countrymen, let me depart alone,</p>

<p>And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.</p>

<p>Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech</p>

<p>Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony</p>

<p>(By our permission) is allowed to make.</p>

<p>I do entreat you, not a man depart,</p>

<p>Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.</p>

<p><center><i>[He descends and exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Let him go up into the public chair.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc></p>

<p>We’ll hear him.–Noble Antony, go up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He goes into the pulpit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  What does he say of Brutus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  He says for Brutus’ sake</p>

<p>He finds himself beholding to us all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>This Caesar was a tyrant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  Nay, that’s certain.</p>

<p>We are blest that Rome is rid of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Peace, let us hear what Antony can say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>You gentle Romans–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc>  Peace, ho! Let us hear him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.</p>

<p>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</p>

<p>The evil that men do lives after them;</p>

<p>The good is oft interred with their bones.</p>

<p>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</p>

<p>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.</p>

<p>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</p>

<p>And grievously hath Caesar answered it.</p>

<p>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest</p>

<p>(For Brutus is an honorable man;</p>

<p>So are they all, all honorable men),</p>

<p>Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.</p>

<p>He was my friend, faithful and just to me,</p>

<p>But Brutus says he was ambitious,</p>

<p>And Brutus is an honorable man.</p>

<p>He hath brought many captives home to Rome,</p>

<p>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.</p>

<p>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</p>

<p>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;</p>

<p>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.</p>

<p>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,</p>

<p>And Brutus is an honorable man.</p>

<p>You all did see that on the Lupercal</p>

<p>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</p>

<p>Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?</p>

<p>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,</p>

<p>And sure he is an honorable man.</p>

<p>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</p>

<p>But here I am to speak what I do know.</p>

<p>You all did love him once, not without cause.</p>

<p>What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for</p>

<p>him?–</p>

<p>O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,</p>

<p>And men have lost their reason!–Bear with me;</p>

<p>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</p>

<p>And I must pause till it come back to me.     <i><i>[He weeps.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>If thou consider rightly of the matter,</p>

<p>Caesar has had great wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  Has he, masters?</p>

<p>I fear there will a worse come in his place.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Marked you his words? He would not take the</p>

<p>crown;</p>

<p>Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>If it be found so, some will dear abide it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Now mark him. He begins again to speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>But yesterday the word of Caesar might</p>

<p>Have stood against the world. Now lies he there,</p>

<p>And none so poor to do him reverence.</p>

<p>O masters, if I were disposed to stir</p>

<p>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</p>

<p>I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,</p>

<p>Who, you all know, are honorable men.</p>

<p>I will not do them wrong. I rather choose</p>

<p>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</p>

<p>Than I will wrong such honorable men.</p>

<p>But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar.</p>

<p>I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will.</p>

<p>Let but the commons hear this testament,</p>

<p>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,</p>

<p>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds</p>

<p>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood–</p>

<p>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory</p>

<p>And, dying, mention it within their wills,</p>

<p>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</p>

<p>Unto their issue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc></p>

<p>The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it.</p>

<p>It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.</p>

<p>You are not wood, you are not stones, but men.</p>

<p>And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,</p>

<p>It will inflame you; it will make you mad.</p>

<p>’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,</p>

<p>For if you should, O, what would come of it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc></p>

<p>You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?</p>

<p>I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it.</p>

<p>I fear I wrong the honorable men</p>

<p>Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  They were traitors. Honorable men?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc>  The will! The testament!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  They were villains, murderers. The</p>

<p>will! Read the will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>You will compel me, then, to read the will?</p>

<p>Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,</p>

<p>And let me show you him that made the will.</p>

<p>Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc>  Come down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  Descend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  You shall have leave.</p>

<p><center><i>[Antony descends.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  A ring; stand round.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Room for Antony, most noble Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc>  Stand back! Room! Bear back!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.</p>

<p>You all do know this mantle. I remember</p>

<p>The first time ever Caesar put it on.</p>

<p>’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent,</p>

<p>That day he overcame the Nervii.</p>

<p>Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through.</p>

<p>See what a rent the envious Casca made.</p>

<p>Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabbed,</p>

<p>And, as he plucked his cursed steel away,</p>

<p>Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,</p>

<p>As rushing out of doors to be resolved</p>

<p>If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no;</p>

<p>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.</p>

<p>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</p>

<p>This was the most unkindest cut of all.</p>

<p>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</p>

<p>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,</p>

<p>Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart,</p>

<p>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</p>

<p>Even at the base of Pompey’s statue</p>

<p>(Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell.</p>

<p>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</p>

<p>Then I and you and all of us fell down,</p>

<p>Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.</p>

<p>O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel</p>

<p>The dint of pity. These are gracious drops.</p>

<p>Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold</p>

<p>Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here,</p>

<p><center><i>[Antony lifts Caesar’s cloak.]</i></center></p>

<p>Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  O piteous spectacle!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  O noble Caesar!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  O woeful day!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  O traitors, villains!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  O most bloody sight!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  We will be revenged.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc>  Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!</p>

<p>Slay! Let not a traitor live!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Stay, countrymen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him,</p>

<p>we’ll die with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up</p>

<p>To such a sudden flood of mutiny.</p>

<p>They that have done this deed are honorable.</p>

<p>What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,</p>

<p>That made them do it. They are wise and honorable</p>

<p>And will no doubt with reasons answer you.</p>

<p>I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.</p>

<p>I am no orator, as Brutus is,</p>

<p>But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man</p>

<p>That love my friend, and that they know full well</p>

<p>That gave me public leave to speak of him.</p>

<p>For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,</p>

<p>Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech</p>

<p>To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on.</p>

<p>I tell you that which you yourselves do know,</p>

<p>Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb</p>

<p>mouths,</p>

<p>And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,</p>

<p>And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony</p>

<p>Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue</p>

<p>In every wound of Caesar that should move</p>

<p>The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc></p>

<p>We’ll mutiny.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  We’ll burn the house of Brutus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Away then. Come, seek the conspirators.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc></p>

<p>Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.</p>

<p>Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?</p>

<p>Alas, you know not. I must tell you then.</p>

<p>You have forgot the will I told you of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc></p>

<p>Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal:</p>

<p>To every Roman citizen he gives,</p>

<p>To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  O royal Caesar!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Hear me with patience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Plebeians</sc>  Peace, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,</p>

<p>His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,</p>

<p>On this side Tiber. He hath left them you,</p>

<p>And to your heirs forever–common pleasures</p>

<p>To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.</p>

<p>Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc></p>

<p>Never, never!–Come, away, away!</p>

<p>We’ll burn his body in the holy place</p>

<p>And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses.</p>

<p>Take up the body.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  Go fetch fire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  Pluck down benches.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fourth</sc> <sc>Plebeian</sc>  Pluck down forms, windows,</p>

<p>anything.</p>

<p><center><i>[Plebeians exit with Caesar’s body.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot;</p>

<p>Take thou what course thou wilt.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, fellow?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc>  Where is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>And thither will I straight to visit him.</p>

<p>He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry</p>

<p>And in this mood will give us anything.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>I heard him say Brutus and Cassius</p>

<p>Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antony</sc></p>

<p>Belike they had some notice of the people</p>

<p>How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.</p>
