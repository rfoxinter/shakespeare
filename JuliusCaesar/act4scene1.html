<p><center><i>[Enter Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>These many, then, shall die; their names are</p>

<p>pricked.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span></p>

<p>Your brother too must die. Consent you, Lepidus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lepidus</span></p>

<p>I do consent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span>  Prick him down, Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lepidus</span></p>

<p>Upon condition Publius shall not live,</p>

<p>Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.</p>

<p>But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar’s house;</p>

<p>Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine</p>

<p>How to cut off some charge in legacies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lepidus</span>  What, shall I find you here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span>  Or here, or at the Capitol.     <i><i>[Lepidus exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>This is a slight, unmeritable man,</p>

<p>Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,</p>

<p>The threefold world divided, he should stand</p>

<p>One of the three to share it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span>  So you thought him</p>

<p>And took his voice who should be pricked to die</p>

<p>In our black sentence and proscription.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>Octavius, I have seen more days than you,</p>

<p>And, though we lay these honors on this man</p>

<p>To ease ourselves of diverse sland’rous loads,</p>

<p>He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,</p>

<p>To groan and sweat under the business,</p>

<p>Either led or driven, as we point the way;</p>

<p>And having brought our treasure where we will,</p>

<p>Then take we down his load and turn him off</p>

<p>(Like to the empty ass) to shake his ears</p>

<p>And graze in commons.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span>  You may do your will,</p>

<p>But he’s a tried and valiant soldier.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>So is my horse, Octavius, and for that</p>

<p>I do appoint him store of provender.</p>

<p>It is a creature that I teach to fight,</p>

<p>To wind, to stop, to run directly on,</p>

<p>His corporal motion governed by my spirit;</p>

<p>And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so.</p>

<p>He must be taught and trained and bid go forth–</p>

<p>A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds</p>

<p>On objects, arts, and imitations</p>

<p>Which, out of use and staled by other men,</p>

<p>Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him</p>

<p>But as a property. And now, Octavius,</p>

<p>Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius</p>

<p>Are levying powers. We must straight make head.</p>

<p>Therefore let our alliance be combined,</p>

<p>Our best friends made, our means stretched;</p>

<p>And let us presently go sit in council</p>

<p>How covert matters may be best disclosed</p>

<p>And open perils surest answered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span></p>

<p>Let us do so, for we are at the stake</p>

<p>And bayed about with many enemies,</p>

<p>And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,</p>

<p>Millions of mischiefs.</p>
