<p><center><i>[Thunder and lightning. Enter Casca and Cicero.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cicero</sc></p>

<p>Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?</p>

<p>Why are you breathless? And why stare you so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth</p>

<p>Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,</p>

<p>I have seen tempests when the scolding winds</p>

<p>Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen</p>

<p>Th’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam</p>

<p>To be exalted with the threat’ning clouds;</p>

<p>But never till tonight, never till now,</p>

<p>Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.</p>

<p>Either there is a civil strife in heaven,</p>

<p>Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,</p>

<p>Incenses them to send destruction.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cicero</sc></p>

<p>Why, saw you anything more wonderful?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>A common slave (you know him well by sight)</p>

<p>Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn</p>

<p>Like twenty torches joined; and yet his hand,</p>

<p>Not sensible of fire, remained unscorched.</p>

<p>Besides (I ha’ not since put up my sword),</p>

<p>Against the Capitol I met a lion,</p>

<p>Who glazed upon me and went surly by</p>

<p>Without annoying me. And there were drawn</p>

<p>Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,</p>

<p>Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw</p>

<p>Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.</p>

<p>And yesterday the bird of night did sit</p>

<p>Even at noonday upon the marketplace,</p>

<p>Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies</p>

<p>Do so conjointly meet, let not men say</p>

<p>“These are their reasons, they are natural,”</p>

<p>For I believe they are portentous things</p>

<p>Unto the climate that they point upon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cicero</sc></p>

<p>Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.</p>

<p>But men may construe things after their fashion,</p>

<p>Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.</p>

<p>Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>He doth, for he did bid Antonius</p>

<p>Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cicero</sc></p>

<p>Good night then, Casca. This disturbed sky</p>

<p>Is not to walk in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  Farewell, Cicero     <i><i>[Cicero exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cassius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  A Roman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  Casca, by your voice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>A very pleasing night to honest men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Those that have known the Earth so full of faults.</p>

<p>For my part, I have walked about the streets,</p>

<p>Submitting me unto the perilous night,</p>

<p>And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</p>

<p>Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;</p>

<p>And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open</p>

<p>The breast of heaven, I did present myself</p>

<p>Even in the aim and very flash of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?</p>

<p>It is the part of men to fear and tremble</p>

<p>When the most mighty gods by tokens send</p>

<p>Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life</p>

<p>That should be in a Roman you do want,</p>

<p>Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze,</p>

<p>And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder,</p>

<p>To see the strange impatience of the heavens.</p>

<p>But if you would consider the true cause</p>

<p>Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,</p>

<p>Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,</p>

<p>Why old men, fools, and children calculate,</p>

<p>Why all these things change from their ordinance,</p>

<p>Their natures, and preformed faculties,</p>

<p>To monstrous quality–why, you shall find</p>

<p>That heaven hath infused them with these spirits</p>

<p>To make them instruments of fear and warning</p>

<p>Unto some monstrous state.</p>

<p>Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</p>

<p>Most like this dreadful night,</p>

<p>That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars</p>

<p>As doth the lion in the Capitol;</p>

<p>A man no mightier than thyself or me</p>

<p>In personal action, yet prodigious grown,</p>

<p>And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>’Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Let it be who it is. For Romans now</p>

<p>Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.</p>

<p>But, woe the while, our fathers’ minds are dead,</p>

<p>And we are governed with our mothers’ spirits.</p>

<p>Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>Indeed, they say the Senators tomorrow</p>

<p>Mean to establish Caesar as a king,</p>

<p>And he shall wear his crown by sea and land</p>

<p>In every place save here in Italy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>I know where I will wear this dagger then;</p>

<p>Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.</p>

<p>Therein, you gods, you make the weak most strong;</p>

<p>Therein, you gods, you tyrants do defeat.</p>

<p>Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</p>

<p>Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,</p>

<p>Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</p>

<p>But life, being weary of these worldly bars,</p>

<p>Never lacks power to dismiss itself.</p>

<p>If I know this, know all the world besides,</p>

<p>That part of tyranny that I do bear</p>

<p>I can shake off at pleasure.     <i><i>[Thunder still.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc>  So can I.</p>

<p>So every bondman in his own hand bears</p>

<p>The power to cancel his captivity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>And why should Caesar be a tyrant, then?</p>

<p>Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf</p>

<p>But that he sees the Romans are but sheep;</p>

<p>He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.</p>

<p>Those that with haste will make a mighty fire</p>

<p>Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,</p>

<p>What rubbish, and what offal when it serves</p>

<p>For the base matter to illuminate</p>

<p>So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,</p>

<p>Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this</p>

<p>Before a willing bondman; then, I know</p>

<p>My answer must be made. But I am armed,</p>

<p>And dangers are to me indifferent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>You speak to Casca, and to such a man</p>

<p>That is no fleering telltale. Hold. My hand.</p>

<p><center><i>[They shake hands.]</i></center></p>

<p>Be factious for redress of all these griefs,</p>

<p>And I will set this foot of mine as far</p>

<p>As who goes farthest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  There’s a bargain made.</p>

<p>Now know you, Casca, I have moved already</p>

<p>Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans</p>

<p>To undergo with me an enterprise</p>

<p>Of honorable-dangerous consequence.</p>

<p>And I do know by this they stay for me</p>

<p>In Pompey’s Porch. For now, this fearful night,</p>

<p>There is no stir or walking in the streets;</p>

<p>And the complexion of the element</p>

<p>In favor ’s like the work we have in hand,</p>

<p>Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cinna.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>’Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait.</p>

<p>He is a friend.–Cinna, where haste you so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cinna</sc></p>

<p>To find out you. Who’s that? Metellus Cimber?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>No, it is Casca, one incorporate</p>

<p>To our attempts. Am I not stayed for, Cinna?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cinna</sc></p>

<p>I am glad on ’t. What a fearful night is this!</p>

<p>There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc>  Am I not stayed for? Tell me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cinna</sc></p>

<p>Yes, you are. O Cassius, if you could</p>

<p>But win the noble Brutus to our party–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc> <i>[handing him papers]</i></p>

<p>Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,</p>

<p>And look you lay it in the Praetor’s chair,</p>

<p>Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this</p>

<p>In at his window; set this up with wax</p>

<p>Upon old Brutus’ statue. All this done,</p>

<p>Repair to Pompey’s Porch, where you shall find us.</p>

<p>Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cinna</sc></p>

<p>All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone</p>

<p>To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie</p>

<p>And so bestow these papers as you bade me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>That done, repair to Pompey’s Theater.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cinna exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day</p>

<p>See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him</p>

<p>Is ours already, and the man entire</p>

<p>Upon the next encounter yields him ours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Casca</sc></p>

<p>O, he sits high in all the people’s hearts,</p>

<p>And that which would appear offense in us</p>

<p>His countenance, like richest alchemy,</p>

<p>Will change to virtue and to worthiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassius</sc></p>

<p>Him and his worth and our great need of him</p>

<p>You have right well conceited. Let us go,</p>

<p>For it is after midnight, and ere day</p>

<p>We will awake him and be sure of him.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
