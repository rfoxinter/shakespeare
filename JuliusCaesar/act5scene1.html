<p><center><i>[Enter Octavius, Antony, and their army.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span></p>

<p>Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.</p>

<p>You said the enemy would not come down</p>

<p>But keep the hills and upper regions.</p>

<p>It proves not so; their battles are at hand.</p>

<p>They mean to warn us at Philippi here,</p>

<p>Answering before we do demand of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know</p>

<p>Wherefore they do it. They could be content</p>

<p>To visit other places, and come down</p>

<p>With fearful bravery, thinking by this face</p>

<p>To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage.</p>

<p>But ’tis not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Prepare you, generals.</p>

<p>The enemy comes on in gallant show.</p>

<p>Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,</p>

<p>And something to be done immediately.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>Octavius, lead your battle softly on</p>

<p>Upon the left hand of the even field.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span></p>

<p>Upon the right hand, I; keep thou the left.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>Why do you cross me in this exigent?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span></p>

<p>I do not cross you, but I will do so.     <i><i>[March.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, and their army including</p>

<p>Lucilius, Titinius, and Messala.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  They stand and would have parley.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Stand fast, Titinius. We must out and talk.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span></p>

<p>Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.</p>

<p>Make forth. The Generals would have some words.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span> <i>[to his Officers]</i>  Stir not until the signal.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Generals step forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Words before blows; is it so, countrymen?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span></p>

<p>Not that we love words better, as you do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.</p>

<p>Witness the hole you made in Caesar’s heart,</p>

<p>Crying “Long live, hail, Caesar!”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Antony,</p>

<p>The posture of your blows are yet unknown,</p>

<p>But, for your words, they rob the Hybla bees</p>

<p>And leave them honeyless.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span>  Not stingless too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  O yes, and soundless too,</p>

<p>For you have stolen their buzzing, Antony,</p>

<p>And very wisely threat before you sting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers</p>

<p>Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar.</p>

<p>You showed your teeth like apes and fawned like</p>

<p>hounds</p>

<p>And bowed like bondmen, kissing Caesar’s feet,</p>

<p>Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind</p>

<p>Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Flatterers?–Now, Brutus, thank yourself!</p>

<p>This tongue had not offended so today</p>

<p>If Cassius might have ruled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span></p>

<p>Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,</p>

<p>The proof of it will turn to redder drops.</p>

<p>Look, I draw a sword against conspirators;</p>

<p><center><i>[He draws.]</i></center></p>

<p>When think you that the sword goes up again?</p>

<p>Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds</p>

<p>Be well avenged, or till another Caesar</p>

<p>Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands</p>

<p>Unless thou bring’st them with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span>  So I hope.</p>

<p>I was not born to die on Brutus’ sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,</p>

<p>Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor,</p>

<p>Joined with a masker and a reveler!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antony</span></p>

<p>Old Cassius still.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Octavius</span>  Come, Antony, away!–</p>

<p>Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.</p>

<p>If you dare fight today, come to the field;</p>

<p>If not, when you have stomachs.</p>

<p><center><i>[Octavius, Antony, and their army exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!</p>

<p>The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Ho, Lucilius, hark, a word with you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lucilius and Messala stand forth.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucilius</span>  My lord?</p>

<p><center><i>[Brutus and Lucilius step aside together.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Messala.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messala</span>  What says my general?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Messala,</p>

<p>This is my birthday, as this very day</p>

<p>Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.</p>

<p>Be thou my witness that against my will</p>

<p>(As Pompey was) am I compelled to set</p>

<p>Upon one battle all our liberties.</p>

<p>You know that I held Epicurus strong</p>

<p>And his opinion. Now I change my mind</p>

<p>And partly credit things that do presage.</p>

<p>Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</p>

<p>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched,</p>

<p>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands,</p>

<p>Who to Philippi here consorted us.</p>

<p>This morning are they fled away and gone,</p>

<p>And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites</p>

<p>Fly o’er our heads and downward look on us</p>

<p>As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem</p>

<p>A canopy most fatal, under which</p>

<p>Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messala</span></p>

<p>Believe not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  I but believe it partly,</p>

<p>For I am fresh of spirit and resolved</p>

<p>To meet all perils very constantly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Even so, Lucilius.     <i><i>[Brutus returns to Cassius.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Now, most noble Brutus,</p>

<p>The gods today stand friendly that we may,</p>

<p>Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age.</p>

<p>But since the affairs of men rests still incertain,</p>

<p>Let’s reason with the worst that may befall.</p>

<p>If we do lose this battle, then is this</p>

<p>The very last time we shall speak together.</p>

<p>What are you then determined to do?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Even by the rule of that philosophy</p>

<p>By which I did blame Cato for the death</p>

<p>Which he did give himself (I know not how,</p>

<p>But I do find it cowardly and vile,</p>

<p>For fear of what might fall, so to prevent</p>

<p>The time of life), arming myself with patience</p>

<p>To stay the providence of some high powers</p>

<p>That govern us below.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Then, if we lose this battle,</p>

<p>You are contented to be led in triumph</p>

<p>Thorough the streets of Rome?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,</p>

<p>That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome.</p>

<p>He bears too great a mind. But this same day</p>

<p>Must end that work the ides of March begun.</p>

<p>And whether we shall meet again, I know not.</p>

<p>Therefore our everlasting farewell take.</p>

<p>Forever and forever farewell, Cassius.</p>

<p>If we do meet again, why we shall smile;</p>

<p>If not, why then this parting was well made.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.</p>

<p>If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed;</p>

<p>If not, ’tis true this parting was well made.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Why then, lead on.–O, that a man might know</p>

<p>The end of this day’s business ere it come!</p>

<p>But it sufficeth that the day will end,</p>

<p>And then the end is known.–Come ho, away!</p>
