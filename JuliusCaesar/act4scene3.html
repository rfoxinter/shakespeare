<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>That you have wronged me doth appear in this:</p>

<p>You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella</p>

<p>For taking bribes here of the Sardians,</p>

<p>Wherein my letters, praying on his side</p>

<p>Because I knew the man, was slighted off.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>You wronged yourself to write in such a case.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>In such a time as this it is not meet</p>

<p>That every nice offense should bear his comment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself</p>

<p>Are much condemned to have an itching palm,</p>

<p>To sell and mart your offices for gold</p>

<p>To undeservers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  I an itching palm?</p>

<p>You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,</p>

<p>Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>The name of Cassius honors this corruption,</p>

<p>And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Chastisement?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Remember March; the ides of March remember.</p>

<p>Did not great Julius bleed for justice’ sake?</p>

<p>What villain touched his body that did stab</p>

<p>And not for justice? What, shall one of us</p>

<p>That struck the foremost man of all this world</p>

<p>But for supporting robbers, shall we now</p>

<p>Contaminate our fingers with base bribes</p>

<p>And sell the mighty space of our large honors</p>

<p>For so much trash as may be grasped thus?</p>

<p>I had rather be a dog and bay the moon</p>

<p>Than such a Roman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Brutus, bait not me.</p>

<p>I’ll not endure it. You forget yourself</p>

<p>To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,</p>

<p>Older in practice, abler than yourself</p>

<p>To make conditions.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Go to! You are not, Cassius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  I say you are not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Urge me no more. I shall forget myself.</p>

<p>Have mind upon your health. Tempt me no farther.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Away, slight man!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Is ’t possible?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Hear me, for I will speak.</p>

<p>Must I give way and room to your rash choler?</p>

<p>Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>O you gods, you gods, must I endure all this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.</p>

<p>Go show your slaves how choleric you are</p>

<p>And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?</p>

<p>Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch</p>

<p>Under your testy humor? By the gods,</p>

<p>You shall digest the venom of your spleen</p>

<p>Though it do split you. For, from this day forth,</p>

<p>I’ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,</p>

<p>When you are waspish.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Is it come to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>You say you are a better soldier.</p>

<p>Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,</p>

<p>And it shall please me well. For mine own part,</p>

<p>I shall be glad to learn of noble men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.</p>

<p>I said an elder soldier, not a better.</p>

<p>Did I say “better”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  If you did, I care not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved</p>

<p>me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  I durst not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>What? Durst not tempt him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  For your life you durst</p>

<p>not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Do not presume too much upon my love.</p>

<p>I may do that I shall be sorry for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>You have done that you should be sorry for.</p>

<p>There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,</p>

<p>For I am armed so strong in honesty</p>

<p>That they pass by me as the idle wind,</p>

<p>Which I respect not. I did send to you</p>

<p>For certain sums of gold, which you denied me,</p>

<p>For I can raise no money by vile means.</p>

<p>By heaven, I had rather coin my heart</p>

<p>And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring</p>

<p>From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash</p>

<p>By any indirection. I did send</p>

<p>To you for gold to pay my legions,</p>

<p>Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?</p>

<p>Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?</p>

<p>When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous</p>

<p>To lock such rascal counters from his friends,</p>

<p>Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;</p>

<p>Dash him to pieces!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  I denied you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  You did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>I did not. He was but a fool that brought</p>

<p>My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart.</p>

<p>A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities,</p>

<p>But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>I do not, till you practice them on me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>You love me not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  I do not like your faults.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>A friendly eye could never see such faults.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>A flatterer’s would not, though they do appear</p>

<p>As huge as high Olympus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come!</p>

<p>Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,</p>

<p>For Cassius is aweary of the world–</p>

<p>Hated by one he loves, braved by his brother,</p>

<p>Checked like a bondman, all his faults observed,</p>

<p>Set in a notebook, learned and conned by rote</p>

<p>To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep</p>

<p>My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,</p>

<p><center><i>[Offering his dagger to Brutus.]</i></center></p>

<p>And here my naked breast; within, a heart</p>

<p>Dearer than Pluto’s mine, richer than gold.</p>

<p>If that thou be’st a Roman, take it forth.</p>

<p>I that denied thee gold will give my heart.</p>

<p>Strike as thou didst at Caesar, for I know</p>

<p>When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him</p>

<p>better</p>

<p>Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Sheathe your</p>

<p>dagger.</p>

<p>Be angry when you will, it shall have scope.</p>

<p>Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.</p>

<p>O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb</p>

<p>That carries anger as the flint bears fire,</p>

<p>Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark</p>

<p>And straight is cold again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Hath Cassius lived</p>

<p>To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus</p>

<p>When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>And my heart too.     <i><i>[They clasp hands.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  O Brutus!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Have not you love enough to bear with me</p>

<p>When that rash humor which my mother gave me</p>

<p>Makes me forgetful?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Yes, Cassius, and from</p>

<p>henceforth</p>

<p>When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,</p>

<p>He’ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Poet followed by Lucilius, Titinius, and Lucius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poet</span></p>

<p>Let me go in to see the Generals.</p>

<p>There is some grudge between ’em; ’tis not meet</p>

<p>They be alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucilius</span>  You shall not come to them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poet</span>  Nothing but death shall stay me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  How now, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Poet</span></p>

<p>For shame, you generals, what do you mean?</p>

<p>Love and be friends as two such men should be,</p>

<p>For I have seen more years, I’m sure, than ye.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Ha, ha, how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Get you hence, sirrah! Saucy fellow, hence!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Bear with him, Brutus. ’Tis his fashion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>I’ll know his humor when he knows his time.</p>

<p>What should the wars do with these jigging fools?–</p>

<p>Companion, hence!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Away, away, be gone!     <i><i>[Poet exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders</p>

<p>Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you</p>

<p>Immediately to us.     <i><i>[Lucilius and Titinius exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Lucius, a bowl of wine.     <i><i>[Lucius exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>I did not think you could have been so angry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Of your philosophy you make no use</p>

<p>If you give place to accidental evils.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Ha? Portia?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  She is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>How ’scaped I killing when I crossed you so?</p>

<p>O insupportable and touching loss!</p>

<p>Upon what sickness?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Impatient of my absence,</p>

<p>And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony</p>

<p>Have made themselves so strong–for with her</p>

<p>death</p>

<p>That tidings came–with this she fell distract</p>

<p>And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  And died so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Even so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  O you immortal gods!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius with wine and tapers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Speak no more of her.–Give me a bowl of wine.–</p>

<p>In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.     <i><i>[He drinks.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.–</p>

<p>Fill, Lucius, till the wine o’erswell the cup;</p>

<p>I cannot drink too much of Brutus’ love.     <i><i>[He drinks.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[Lucius exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Titinius and Messala.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Come in, Titinius. Welcome, good Messala.</p>

<p>Now sit we close about this taper here,</p>

<p>And call in question our necessities.     <i><i>[They sit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Portia, art thou gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  No more, I pray you.–</p>

<p>Messala, I have here received letters</p>

<p>That young Octavius and Mark Antony</p>

<p>Come down upon us with a mighty power,</p>

<p>Bending their expedition toward Philippi.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messala</span></p>

<p>Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  With what addition?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messala</span></p>

<p>That by proscription and bills of outlawry,</p>

<p>Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus</p>

<p>Have put to death an hundred senators.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Therein our letters do not well agree.</p>

<p>Mine speak of seventy senators that died</p>

<p>By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>Cicero one?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messala</span>  Cicero is dead,</p>

<p>And by that order of proscription.</p>

<p>Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  No, Messala.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messala</span></p>

<p>Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?</p>

<br/>

<p>BRUTUSNothing, Messala.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messala</span>  That methinks is strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messala</span>  No, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messala</span></p>

<p>Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell,</p>

<p>For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.</p>

<p>With meditating that she must die once,</p>

<p>I have the patience to endure it now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messala</span></p>

<p>Even so great men great losses should endure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span></p>

<p>I have as much of this in art as you,</p>

<p>But yet my nature could not bear it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Well, to our work alive. What do you think</p>

<p>Of marching to Philippi presently?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  I do not think it good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Your reason?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  This it is:</p>

<p>’Tis better that the enemy seek us;</p>

<p>So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,</p>

<p>Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still,</p>

<p>Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Good reasons must of force give place to better.</p>

<p>The people ’twixt Philippi and this ground</p>

<p>Do stand but in a forced affection,</p>

<p>For they have grudged us contribution.</p>

<p>The enemy, marching along by them,</p>

<p>By them shall make a fuller number up,</p>

<p>Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged,</p>

<p>From which advantage shall we cut him off</p>

<p>If at Philippi we do face him there,</p>

<p>These people at our back.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Hear me, good brother–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Under your pardon. You must note besides</p>

<p>That we have tried the utmost of our friends,</p>

<p>Our legions are brim full, our cause is ripe.</p>

<p>The enemy increaseth every day;</p>

<p>We, at the height, are ready to decline.</p>

<p>There is a tide in the affairs of men</p>

<p>Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;</p>

<p>Omitted, all the voyage of their life</p>

<p>Is bound in shallows and in miseries.</p>

<p>On such a full sea are we now afloat,</p>

<p>And we must take the current when it serves</p>

<p>Or lose our ventures.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Then, with your will, go on;</p>

<p>We’ll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>The deep of night is crept upon our talk,</p>

<p>And nature must obey necessity,</p>

<p>Which we will niggard with a little rest.</p>

<p>There is no more to say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  No more. Good night.</p>

<p><center><i>[They stand.]</i></center></p>

<p>Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Lucius.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>My gown.     <i><i>[Lucius exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Farewell, good Messala.–</p>

<p>Good night, Titinius.–Noble, noble Cassius,</p>

<p>Good night and good repose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  O my dear brother,</p>

<p>This was an ill beginning of the night.</p>

<p>Never come such division ’tween our souls!</p>

<p>Let it not, Brutus.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucius with the gown.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Everything is well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassius</span>  Good night, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Good night, good brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titinius</span>/<span class='sc'>Messala</span></p>

<p>Good night, Lord Brutus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Farewell, everyone.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Brutus and Lucius exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Here in the tent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  What, thou speak’st drowsily?</p>

<p>Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o’erwatched.</p>

<p>Call Claudius and some other of my men;</p>

<p>I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  Varro and Claudius.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Varro and Claudius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro</span>  Calls my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep.</p>

<p>It may be I shall raise you by and by</p>

<p>On business to my brother Cassius.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro</span></p>

<p>So please you, we will stand and watch your</p>

<p>pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>I will not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.</p>

<p>It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.</p>

<p><center><i>[They lie down.]</i></center></p>

<p>Look, Lucius, here’s the book I sought for so.</p>

<p>I put it in the pocket of my gown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>I was sure your Lordship did not give it me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.</p>

<p>Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile</p>

<p>And touch thy instrument a strain or two?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>Ay, my lord, an ’t please you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  It does, my boy.</p>

<p>I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  It is my duty, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>I should not urge thy duty past thy might.</p>

<p>I know young bloods look for a time of rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  I have slept, my lord, already.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again.</p>

<p>I will not hold thee long. If I do live,</p>

<p>I will be good to thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[Music and a song. Lucius then falls asleep.]</i></center></p>

<p>This is a sleepy tune. O murd’rous slumber,</p>

<p>Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,</p>

<p>That plays thee music?–Gentle knave, good night.</p>

<p>I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.</p>

<p>If thou dost nod, thou break’st thy instrument.</p>

<p>I’ll take it from thee and, good boy, good night.</p>

<p><center><i>[He moves the instrument.]</i></center></p>

<p>Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turned down</p>

<p>Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.</p>

<p>How ill this taper burns.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Ghost of Caesar.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Ha, who comes here?–</p>

<p>I think it is the weakness of mine eyes</p>

<p>That shapes this monstrous apparition.</p>

<p>It comes upon me.–Art thou any thing?</p>

<p>Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,</p>

<p>That mak’st my blood cold and my hair to stare?</p>

<p>Speak to me what thou art.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ghost</span></p>

<p>Thy evil spirit, Brutus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Why com’st thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ghost</span></p>

<p>To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Well, then I shall see thee again?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ghost</span>  Ay, at Philippi.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.     <i><i>[Ghost exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Now I have taken heart, thou vanishest.</p>

<p>Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.–</p>

<p>Boy, Lucius!–Varro, Claudius, sirs, awake!</p>

<p>Claudius!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  The strings, my lord, are false.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>He thinks he still is at his instrument.</p>

<p>Lucius, awake!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  My lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span></p>

<p>My lord, I do not know that I did cry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucius</span>  Nothing, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Sleep again, Lucius.–Sirrah Claudius!</p>

<p><center><i>[To Varro.]</i></center> Fellow thou, awake!     <i><center><i>[They rise up.]</i></center></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro</span>  My lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudius</span>  My lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span></p>

<p>Did we, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span>  Ay. Saw you anything?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Varro</span>  No, my lord, I saw nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudius</span>  Nor I, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brutus</span></p>

<p>Go and commend me to my brother Cassius.</p>

<p>Bid him set on his powers betimes before,</p>

<p>And we will follow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Both</span>  It shall be done, my lord.</p>
