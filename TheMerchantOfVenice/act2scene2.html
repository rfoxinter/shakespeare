<p><center><i>[Enter Lancelet Gobbo the Clown, alone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Certainly my conscience will serve me to</p>

<p>run from this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine</p>

<p>elbow and tempts me, saying to me “Gobbo,</p>

<p>Lancelet Gobbo, good Lancelet,” or “good Gobbo,”</p>

<p>or “good Lancelet Gobbo, use your legs, take</p>

<p>the start, run away.” My conscience says “No. Take</p>

<p>heed, honest Lancelet, take heed, honest Gobbo,”</p>

<p>or, as aforesaid, “honest Lancelet Gobbo, do not</p>

<p>run; scorn running with thy heels.” Well, the most</p>

<p>courageous fiend bids me pack. “Fia!” says the</p>

<p>fiend. “Away!” says the fiend. “For the heavens,</p>

<p>rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run!”</p>

<p>Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my</p>

<p>heart, says very wisely to me “My honest friend</p>

<p>Lancelet, being an honest man’s son”–or rather,</p>

<p>an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did</p>

<p>something smack, something grow to–he had a</p>

<p>kind of taste–well, my conscience says “Lancelet,</p>

<p>budge not.” “Budge,” says the fiend. “Budge not,”</p>

<p>says my conscience. “Conscience,” say I, “you</p>

<p>counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.”</p>

<p>To be ruled by my conscience, I should stay with the</p>

<p>Jew my master, who (God bless the mark) is a kind</p>

<p>of devil; and to run away from the Jew, I should be</p>

<p>ruled by the fiend, who (saving your reverence) is</p>

<p>the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil</p>

<p>incarnation, and, in my conscience, my conscience</p>

<p>is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel</p>

<p>me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more</p>

<p>friendly counsel. I will run, fiend. My heels are at</p>

<p>your commandment. I will run.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter old Gobbo with a basket.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  Master young man, you, I pray you, which is</p>

<p>the way to Master Jew’s?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  O heavens, this is my true begotten</p>

<p>father, who being more than sandblind, high gravelblind,</p>

<p>knows me not. I will try confusions with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is</p>

<p>the way to Master Jew’s?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Turn up on your right hand at the next</p>

<p>turning, but at the next turning of all on your left;</p>

<p>marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand,</p>

<p>but turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  Be God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit.</p>

<p>Can you tell me whether one Lancelet, that dwells</p>

<p>with him, dwell with him or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Talk you of young Master Lancelet? <i>[Aside.]</i></p>

<p>Mark me now, now will I raise the waters.–Talk</p>

<p>you of young Master Lancelet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  No master, sir, but a poor man’s son. His</p>

<p>father, though I say ’t, is an honest exceeding poor</p>

<p>man and, God be thanked, well to live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Well, let his father be what he will, we talk</p>

<p>of young Master Lancelet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  Your Worship’s friend, and Lancelet, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech</p>

<p>you, talk you of young Master Lancelet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  Of Lancelet, an ’t please your mastership.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Ergo, Master Lancelet. Talk not of Master</p>

<p>Lancelet, father, for the young gentleman, according</p>

<p>to Fates and Destinies, and such odd sayings, the</p>

<p>Sisters Three, and such branches of learning, is</p>

<p>indeed deceased, or, as you would say in plain</p>

<p>terms, gone to heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff</p>

<p>of my age, my very prop.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post,</p>

<p>a staff or a prop?–Do you know me, father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman.</p>

<p>But I pray you tell me, is my boy, God rest his</p>

<p>soul, alive or dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Do you not know me, father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  Alack, sir, I am sandblind. I know you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might</p>

<p>fail of the knowing me. It is a wise father that</p>

<p>knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you</p>

<p>news of your son. <i>[He kneels.]</i> Give me your blessing.</p>

<p>Truth will come to light, murder cannot be hid</p>

<p>long–a man’s son may, but in the end, truth will</p>

<p>out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  Pray you, sir, stand up! I am sure you are not</p>

<p>Lancelet my boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Pray you, let’s have no more fooling about</p>

<p>it, but give me your blessing. I am Lancelet, your</p>

<p>boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall</p>

<p>be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  I cannot think you are my son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  I know not what I shall think of that; but I</p>

<p>am Lancelet, the Jew’s man, and I am sure Margery</p>

<p>your wife is my mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  Her name is Margery, indeed. I’ll be sworn if</p>

<p>thou be Lancelet, thou art mine own flesh and</p>

<p>blood. Lord worshiped might He be, what a beard</p>

<p>hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin</p>

<p>than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc> <i>[standing up]</i>  It should seem, then, that</p>

<p>Dobbin’s tail grows backward. I am sure he had</p>

<p>more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I</p>

<p>last saw him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou</p>

<p>and thy master agree? I have brought him a present.</p>

<p>How ’gree you now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Well, well. But for mine own part, as I have</p>

<p>set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I</p>

<p>have run some ground. My master’s a very Jew.</p>

<p>Give him a present! Give him a halter. I am</p>

<p>famished in his service. You may tell every finger I</p>

<p>have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come!</p>

<p>Give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who</p>

<p>indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve not him, I</p>

<p>will run as far as God has any ground. O rare</p>

<p>fortune, here comes the man! To him, father, for I</p>

<p>am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bassanio with Leonardo and a follower or two.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc> <i>[to an Attendant]</i>  You may do so, but let it be</p>

<p>so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five</p>

<p>of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the</p>

<p>liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come</p>

<p>anon to my lodging.     <i><i>[The Attendant exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  To him, father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc> <i>[to Bassanio]</i>  God bless your Worship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  Gramercy. Wouldst thou aught with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  Here’s my son, sir, a poor boy–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew’s man,</p>

<p>that would, sir, as my father shall specify–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say,</p>

<p>to serve–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the</p>

<p>Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall specify–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  His master and he (saving your Worship’s</p>

<p>reverence) are scarce cater-cousins–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew,</p>

<p>having done me wrong, doth cause me, as my</p>

<p>father being, I hope, an old man, shall frutify unto</p>

<p>you–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow</p>

<p>upon your Worship, and my suit is–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  In very brief, the suit is impertinent to</p>

<p>myself, as your Worship shall know by this honest</p>

<p>old man, and though I say it, though old man yet</p>

<p>poor man, my father–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  One speak for both. What would you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Serve you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gobbo</sc>  That is the very defect of the matter, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc> <i>[to Lancelet]</i></p>

<p>I know thee well. Thou hast obtained thy suit.</p>

<p>Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,</p>

<p>And hath preferred thee, if it be preferment</p>

<p>To leave a rich Jew’s service, to become</p>

<p>The follower of so poor a gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  The old proverb is very well parted between</p>

<p>my master Shylock and you, sir: you have “the</p>

<p>grace of God,” sir, and he hath “enough.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Thou speak’st it well.–Go, father, with thy son.–</p>

<p>Take leave of thy old master, and inquire</p>

<p>My lodging out. <i>[To an Attendant.]</i> Give him a livery</p>

<p>More guarded than his fellows’. See it done.</p>

<p><center><i>[Attendant exits. Bassanio and Leonardo talk apart.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have</p>

<p>ne’er a tongue in my head! Well, <i>[studying his palm]</i></p>

<p>if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth</p>

<p>offer to swear upon a book–I shall have good</p>

<p>fortune, go to! Here’s a simple line of life. Here’s a</p>

<p>small trifle of wives–alas, fifteen wives is nothing;</p>

<p>eleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in</p>

<p>for one man–and then to ’scape drowning</p>

<p>thrice, and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a</p>

<p>featherbed! Here are simple ’scapes. Well, if Fortune</p>

<p>be a woman, she’s a good wench for this gear.</p>

<p>Father, come. I’ll take my leave of the Jew in the</p>

<p>twinkling.     <i><i>[Lancelet and old Gobbo exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.</p>

<p><center><i>[Handing him a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>These things being bought and orderly bestowed,</p>

<p>Return in haste, for I do feast tonight</p>

<p>My best esteemed acquaintance. Hie thee, go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonardo</sc></p>

<p>My best endeavors shall be done herein.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gratiano.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc> <i>[to Leonardo]</i>  Where’s your master?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonardo</sc>  Yonder, sir, he walks.     <i><i>[Leonardo exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  Signior Bassanio!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  Gratiano!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  I have suit to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  You have obtained it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  You must not deny me. I must go with you</p>

<p>to Belmont.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano,</p>

<p>Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice–</p>

<p>Parts that become thee happily enough,</p>

<p>And in such eyes as ours appear not faults.</p>

<p>But where thou art not known–why, there they</p>

<p>show</p>

<p>Something too liberal. Pray thee take pain</p>

<p>To allay with some cold drops of modesty</p>

<p>Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior</p>

<p>I be misconstered in the place I go to,</p>

<p>And lose my hopes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  Signior Bassanio, hear me.</p>

<p>If I do not put on a sober habit,</p>

<p>Talk with respect, and swear but now and then,</p>

<p>Wear prayer books in my pocket, look demurely,</p>

<p>Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes</p>

<p>Thus with my hat, and sigh and say “amen,”</p>

<p>Use all the observance of civility</p>

<p>Like one well studied in a sad ostent</p>

<p>To please his grandam, never trust me more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  Well, we shall see your bearing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>Nay, but I bar tonight. You shall not gauge me</p>

<p>By what we do tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  No, that were pity.</p>

<p>I would entreat you rather to put on</p>

<p>Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends</p>

<p>That purpose merriment. But fare you well.</p>

<p>I have some business.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>And I must to Lorenzo and the rest.</p>

<p>But we will visit you at supper time.</p>
