<p><center><i>[Enter Portia with the Prince of Morocco and both</p>

<p>their trains.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>Go, draw aside the curtains and discover</p>

<p>The several caskets to this noble prince.</p>

<p><center><i>[A curtain is drawn.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now make your choice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morocco</span></p>

<p>This first, of gold, who this inscription bears,</p>

<p>“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men</p>

<p>desire”;</p>

<p>The second, silver, which this promise carries,</p>

<p>“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he</p>

<p>deserves”;</p>

<p>This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,</p>

<p>“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he</p>

<p>hath.”</p>

<p>How shall I know if I do choose the right?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>The one of them contains my picture, prince.</p>

<p>If you choose that, then I am yours withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morocco</span></p>

<p>Some god direct my judgment! Let me see.</p>

<p>I will survey th’ inscriptions back again.</p>

<p>What says this leaden casket?</p>

<p>“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he</p>

<p>hath.”</p>

<p>Must give–for what? For lead? Hazard for lead?</p>

<p>This casket threatens. Men that hazard all</p>

<p>Do it in hope of fair advantages.</p>

<p>A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.</p>

<p>I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.</p>

<p>What says the silver with her virgin hue?</p>

<p>“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he</p>

<p>deserves.”</p>

<p>As much as he deserves–pause there, Morocco,</p>

<p>And weigh thy value with an even hand.</p>

<p>If thou beest rated by thy estimation,</p>

<p>Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough</p>

<p>May not extend so far as to the lady.</p>

<p>And yet to be afeard of my deserving</p>

<p>Were but a weak disabling of myself.</p>

<p>As much as I deserve–why, that’s the lady!</p>

<p>I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,</p>

<p>In graces, and in qualities of breeding,</p>

<p>But more than these, in love I do deserve.</p>

<p>What if I strayed no farther, but chose here?</p>

<p>Let’s see once more this saying graved in gold:</p>

<p>“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men</p>

<p>desire.”</p>

<p>Why, that’s the lady! All the world desires her.</p>

<p>From the four corners of the Earth they come</p>

<p>To kiss this shrine, this mortal, breathing saint.</p>

<p>The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds</p>

<p>Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now</p>

<p>For princes to come view fair Portia.</p>

<p>The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head</p>

<p>Spets in the face of heaven, is no bar</p>

<p>To stop the foreign spirits, but they come</p>

<p>As o’er a brook to see fair Portia.</p>

<p>One of these three contains her heavenly picture.</p>

<p>Is ’t like that lead contains her? ’Twere damnation</p>

<p>To think so base a thought. It were too gross</p>

<p>To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.</p>

<p>Or shall I think in silver she’s immured,</p>

<p>Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?</p>

<p>O, sinful thought! Never so rich a gem</p>

<p>Was set in worse than gold. They have in England</p>

<p>A coin that bears the figure of an angel</p>

<p>Stamped in gold, but that’s insculped upon;</p>

<p>But here an angel in a golden bed</p>

<p>Lies all within.–Deliver me the key.</p>

<p>Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>There, take it, prince. <i>[Handing him the key.]</i> And if</p>

<p>my form lie there,</p>

<p>Then I am yours.</p>

<p>     <i><i>[Morocco opens the gold casket.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morocco</span>  O hell! What have we here?</p>

<p>A carrion death within whose empty eye</p>

<p>There is a written scroll. I’ll read the writing:</p>

<p>     <i>All that glisters is not gold–</i></p>

<p>     <i>Often have you heard that told.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Many a man his life hath sold</i></p>

<p>     <i>But my outside to behold.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Gilded tombs do worms infold.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Had you been as wise as bold,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Young in limbs, in judgment old,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Your answer had not been enscrolled.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fare you well, your suit is cold.</i></p>

<p>Cold indeed and labor lost!</p>

<p>Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost.</p>

<p>Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart</p>

<p>To take a tedious leave. Thus losers part.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits, with his train.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>A gentle riddance! Draw the curtains, go.</p>

<p>Let all of his complexion choose me so.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
