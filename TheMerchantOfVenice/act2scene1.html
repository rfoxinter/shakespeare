<p><center><i>[Enter the Prince of Morocco, a tawny Moor all in</p>

<p>white, and three or four followers accordingly, with</p>

<p>Portia, Nerissa, and their train.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morocco</span></p>

<p>Mislike me not for my complexion,</p>

<p>The shadowed livery of the burnished sun,</p>

<p>To whom I am a neighbor and near bred.</p>

<p>Bring me the fairest creature northward born,</p>

<p>Where Phoebus’ fire scarce thaws the icicles,</p>

<p>And let us make incision for your love</p>

<p>To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.</p>

<p>I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine</p>

<p>Hath feared the valiant; by my love I swear</p>

<p>The best regarded virgins of our clime</p>

<p>Have loved it too. I would not change this hue</p>

<p>Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>In terms of choice I am not solely led</p>

<p>By nice direction of a maiden’s eyes;</p>

<p>Besides, the lott’ry of my destiny</p>

<p>Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.</p>

<p>But if my father had not scanted me</p>

<p>And hedged me by his wit to yield myself</p>

<p>His wife who wins me by that means I told you,</p>

<p>Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair</p>

<p>As any comer I have looked on yet</p>

<p>For my affection.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morocco</span>  Even for that I thank you.</p>

<p>Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets</p>

<p>To try my fortune. By this scimitar</p>

<p>That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,</p>

<p>That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,</p>

<p>I would o’erstare the sternest eyes that look,</p>

<p>Outbrave the heart most daring on the Earth,</p>

<p>Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,</p>

<p>Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,</p>

<p>To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!</p>

<p>If Hercules and Lychas play at dice</p>

<p>Which is the better man, the greater throw</p>

<p>May turn by fortune from the weaker hand;</p>

<p>So is Alcides beaten by his page,</p>

<p>And so may I, blind Fortune leading me,</p>

<p>Miss that which one unworthier may attain,</p>

<p>And die with grieving.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  You must take your chance</p>

<p>And either not attempt to choose at all</p>

<p>Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong</p>

<p>Never to speak to lady afterward</p>

<p>In way of marriage. Therefore be advised.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morocco</span></p>

<p>Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>First, forward to the temple. After dinner</p>

<p>Your hazard shall be made.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Morocco</span>  Good fortune then,</p>

<p>To make me blest–or cursed’st among men!</p>
