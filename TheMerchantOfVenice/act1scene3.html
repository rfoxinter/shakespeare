<p><center><i>[Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Three thousand ducats, well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  Ay, sir, for three months.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  For three months, well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall</p>

<p>be bound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Antonio shall become bound, well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  May you stead me? Will you pleasure me?</p>

<p>Shall I know your answer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Three thousand ducats for three months,</p>

<p>and Antonio bound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  Your answer to that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Antonio is a good man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  Have you heard any imputation to the</p>

<p>contrary?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Ho, no, no, no, no! My meaning in saying he</p>

<p>is a good man is to have you understand me that he</p>

<p>is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he</p>

<p>hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the</p>

<p>Indies. I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto,</p>

<p>he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and</p>

<p>other ventures he hath squandered abroad. But</p>

<p>ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land</p>

<p>rats and water rats, water thieves and land</p>

<p>thieves–I mean pirates–and then there is the</p>

<p>peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,</p>

<p>notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats.</p>

<p>I think I may take his bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  Be assured you may.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  I will be assured I may. And that I may be</p>

<p>assured, I will bethink me. May I speak with</p>

<p>Antonio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  If it please you to dine with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Yes, to smell pork! To eat of the habitation</p>

<p>which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the</p>

<p>devil into! I will buy with you, sell with you, talk</p>

<p>with you, walk with you, and so following; but I</p>

<p>will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with</p>

<p>you.–What news on the Rialto?–Who is he comes</p>

<p>here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antonio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  This is Signior Antonio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>How like a fawning publican he looks!</p>

<p>I hate him for he is a Christian,</p>

<p>But more for that in low simplicity</p>

<p>He lends out money gratis and brings down</p>

<p>The rate of usance here with us in Venice.</p>

<p>If I can catch him once upon the hip,</p>

<p>I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.</p>

<p>He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,</p>

<p>Even there where merchants most do congregate,</p>

<p>On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,</p>

<p>Which he calls “interest.” Cursed be my tribe</p>

<p>If I forgive him!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  Shylock, do you hear?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>I am debating of my present store,</p>

<p>And, by the near guess of my memory,</p>

<p>I cannot instantly raise up the gross</p>

<p>Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?</p>

<p>Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,</p>

<p>Will furnish me. But soft, how many months</p>

<p>Do you desire? <i>[To Antonio.]</i> Rest you fair, good</p>

<p>signior!</p>

<p>Your Worship was the last man in our mouths.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow</p>

<p>By taking nor by giving of excess,</p>

<p>Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,</p>

<p>I’ll break a custom. <i>[To Bassanio.]</i> Is he yet</p>

<p>possessed</p>

<p>How much you would?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Ay, ay, three thousand</p>

<p>ducats.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  And for three months.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>I had forgot–three months. <i>[To Bassanio.]</i></p>

<p>You told me so.–</p>

<p>Well then, your bond. And let me see–but hear</p>

<p>you:</p>

<p>Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow</p>

<p>Upon advantage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  I do never use it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>When Jacob grazed his Uncle Laban’s sheep–</p>

<p>This Jacob from our holy Abram was</p>

<p>(As his wise mother wrought in his behalf)</p>

<p>The third possessor; ay, he was the third–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>And what of him? Did he take interest?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>No, not take interest, not, as you would say,</p>

<p>Directly “interest.” Mark what Jacob did.</p>

<p>When Laban and himself were compromised</p>

<p>That all the eanlings which were streaked and pied</p>

<p>Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank</p>

<p>In end of autumn turned to the rams,</p>

<p>And when the work of generation was</p>

<p>Between these woolly breeders in the act,</p>

<p>The skillful shepherd pilled me certain wands,</p>

<p>And in the doing of the deed of kind</p>

<p>He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,</p>

<p>Who then conceiving did in eaning time</p>

<p>Fall parti-colored lambs, and those were Jacob’s.</p>

<p>This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;</p>

<p>And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for,</p>

<p>A thing not in his power to bring to pass,</p>

<p>But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.</p>

<p>Was this inserted to make interest good?</p>

<p>Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.</p>

<p>But note me, signior–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc> <i>[aside to Bassanio]</i></p>

<p>Mark you this, Bassanio,</p>

<p>The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose!</p>

<p>An evil soul producing holy witness</p>

<p>Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,</p>

<p>A goodly apple rotten at the heart.</p>

<p>O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Three thousand ducats. ’Tis a good round sum.</p>

<p>Three months from twelve, then let me see, the</p>

<p>rate–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Signior Antonio, many a time and oft</p>

<p>In the Rialto you have rated me</p>

<p>About my moneys and my usances.</p>

<p>Still have I borne it with a patient shrug</p>

<p>(For suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe).</p>

<p>You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog,</p>

<p>And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,</p>

<p>And all for use of that which is mine own.</p>

<p>Well then, it now appears you need my help.</p>

<p>Go to, then. You come to me and you say</p>

<p>“Shylock, we would have moneys”–you say so,</p>

<p>You, that did void your rheum upon my beard,</p>

<p>And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur</p>

<p>Over your threshold. Moneys is your suit.</p>

<p>What should I say to you? Should I not say</p>

<p>“Hath a dog money? Is it possible</p>

<p>A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or</p>

<p>Shall I bend low, and in a bondman’s key,</p>

<p>With bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness,</p>

<p>Say this: “Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday</p>

<p>last;</p>

<p>You spurned me such a day; another time</p>

<p>You called me ’dog’; and for these courtesies</p>

<p>I’ll lend you thus much moneys”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>I am as like to call thee so again,</p>

<p>To spet on thee again, to spurn thee, too.</p>

<p>If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not</p>

<p>As to thy friends, for when did friendship take</p>

<p>A breed for barren metal of his friend?</p>

<p>But lend it rather to thine enemy,</p>

<p>Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face</p>

<p>Exact the penalty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Why, look you how you storm!</p>

<p>I would be friends with you and have your love,</p>

<p>Forget the shames that you have stained me with,</p>

<p>Supply your present wants, and take no doit</p>

<p>Of usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me!</p>

<p>This is kind I offer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  This were kindness!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  This kindness will I show.</p>

<p>Go with me to a notary, seal me there</p>

<p>Your single bond; and in a merry sport,</p>

<p>If you repay me not on such a day,</p>

<p>In such a place, such sum or sums as are</p>

<p>Expressed in the condition, let the forfeit</p>

<p>Be nominated for an equal pound</p>

<p>Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken</p>

<p>In what part of your body pleaseth me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Content, in faith. I’ll seal to such a bond,</p>

<p>And say there is much kindness in the Jew.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>You shall not seal to such a bond for me!</p>

<p>I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it!</p>

<p>Within these two months–that’s a month before</p>

<p>This bond expires–I do expect return</p>

<p>Of thrice three times the value of this bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>O father Abram, what these Christians are,</p>

<p>Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect</p>

<p>The thoughts of others! Pray you tell me this:</p>

<p>If he should break his day, what should I gain</p>

<p>By the exaction of the forfeiture?</p>

<p>A pound of man’s flesh taken from a man</p>

<p>Is not so estimable, profitable neither,</p>

<p>As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,</p>

<p>To buy his favor I extend this friendship.</p>

<p>If he will take it, so. If not, adieu;</p>

<p>And for my love I pray you wrong me not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s.</p>

<p>Give him direction for this merry bond,</p>

<p>And I will go and purse the ducats straight,</p>

<p>See to my house left in the fearful guard</p>

<p>Of an unthrifty knave, and presently</p>

<p>I’ll be with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  Hie thee, gentle Jew.</p>

<p><center><i>[Shylock exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>The Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Come on, in this there can be no dismay;</p>

<p>My ships come home a month before the day.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
