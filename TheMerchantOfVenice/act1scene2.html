<p><center><i>[Enter Portia with her waiting woman Nerissa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary</p>

<p>of this great world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries</p>

<p>were in the same abundance as your good fortunes</p>

<p>are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that</p>

<p>surfeit with too much as they that starve with</p>

<p>nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be</p>

<p>seated in the mean. Superfluity comes sooner by</p>

<p>white hairs, but competency lives longer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  Good sentences, and well pronounced.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  They would be better if well followed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  If to do were as easy as to know what were</p>

<p>good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor</p>

<p>men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine</p>

<p>that follows his own instructions. I can easier teach</p>

<p>twenty what were good to be done than to be one of</p>

<p>the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain</p>

<p>may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper</p>

<p>leaps o’er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the</p>

<p>youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the</p>

<p>cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to</p>

<p>choose me a husband. O, me, the word “choose”! I</p>

<p>may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I</p>

<p>dislike. So is the will of a living daughter curbed by</p>

<p>the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that</p>

<p>I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men</p>

<p>at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the</p>

<p>lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of</p>

<p>gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his</p>

<p>meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be</p>

<p>chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly</p>

<p>love. But what warmth is there in your affection</p>

<p>towards any of these princely suitors that are already</p>

<p>come?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  I pray thee, overname them, and as thou</p>

<p>namest them, I will describe them, and according</p>

<p>to my description level at my affection.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but</p>

<p>talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation</p>

<p>to his own good parts that he can shoe him</p>

<p>himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother</p>

<p>played false with a smith.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  Then is there the County Palatine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  He doth nothing but frown, as who should say</p>

<p>“An you will not have me, choose.” He hears</p>

<p>merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the</p>

<p>weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so</p>

<p>full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had</p>

<p>rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in</p>

<p>his mouth than to either of these. God defend me</p>

<p>from these two!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le</p>

<p>Bon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  God made him, and therefore let him pass for</p>

<p>a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker,</p>

<p>but he!–why, he hath a horse better than the</p>

<p>Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than</p>

<p>the Count Palatine. He is every man in no man. If a</p>

<p>throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap’ring. He will</p>

<p>fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I</p>

<p>should marry twenty husbands! If he would despise</p>

<p>me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to</p>

<p>madness, I shall never requite him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  What say you then to Falconbridge, the young</p>

<p>baron of England?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  You know I say nothing to him, for he understands</p>

<p>not me, nor I him. He hath neither Latin,</p>

<p>French, nor Italian; and you will come into the</p>

<p>court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in</p>

<p>the English. He is a proper man’s picture, but alas,</p>

<p>who can converse with a dumb show? How oddly</p>

<p>he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy,</p>

<p>his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany,</p>

<p>and his behavior everywhere.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  What think you of the Scottish lord, his</p>

<p>neighbor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  That he hath a neighborly charity in him, for</p>

<p>he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman,</p>

<p>and swore he would pay him again when he was</p>

<p>able. I think the Frenchman became his surety and</p>

<p>sealed under for another.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  How like you the young German, the Duke of</p>

<p>Saxony’s nephew?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober,</p>

<p>and most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk.</p>

<p>When he is best he is a little worse than a man, and</p>

<p>when he is worst he is little better than a beast. An</p>

<p>the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift</p>

<p>to go without him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  If he should offer to choose, and choose the</p>

<p>right casket, you should refuse to perform your</p>

<p>father’s will if you should refuse to accept him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set</p>

<p>a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary</p>

<p>casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation</p>

<p>without, I know he will choose it. I will do</p>

<p>anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  You need not fear, lady, the having any of</p>

<p>these lords. They have acquainted me with their</p>

<p>determinations, which is indeed to return to their</p>

<p>home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless</p>

<p>you may be won by some other sort than your</p>

<p>father’s imposition depending on the caskets.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as</p>

<p>chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner</p>

<p>of my father’s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers</p>

<p>are so reasonable, for there is not one among them</p>

<p>but I dote on his very absence. And I pray God</p>

<p>grant them a fair departure!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s</p>

<p>time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came</p>

<p>hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  Yes, yes, it was Bassanio–as I think so was he</p>

<p>called.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span>  True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my</p>

<p>foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a</p>

<p>fair lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  I remember him well, and I remember him</p>

<p>worthy of thy praise.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servingman</span>  The four strangers seek for you, madam,</p>

<p>to take their leave. And there is a forerunner come</p>

<p>from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings</p>

<p>word the Prince his master will be here tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good</p>

<p>heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should</p>

<p>be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of</p>

<p>a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather</p>

<p>he should shrive me than wive me.</p>

<p>Come, Nerissa. <i>[To Servingman.]</i> Sirrah, go before.–</p>

<p>Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another</p>

<p>knocks at the door.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
