<p><center><i>[Enter Lorenzo and Jessica.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span></p>

<p>The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,</p>

<p>When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees</p>

<p>And they did make no noise, in such a night</p>

<p>Troilus, methinks, mounted the Trojan walls</p>

<p>And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents</p>

<p>Where Cressid lay that night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span>  In such a night</p>

<p>Did Thisbe fearfully o’ertrip the dew</p>

<p>And saw the lion’s shadow ere himself</p>

<p>And ran dismayed away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  In such a night</p>

<p>Stood Dido with a willow in her hand</p>

<p>Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love</p>

<p>To come again to Carthage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span>  In such a night</p>

<p>Medea gathered the enchanted herbs</p>

<p>That did renew old Aeson.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  In such a night</p>

<p>Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,</p>

<p>And with an unthrift love did run from Venice</p>

<p>As far as Belmont.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span>  In such a night</p>

<p>Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,</p>

<p>Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,</p>

<p>And ne’er a true one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  In such a night</p>

<p>Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,</p>

<p>Slander her love, and he forgave it her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span></p>

<p>I would out-night you did nobody come,</p>

<p>But hark, I hear the footing of a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Stephano, a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span></p>

<p>Who comes so fast in silence of the night?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span>  A friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span></p>

<p>A friend? What friend? Your name, I pray you,</p>

<p>friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span></p>

<p>Stephano is my name, and I bring word</p>

<p>My mistress will before the break of day</p>

<p>Be here at Belmont. She doth stray about</p>

<p>By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays</p>

<p>For happy wedlock hours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  Who comes with her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Stephano</span></p>

<p>None but a holy hermit and her maid.</p>

<p>I pray you, is my master yet returned?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span></p>

<p>He is not, nor we have not heard from him.–</p>

<p>But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,</p>

<p>And ceremoniously let us prepare</p>

<p>Some welcome for the mistress of the house.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lancelet, the Clown.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  Sola, sola! Wo ha, ho! Sola, sola!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  Who calls?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master</p>

<p>Lorenzo, sola, sola!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  Leave holloaing, man! Here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  Sola! Where, where?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  Here!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  Tell him there’s a post come from my master</p>

<p>with his horn full of good news. My master will</p>

<p>be here ere morning, sweet soul.     <i><i>[Lancelet exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span> <i>[to Jessica]</i></p>

<p>Let’s in, and there expect their coming.</p>

<p>And yet no matter; why should we go in?–</p>

<p>My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,</p>

<p>Within the house, your mistress is at hand,</p>

<p>And bring your music forth into the air.</p>

<p><center><i>[Stephano exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank.</p>

<p>Here will we sit and let the sounds of music</p>

<p>Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night</p>

<p>Become the touches of sweet harmony.</p>

<p>Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven</p>

<p>Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.</p>

<p>There’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st</p>

<p>But in his motion like an angel sings,</p>

<p>Still choiring to the young-eyed cherubins.</p>

<p>Such harmony is in immortal souls,</p>

<p>But whilst this muddy vesture of decay</p>

<p>Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Stephano and musicians.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn.</p>

<p>With sweetest touches pierce your mistress’ ear,</p>

<p>And draw her home with music.</p>

<p><center><i>[Music plays.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span></p>

<p>I am never merry when I hear sweet music.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span></p>

<p>The reason is, your spirits are attentive.</p>

<p>For do but note a wild and wanton herd</p>

<p>Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,</p>

<p>Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,</p>

<p>Which is the hot condition of their blood,</p>

<p>If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,</p>

<p>Or any air of music touch their ears,</p>

<p>You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,</p>

<p>Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze</p>

<p>By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet</p>

<p>Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and</p>

<p>floods,</p>

<p>Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,</p>

<p>But music for the time doth change his nature.</p>

<p>The man that hath no music in himself,</p>

<p>Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,</p>

<p>Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;</p>

<p>The motions of his spirit are dull as night,</p>

<p>And his affections dark as Erebus.</p>

<p>Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Portia and Nerissa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>That light we see is burning in my hall.</p>

<p>How far that little candle throws his beams!</p>

<p>So shines a good deed in a naughty world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span></p>

<p>When the moon shone we did not see the candle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>So doth the greater glory dim the less.</p>

<p>A substitute shines brightly as a king</p>

<p>Until a king be by, and then his state</p>

<p>Empties itself as doth an inland brook</p>

<p>Into the main of waters. Music, hark!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span></p>

<p>It is your music, madam, of the house.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>Nothing is good, I see, without respect.</p>

<p>Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span></p>

<p>Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark</p>

<p>When neither is attended, and I think</p>

<p>The nightingale, if she should sing by day</p>

<p>When every goose is cackling, would be thought</p>

<p>No better a musician than the wren.</p>

<p>How many things by season seasoned are</p>

<p>To their right praise and true perfection!</p>

<p>Peace–how the moon sleeps with Endymion</p>

<p>And would not be awaked!</p>

<p><center><i>[Music ceases.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  That is the voice,</p>

<p>Or I am much deceived, of Portia.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,</p>

<p>By the bad voice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  Dear lady, welcome home.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>We have been praying for our husbands’ welfare,</p>

<p>Which speed we hope the better for our words.</p>

<p>Are they returned?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  Madam, they are not yet,</p>

<p>But there is come a messenger before</p>

<p>To signify their coming.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  Go in, Nerissa.</p>

<p>Give order to my servants that they take</p>

<p>No note at all of our being absent hence–</p>

<p>Nor you, Lorenzo–Jessica, nor you.</p>

<p><center><i>[A trumpet sounds.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span></p>

<p>Your husband is at hand. I hear his trumpet.</p>

<p>We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>This night methinks is but the daylight sick;</p>

<p>It looks a little paler. ’Tis a day</p>

<p>Such as the day is when the sun is hid.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano, and their followers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span></p>

<p>We should hold day with the Antipodes</p>

<p>If you would walk in absence of the sun.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>Let me give light, but let me not be light,</p>

<p>For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,</p>

<p>And never be Bassanio so for me.</p>

<p>But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gratiano and Nerissa talk aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span></p>

<p>I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.</p>

<p>This is the man, this is Antonio,</p>

<p>To whom I am so infinitely bound.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>You should in all sense be much bound to him,</p>

<p>For as I hear he was much bound for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>No more than I am well acquitted of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>Sir, you are very welcome to our house.</p>

<p>It must appear in other ways than words;</p>

<p>Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span> <i>[to Nerissa]</i></p>

<p>By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong!</p>

<p>In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk.</p>

<p>Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,</p>

<p>Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>A quarrel ho, already! What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span></p>

<p>About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring</p>

<p>That she did give me, whose posy was</p>

<p>For all the world like cutler’s poetry</p>

<p>Upon a knife, “Love me, and leave me not.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span></p>

<p>What talk you of the posy or the value?</p>

<p>You swore to me when I did give it you</p>

<p>That you would wear it till your hour of death,</p>

<p>And that it should lie with you in your grave.</p>

<p>Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,</p>

<p>You should have been respective and have kept it.</p>

<p>Gave it a judge’s clerk! No, God’s my judge,</p>

<p>The clerk will ne’er wear hair on ’s face that had it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span></p>

<p>He will, an if he live to be a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span></p>

<p>Ay, if a woman live to be a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span></p>

<p>Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,</p>

<p>A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,</p>

<p>No higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk,</p>

<p>A prating boy that begged it as a fee.</p>

<p>I could not for my heart deny it him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>You were to blame, I must be plain with you,</p>

<p>To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift,</p>

<p>A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,</p>

<p>And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.</p>

<p>I gave my love a ring and made him swear</p>

<p>Never to part with it, and here he stands.</p>

<p>I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it</p>

<p>Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth</p>

<p>That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,</p>

<p>You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief.</p>

<p>An ’twere to me I should be mad at it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Why, I were best to cut my left hand off</p>

<p>And swear I lost the ring defending it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span></p>

<p>My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away</p>

<p>Unto the judge that begged it, and indeed</p>

<p>Deserved it, too. And then the boy, his clerk,</p>

<p>That took some pains in writing, he begged mine,</p>

<p>And neither man nor master would take aught</p>

<p>But the two rings.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  What ring gave you, my lord?</p>

<p>Not that, I hope, which you received of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span></p>

<p>If I could add a lie unto a fault,</p>

<p>I would deny it, but you see my finger</p>

<p>Hath not the ring upon it. It is gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>Even so void is your false heart of truth.</p>

<p>By heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed</p>

<p>Until I see the ring!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span> <i>[to Gratiano]</i>  Nor I in yours</p>

<p>Till I again see mine!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span>  Sweet Portia,</p>

<p>If you did know to whom I gave the ring,</p>

<p>If you did know for whom I gave the ring,</p>

<p>And would conceive for what I gave the ring,</p>

<p>And how unwillingly I left the ring,</p>

<p>When naught would be accepted but the ring,</p>

<p>You would abate the strength of your displeasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>If you had known the virtue of the ring,</p>

<p>Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,</p>

<p>Or your own honor to contain the ring,</p>

<p>You would not then have parted with the ring.</p>

<p>What man is there so much unreasonable,</p>

<p>If you had pleased to have defended it</p>

<p>With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty</p>

<p>To urge the thing held as a ceremony?</p>

<p>Nerissa teaches me what to believe:</p>

<p>I’ll die for ’t but some woman had the ring!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span></p>

<p>No, by my honor, madam, by my soul,</p>

<p>No woman had it, but a civil doctor,</p>

<p>Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me</p>

<p>And begged the ring, the which I did deny him</p>

<p>And suffered him to go displeased away,</p>

<p>Even he that had held up the very life</p>

<p>Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?</p>

<p>I was enforced to send it after him.</p>

<p>I was beset with shame and courtesy.</p>

<p>My honor would not let ingratitude</p>

<p>So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady,</p>

<p>For by these blessed candles of the night,</p>

<p>Had you been there, I think you would have begged</p>

<p>The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>Let not that doctor e’er come near my house!</p>

<p>Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,</p>

<p>And that which you did swear to keep for me,</p>

<p>I will become as liberal as you:</p>

<p>I’ll not deny him anything I have,</p>

<p>No, not my body, nor my husband’s bed.</p>

<p>Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.</p>

<p>Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus.</p>

<p>If you do not, if I be left alone,</p>

<p>Now by mine honor, which is yet mine own,</p>

<p>I’ll have that doctor for my bedfellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span></p>

<p>And I his clerk. Therefore be well advised</p>

<p>How you do leave me to mine own protection.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span></p>

<p>Well, do you so. Let not me take him, then,</p>

<p>For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>I am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>Sir, grieve not you. You are welcome</p>

<p>notwithstanding.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span></p>

<p>Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,</p>

<p>And in the hearing of these many friends</p>

<p>I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,</p>

<p>Wherein I see myself–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  Mark you but that!</p>

<p>In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,</p>

<p>In each eye one. Swear by your double self,</p>

<p>And there’s an oath of credit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span>  Nay, but hear me.</p>

<p>Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear</p>

<p>I never more will break an oath with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>I once did lend my body for his wealth,</p>

<p>Which but for him that had your husband’s ring</p>

<p>Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,</p>

<p>My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord</p>

<p>Will never more break faith advisedly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,</p>

<p><center><i>[Giving Antonio a ring.]</i></center></p>

<p>And bid him keep it better than the other.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span></p>

<p>By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,</p>

<p>For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span></p>

<p>And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,</p>

<p>For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor’s clerk,</p>

<p>In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.</p>

<p><center><i>[She shows a ring.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span></p>

<p>Why, this is like the mending of highways</p>

<p>In summer, where the ways are fair enough!</p>

<p>What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span></p>

<p>Speak not so grossly.–You are all amazed.</p>

<p><center><i>[She hands a paper to Bassanio.]</i></center></p>

<p>Here is a letter; read it at your leisure.</p>

<p>It comes from Padua from Bellario.</p>

<p>There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,</p>

<p>Nerissa there, her clerk. Lorenzo here</p>

<p>Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,</p>

<p>And even but now returned. I have not yet</p>

<p>Entered my house.–Antonio, you are welcome,</p>

<p>And I have better news in store for you</p>

<p>Than you expect. Unseal this letter soon.</p>

<p><center><i>[Handing him a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>There you shall find three of your argosies</p>

<p>Are richly come to harbor suddenly.</p>

<p>You shall not know by what strange accident</p>

<p>I chanced on this letter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  I am dumb.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span></p>

<p>Were you the doctor and I knew you not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span></p>

<p>Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span></p>

<p>Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,</p>

<p>Unless he live until he be a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span> <i>[to Portia]</i></p>

<p>Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.</p>

<p>When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;</p>

<p>For here I read for certain that my ships</p>

<p>Are safely come to road.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  How now, Lorenzo?</p>

<p>My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nerissa</span></p>

<p>Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.</p>

<p><center><i>[Handing him a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>There do I give to you and Jessica,</p>

<p>From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,</p>

<p>After his death, of all he dies possessed of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span></p>

<p>Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way</p>

<p>Of starved people.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Portia</span>  It is almost morning,</p>

<p>And yet I am sure you are not satisfied</p>

<p>Of these events at full. Let us go in,</p>

<p>And charge us there upon inter’gatories,</p>

<p>And we will answer all things faithfully.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span></p>

<p>Let it be so. The first inter’gatory</p>

<p>That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is</p>

<p>Whether till the next night she had rather stay</p>

<p>Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.</p>

<p>But were the day come, I should wish it dark</p>

<p>Till I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.</p>

<p>Well, while I live, I’ll fear no other thing</p>

<p>So sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.</p>
