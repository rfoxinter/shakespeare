<p><center><i>[Enter Shylock, the Jew, and Lancelet,</p>

<p>his man that was, the Clown.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,</p>

<p>The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.–</p>

<p>What, Jessica!–Thou shalt not gormandize</p>

<p>As thou hast done with me–what, Jessica!–</p>

<p>And sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out.–</p>

<p>Why, Jessica, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Why, Jessica!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  Your Worship was wont to tell me I could</p>

<p>do nothing without bidding.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Jessica.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jessica</sc>  Call you? What is your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.</p>

<p>There are my keys.–But wherefore should I go?</p>

<p>I am not bid for love. They flatter me.</p>

<p>But yet I’ll go in hate, to feed upon</p>

<p>The prodigal Christian.–Jessica, my girl,</p>

<p>Look to my house.–I am right loath to go.</p>

<p>There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,</p>

<p>For I did dream of money bags tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  I beseech you, sir, go. My young master</p>

<p>doth expect your reproach.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  So do I his.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  And they have conspired together–I will</p>

<p>not say you shall see a masque, but if you do, then it</p>

<p>was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on</p>

<p>Black Monday last, at six o’clock i’ th’ morning,</p>

<p>falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four</p>

<p>year in th’ afternoon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica,</p>

<p>Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum</p>

<p>And the vile squealing of the wry-necked fife,</p>

<p>Clamber not you up to the casements then,</p>

<p>Nor thrust your head into the public street</p>

<p>To gaze on Christian fools with varnished faces,</p>

<p>But stop my house’s ears (I mean my casements).</p>

<p>Let not the sound of shallow fopp’ry enter</p>

<p>My sober house. By Jacob’s staff I swear</p>

<p>I have no mind of feasting forth tonight.</p>

<p>But I will go.–Go you before me, sirrah.</p>

<p>Say I will come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lancelet</sc>  I will go before, sir. <i>[Aside to Jessica.]</i> Mistress,</p>

<p>look out at window for all this.</p>

<p>There will come a Christian by</p>

<p>Will be worth a Jewess’ eye.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jessica</sc></p>

<p>His words were “Farewell, mistress,” nothing else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,</p>

<p>Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day</p>

<p>More than the wildcat. Drones hive not with me,</p>

<p>Therefore I part with him, and part with him</p>

<p>To one that I would have him help to waste</p>

<p>His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in.</p>

<p>Perhaps I will return immediately.</p>

<p>Do as I bid you. Shut doors after you.</p>

<p>Fast bind, fast find–</p>

<p>A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jessica</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, and if my fortune be not crossed,</p>

<p>I have a father, you a daughter, lost.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>
