<p><center><i>[Enter Salarino and Solanio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc></p>

<p>Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;</p>

<p>With him is Gratiano gone along;</p>

<p>And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Solanio</sc></p>

<p>The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke,</p>

<p>Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc></p>

<p>He came too late; the ship was under sail.</p>

<p>But there the Duke was given to understand</p>

<p>That in a gondola were seen together</p>

<p>Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.</p>

<p>Besides, Antonio certified the Duke</p>

<p>They were not with Bassanio in his ship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Solanio</sc></p>

<p>I never heard a passion so confused,</p>

<p>So strange, outrageous, and so variable</p>

<p>As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.</p>

<p>“My daughter, O my ducats, O my daughter!</p>

<p>Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!</p>

<p>Justice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter,</p>

<p>A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,</p>

<p>Of double ducats, stol’n from me by my daughter,</p>

<p>And jewels–two stones, two rich and precious</p>

<p>stones–</p>

<p>Stol’n by my daughter! Justice! Find the girl!</p>

<p>She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc></p>

<p>Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,</p>

<p>Crying “His stones, his daughter, and his ducats.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Solanio</sc></p>

<p>Let good Antonio look he keep his day,</p>

<p>Or he shall pay for this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc>  Marry, well remembered.</p>

<p>I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday</p>

<p>Who told me, in the Narrow Seas that part</p>

<p>The French and English, there miscarried</p>

<p>A vessel of our country richly fraught.</p>

<p>I thought upon Antonio when he told me,</p>

<p>And wished in silence that it were not his.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Solanio</sc></p>

<p>You were best to tell Antonio what you hear–</p>

<p>Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc></p>

<p>A kinder gentleman treads not the Earth.</p>

<p>I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.</p>

<p>Bassanio told him he would make some speed</p>

<p>Of his return. He answered “Do not so.</p>

<p>Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,</p>

<p>But stay the very riping of the time;</p>

<p>And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me,</p>

<p>Let it not enter in your mind of love.</p>

<p>Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts</p>

<p>To courtship and such fair ostents of love</p>

<p>As shall conveniently become you there.”</p>

<p>And even there, his eye being big with tears,</p>

<p>Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,</p>

<p>And with affection wondrous sensible</p>

<p>He wrung Bassanio’s hand–and so they parted.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Solanio</sc></p>

<p>I think he only loves the world for him.</p>

<p>I pray thee, let us go and find him out</p>

<p>And quicken his embraced heaviness</p>

<p>With some delight or other.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc>  Do we so.</p>
