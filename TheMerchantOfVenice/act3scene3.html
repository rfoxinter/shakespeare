<p><center><i>[Enter Shylock, the Jew, and Solanio, and Antonio,</p>

<p>and the Jailer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shylock</span></p>

<p>Jailer, look to him. Tell not me of mercy.</p>

<p>This is the fool that lent out money gratis.</p>

<p>Jailer, look to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Hear me yet, good Shylock–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shylock</span></p>

<p>I’ll have my bond. Speak not against my bond.</p>

<p>I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.</p>

<p>Thou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,</p>

<p>But since I am a dog, beware my fangs.</p>

<p>The Duke shall grant me justice.–I do wonder,</p>

<p>Thou naughty jailer, that thou art so fond</p>

<p>To come abroad with him at his request.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  I pray thee, hear me speak–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Shylock</span></p>

<p>I’ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak.</p>

<p>I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.</p>

<p>I’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,</p>

<p>To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield</p>

<p>To Christian intercessors. Follow not!</p>

<p>I’ll have no speaking. I will have my bond.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Solanio</span></p>

<p>It is the most impenetrable cur</p>

<p>That ever kept with men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Let him alone.</p>

<p>I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.</p>

<p>He seeks my life. His reason well I know:</p>

<p>I oft delivered from his forfeitures</p>

<p>Many that have at times made moan to me.</p>

<p>Therefore he hates me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Solanio</span>  I am sure the Duke</p>

<p>Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>The Duke cannot deny the course of law,</p>

<p>For the commodity that strangers have</p>

<p>With us in Venice, if it be denied,</p>

<p>Will much impeach the justice of the state,</p>

<p>Since that the trade and profit of the city</p>

<p>Consisteth of all nations. Therefore go.</p>

<p>These griefs and losses have so bated me</p>

<p>That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh</p>

<p>Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.–</p>

<p>Well, jailer, on.–Pray God Bassanio come</p>

<p>To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.</p>
