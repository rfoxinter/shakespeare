<p><center><i>[Enter Nerissa and a Servitor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nerissa</sc></p>

<p>Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight.</p>

<p>The Prince of Arragon hath ta’en his oath</p>

<p>And comes to his election presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Prince of Arragon, his train, and Portia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince.</p>

<p>If you choose that wherein I am contained,</p>

<p>Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized.</p>

<p>But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,</p>

<p>You must be gone from hence immediately.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arragon</sc></p>

<p>I am enjoined by oath to observe three things:</p>

<p>First, never to unfold to anyone</p>

<p>Which casket ’twas I chose; next, if I fail</p>

<p>Of the right casket, never in my life</p>

<p>To woo a maid in way of marriage;</p>

<p>Lastly, if I do fail in fortune of my choice,</p>

<p>Immediately to leave you, and be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>To these injunctions everyone doth swear</p>

<p>That comes to hazard for my worthless self.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arragon</sc></p>

<p>And so have I addressed me. Fortune now</p>

<p>To my heart’s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead.</p>

<p>“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he</p>

<p>hath.”</p>

<p>You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.</p>

<p>What says the golden chest? Ha, let me see:</p>

<p>“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men</p>

<p>desire.”</p>

<p>What many men desire–that “many” may be</p>

<p>meant</p>

<p>By the fool multitude that choose by show,</p>

<p>Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,</p>

<p>Which pries not to th’ interior, but like the martlet</p>

<p>Builds in the weather on the outward wall,</p>

<p>Even in the force and road of casualty.</p>

<p>I will not choose what many men desire,</p>

<p>Because I will not jump with common spirits</p>

<p>And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.</p>

<p>Why, then, to thee, thou silver treasure house.</p>

<p>Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.</p>

<p>“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he</p>

<p>deserves.”</p>

<p>And well said, too; for who shall go about</p>

<p>To cozen fortune and be honorable</p>

<p>Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume</p>

<p>To wear an undeserved dignity.</p>

<p>O, that estates, degrees, and offices</p>

<p>Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honor</p>

<p>Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!</p>

<p>How many then should cover that stand bare?</p>

<p>How many be commanded that command?</p>

<p>How much low peasantry would then be gleaned</p>

<p>From the true seed of honor? And how much honor</p>

<p>Picked from the chaff and ruin of the times,</p>

<p>To be new varnished? Well, but to my choice.</p>

<p>“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he</p>

<p>deserves.”</p>

<p>I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,</p>

<p><center><i>[He is given a key.]</i></center></p>

<p>And instantly unlock my fortunes here.</p>

<p><center><i>[He opens the silver casket.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>Too long a pause for that which you find there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arragon</sc></p>

<p>What’s here? The portrait of a blinking idiot</p>

<p>Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.–</p>

<p>How much unlike art thou to Portia!</p>

<p>How much unlike my hopes and my deservings.</p>

<p>“Who chooseth me shall have as much as he</p>

<p>deserves”?</p>

<p>Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head?</p>

<p>Is that my prize? Are my deserts no better?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>To offend and judge are distinct offices</p>

<p>And of opposed natures.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Arragon</sc>  What is here?</p>

<p><center><i>[He reads.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>The fire seven times tried this;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Seven times tried that judgment is</i></p>

<p>     <i>That did never choose amiss.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Some there be that shadows kiss;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Such have but a shadow’s bliss.</i></p>

<p>     <i>There be fools alive, iwis,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Silvered o’er–and so was this.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Take what wife you will to bed,</i></p>

<p>     <i>I will ever be your head.</i></p>

<p>     <i>So begone; you are sped.</i></p>

<p>Still more fool I shall appear</p>

<p>By the time I linger here.</p>

<p>With one fool’s head I came to woo,</p>

<p>But I go away with two.</p>

<p>Sweet, adieu. I’ll keep my oath,</p>

<p>Patiently to bear my wroth.     <i><i>[He exits with his train.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>Thus hath the candle singed the moth.</p>

<p>O, these deliberate fools, when they do choose,</p>

<p>They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nerissa</sc></p>

<p>The ancient saying is no heresy:</p>

<p>Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc>  Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Where is my lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc>  Here. What would my</p>

<p>lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Madam, there is alighted at your gate</p>

<p>A young Venetian, one that comes before</p>

<p>To signify th’ approaching of his lord,</p>

<p>From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;</p>

<p>To wit (besides commends and courteous breath),</p>

<p>Gifts of rich value; yet I have not seen</p>

<p>So likely an ambassador of love.</p>

<p>A day in April never came so sweet,</p>

<p>To show how costly summer was at hand,</p>

<p>As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>No more, I pray thee. I am half afeard</p>

<p>Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,</p>

<p>Thou spend’st such high-day wit in praising him!</p>

<p>Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see</p>

<p>Quick Cupid’s post that comes so mannerly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nerissa</sc></p>

<p>Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
