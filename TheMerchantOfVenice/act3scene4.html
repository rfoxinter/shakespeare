<p><center><i>[Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo, Jessica, and Balthazar,</p>

<p>a man of Portia’s.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lorenzo</sc></p>

<p>Madam, although I speak it in your presence,</p>

<p>You have a noble and a true conceit</p>

<p>Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly</p>

<p>In bearing thus the absence of your lord.</p>

<p>But if you knew to whom you show this honor,</p>

<p>How true a gentleman you send relief,</p>

<p>How dear a lover of my lord your husband,</p>

<p>I know you would be prouder of the work</p>

<p>Than customary bounty can enforce you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>I never did repent for doing good,</p>

<p>Nor shall not now; for in companions</p>

<p>That do converse and waste the time together,</p>

<p>Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,</p>

<p>There must be needs a like proportion</p>

<p>Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;</p>

<p>Which makes me think that this Antonio,</p>

<p>Being the bosom lover of my lord,</p>

<p>Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,</p>

<p>How little is the cost I have bestowed</p>

<p>In purchasing the semblance of my soul</p>

<p>From out the state of hellish cruelty!</p>

<p>This comes too near the praising of myself;</p>

<p>Therefore no more of it. Hear other things:</p>

<p>Lorenzo, I commit into your hands</p>

<p>The husbandry and manage of my house</p>

<p>Until my lord’s return. For mine own part,</p>

<p>I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow</p>

<p>To live in prayer and contemplation,</p>

<p>Only attended by Nerissa here,</p>

<p>Until her husband and my lord’s return.</p>

<p>There is a monastery two miles off,</p>

<p>And there we will abide. I do desire you</p>

<p>Not to deny this imposition,</p>

<p>The which my love and some necessity</p>

<p>Now lays upon you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lorenzo</sc>  Madam, with all my heart.</p>

<p>I shall obey you in all fair commands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>My people do already know my mind</p>

<p>And will acknowledge you and Jessica</p>

<p>In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.</p>

<p>So fare you well till we shall meet again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lorenzo</sc></p>

<p>Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jessica</sc></p>

<p>I wish your Ladyship all heart’s content.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased</p>

<p>To wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lorenzo and Jessica exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now, Balthazar,</p>

<p>As I have ever found thee honest true,</p>

<p>So let me find thee still: take this same letter,</p>

<p>And use thou all th’ endeavor of a man</p>

<p>In speed to Padua. See thou render this</p>

<p>Into my cousin’s hands, Doctor Bellario.</p>

<p><center><i>[She gives him a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>And look what notes and garments he doth give</p>

<p>thee,</p>

<p>Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed</p>

<p>Unto the traject, to the common ferry</p>

<p>Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,</p>

<p>But get thee gone. I shall be there before thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Balthazar</sc></p>

<p>Madam, I go with all convenient speed.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand</p>

<p>That you yet know not of. We’ll see our husbands</p>

<p>Before they think of us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nerissa</sc>  Shall they see us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit</p>

<p>That they shall think we are accomplished</p>

<p>With that we lack. I’ll hold thee any wager,</p>

<p>When we are both accoutered like young men,</p>

<p>I’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,</p>

<p>And wear my dagger with the braver grace,</p>

<p>And speak between the change of man and boy</p>

<p>With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps</p>

<p>Into a manly stride, and speak of frays</p>

<p>Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies</p>

<p>How honorable ladies sought my love,</p>

<p>Which I denying, they fell sick and died–</p>

<p>I could not do withal!–then I’ll repent,</p>

<p>And wish, for all that, that I had not killed them.</p>

<p>And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell,</p>

<p>That men shall swear I have discontinued school</p>

<p>Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind</p>

<p>A thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks</p>

<p>Which I will practice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nerissa</sc>  Why, shall we turn to men?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc>  Fie, what a question’s that,</p>

<p>If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!</p>

<p>But come, I’ll tell thee all my whole device</p>

<p>When I am in my coach, which stays for us</p>

<p>At the park gate; and therefore haste away,</p>

<p>For we must measure twenty miles today.</p>
