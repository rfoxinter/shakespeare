<p><center><i>[Enter Antonio, Salarino, and Solanio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>In sooth I know not why I am so sad.</p>

<p>It wearies me, you say it wearies you.</p>

<p>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</p>

<p>What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,</p>

<p>I am to learn.</p>

<p>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me</p>

<p>That I have much ado to know myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salarino</span></p>

<p>Your mind is tossing on the ocean,</p>

<p>There where your argosies with portly sail</p>

<p>(Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</p>

<p>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea)</p>

<p>Do overpeer the petty traffickers</p>

<p>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</p>

<p>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Solanio</span></p>

<p>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</p>

<p>The better part of my affections would</p>

<p>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</p>

<p>Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,</p>

<p>Piring in maps for ports and piers and roads;</p>

<p>And every object that might make me fear</p>

<p>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</p>

<p>Would make me sad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salarino</span>  My wind cooling my broth</p>

<p>Would blow me to an ague when I thought</p>

<p>What harm a wind too great might do at sea.</p>

<p>I should not see the sandy hourglass run</p>

<p>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</p>

<p>And see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand,</p>

<p>Vailing her high top lower than her ribs</p>

<p>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</p>

<p>And see the holy edifice of stone</p>

<p>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</p>

<p>Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,</p>

<p>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</p>

<p>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</p>

<p>And, in a word, but even now worth this</p>

<p>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</p>

<p>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</p>

<p>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</p>

<p>But tell not me: I know Antonio</p>

<p>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it,</p>

<p>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</p>

<p>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</p>

<p>Upon the fortune of this present year:</p>

<p>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Solanio</span></p>

<p>Why then you are in love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Fie, fie!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Solanio</span></p>

<p>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad</p>

<p>Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy</p>

<p>For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry</p>

<p>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed</p>

<p>Janus,</p>

<p>Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:</p>

<p>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes</p>

<p>And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper,</p>

<p>And other of such vinegar aspect</p>

<p>That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile</p>

<p>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo, and Gratiano.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,</p>

<p>Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare you well.</p>

<p>We leave you now with better company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salarino</span></p>

<p>I would have stayed till I had made you merry,</p>

<p>If worthier friends had not prevented me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>Your worth is very dear in my regard.</p>

<p>I take it your own business calls on you,</p>

<p>And you embrace th’ occasion to depart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salarino</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, my good lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span></p>

<p>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say,</p>

<p>when?</p>

<p>You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salarino</span></p>

<p>We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.</p>

<p><center><i>[Salarino and Solanio exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span></p>

<p>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</p>

<p>We two will leave you. But at dinner time</p>

<p>I pray you have in mind where we must meet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span></p>

<p>I will not fail you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span></p>

<p>You look not well, Signior Antonio.</p>

<p>You have too much respect upon the world.</p>

<p>They lose it that do buy it with much care.</p>

<p>Believe me, you are marvelously changed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,</p>

<p>A stage where every man must play a part,</p>

<p>And mine a sad one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span>  Let me play the fool.</p>

<p>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</p>

<p>And let my liver rather heat with wine</p>

<p>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</p>

<p>Why should a man whose blood is warm within</p>

<p>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</p>

<p>Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice</p>

<p>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio</p>

<p>(I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks):</p>

<p>There are a sort of men whose visages</p>

<p>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond</p>

<p>And do a willful stillness entertain</p>

<p>With purpose to be dressed in an opinion</p>

<p>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</p>

<p>As who should say “I am Sir Oracle,</p>

<p>And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.”</p>

<p>O my Antonio, I do know of these</p>

<p>That therefore only are reputed wise</p>

<p>For saying nothing, when, I am very sure,</p>

<p>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears</p>

<p>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers</p>

<p>fools.</p>

<p>I’ll tell thee more of this another time.</p>

<p>But fish not with this melancholy bait</p>

<p>For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.–</p>

<p>Come, good Lorenzo.–Fare you well a while.</p>

<p>I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span></p>

<p>Well, we will leave you then till dinner time.</p>

<p>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</p>

<p>For Gratiano never lets me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span></p>

<p>Well, keep me company but two years more,</p>

<p>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own</p>

<p>tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>Fare you well. I’ll grow a talker for this gear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gratiano</span></p>

<p>Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable</p>

<p>In a neat’s tongue dried and a maid not vendible.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gratiano and Lorenzo exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  Is that anything now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span>  Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing,</p>

<p>more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as</p>

<p>two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you</p>

<p>shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you</p>

<p>have them, they are not worth the search.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>Well, tell me now what lady is the same</p>

<p>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,</p>

<p>That you today promised to tell me of?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span></p>

<p>’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</p>

<p>How much I have disabled mine estate</p>

<p>By something showing a more swelling port</p>

<p>Than my faint means would grant continuance.</p>

<p>Nor do I now make moan to be abridged</p>

<p>From such a noble rate. But my chief care</p>

<p>Is to come fairly off from the great debts</p>

<p>Wherein my time, something too prodigal,</p>

<p>Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,</p>

<p>I owe the most in money and in love,</p>

<p>And from your love I have a warranty</p>

<p>To unburden all my plots and purposes</p>

<p>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;</p>

<p>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</p>

<p>Within the eye of honor, be assured</p>

<p>My purse, my person, my extremest means</p>

<p>Lie all unlocked to your occasions.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span></p>

<p>In my school days, when I had lost one shaft,</p>

<p>I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight</p>

<p>The selfsame way with more advised watch</p>

<p>To find the other forth; and by adventuring both</p>

<p>I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof</p>

<p>Because what follows is pure innocence.</p>

<p>I owe you much, and, like a willful youth,</p>

<p>That which I owe is lost. But if you please</p>

<p>To shoot another arrow that self way</p>

<p>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</p>

<p>As I will watch the aim, or to find both</p>

<p>Or bring your latter hazard back again,</p>

<p>And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>You know me well, and herein spend but time</p>

<p>To wind about my love with circumstance;</p>

<p>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</p>

<p>In making question of my uttermost</p>

<p>Than if you had made waste of all I have.</p>

<p>Then do but say to me what I should do</p>

<p>That in your knowledge may by me be done,</p>

<p>And I am prest unto it. Therefore speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bassanio</span></p>

<p>In Belmont is a lady richly left,</p>

<p>And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,</p>

<p>Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes</p>

<p>I did receive fair speechless messages.</p>

<p>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued</p>

<p>To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia.</p>

<p>Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,</p>

<p>For the four winds blow in from every coast</p>

<p>Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks</p>

<p>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,</p>

<p>Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strond,</p>

<p>And many Jasons come in quest of her.</p>

<p>O my Antonio, had I but the means</p>

<p>To hold a rival place with one of them,</p>

<p>I have a mind presages me such thrift</p>

<p>That I should questionless be fortunate!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span></p>

<p>Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea;</p>

<p>Neither have I money nor commodity</p>

<p>To raise a present sum. Therefore go forth:</p>

<p>Try what my credit can in Venice do;</p>

<p>That shall be racked even to the uttermost</p>

<p>To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.</p>

<p>Go presently inquire, and so will I,</p>

<p>Where money is, and I no question make</p>

<p>To have it of my trust, or for my sake.</p>
