<p><center><i>[Enter the Duke, the Magnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio,</p>

<p>Salerio, and Gratiano, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  What, is Antonio here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  Ready, so please your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>I am sorry for thee. Thou art come to answer</p>

<p>A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,</p>

<p>Uncapable of pity, void and empty</p>

<p>From any dram of mercy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc>  I have heard</p>

<p>Your Grace hath ta’en great pains to qualify</p>

<p>His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,</p>

<p>And that no lawful means can carry me</p>

<p>Out of his envy’s reach, I do oppose</p>

<p>My patience to his fury, and am armed</p>

<p>To suffer with a quietness of spirit</p>

<p>The very tyranny and rage of his.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Go, one, and call the Jew into the court.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salerio</sc></p>

<p>He is ready at the door. He comes, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Shylock.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Make room, and let him stand before our face.–</p>

<p>Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,</p>

<p>That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice</p>

<p>To the last hour of act, and then, ’tis thought,</p>

<p>Thou ’lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange</p>

<p>Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;</p>

<p>And where thou now exacts the penalty,</p>

<p>Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh,</p>

<p>Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,</p>

<p>But, touched with humane gentleness and love,</p>

<p>Forgive a moi’ty of the principal,</p>

<p>Glancing an eye of pity on his losses</p>

<p>That have of late so huddled on his back,</p>

<p>Enow to press a royal merchant down</p>

<p>And pluck commiseration of his state</p>

<p>From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,</p>

<p>From stubborn Turks, and Tartars never trained</p>

<p>To offices of tender courtesy.</p>

<p>We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>I have possessed your Grace of what I purpose,</p>

<p>And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn</p>

<p>To have the due and forfeit of my bond.</p>

<p>If you deny it, let the danger light</p>

<p>Upon your charter and your city’s freedom!</p>

<p>You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have</p>

<p>A weight of carrion flesh than to receive</p>

<p>Three thousand ducats. I’ll not answer that,</p>

<p>But say it is my humor. Is it answered?</p>

<p>What if my house be troubled with a rat,</p>

<p>And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats</p>

<p>To have it baned? What, are you answered yet?</p>

<p>Some men there are love not a gaping pig,</p>

<p>Some that are mad if they behold a cat,</p>

<p>And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ th’ nose,</p>

<p>Cannot contain their urine; for affection</p>

<p>Masters oft passion, sways it to the mood</p>

<p>Of what it likes or loathes. Now for your answer:</p>

<p>As there is no firm reason to be rendered</p>

<p>Why he cannot abide a gaping pig,</p>

<p>Why he a harmless necessary cat,</p>

<p>Why he a woolen bagpipe, but of force</p>

<p>Must yield to such inevitable shame</p>

<p>As to offend, himself being offended,</p>

<p>So can I give no reason, nor I will not,</p>

<p>More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing</p>

<p>I bear Antonio, that I follow thus</p>

<p>A losing suit against him. Are you answered?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,</p>

<p>To excuse the current of thy cruelty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>I am not bound to please thee with my answers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Do all men kill the things they do not love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Hates any man the thing he would not kill?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Every offence is not a hate at first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc> <i>[to Bassanio]</i></p>

<p>I pray you, think you question with the Jew.</p>

<p>You may as well go stand upon the beach</p>

<p>And bid the main flood bate his usual height;</p>

<p>You may as well use question with the wolf</p>

<p>Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;</p>

<p>You may as well forbid the mountain pines</p>

<p>To wag their high tops and to make no noise</p>

<p>When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;</p>

<p>You may as well do anything most hard</p>

<p>As seek to soften that than which what’s harder?–</p>

<p>His Jewish heart. Therefore I do beseech you</p>

<p>Make no more offers, use no farther means,</p>

<p>But with all brief and plain conveniency</p>

<p>Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>For thy three thousand ducats here is six.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>If every ducat in six thousand ducats</p>

<p>Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,</p>

<p>I would not draw them. I would have my bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend’ring none?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?</p>

<p>You have among you many a purchased slave,</p>

<p>Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,</p>

<p>You use in abject and in slavish parts</p>

<p>Because you bought them. Shall I say to you</p>

<p>“Let them be free! Marry them to your heirs!</p>

<p>Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds</p>

<p>Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates</p>

<p>Be seasoned with such viands”? You will answer</p>

<p>“The slaves are ours!” So do I answer you:</p>

<p>The pound of flesh which I demand of him</p>

<p>Is dearly bought; ’tis mine and I will have it.</p>

<p>If you deny me, fie upon your law:</p>

<p>There is no force in the decrees of Venice.</p>

<p>I stand for judgment. Answer: shall I have it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Upon my power I may dismiss this court</p>

<p>Unless Bellario, a learned doctor</p>

<p>Whom I have sent for to determine this,</p>

<p>Come here today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salerio</sc>  My lord, here stays without</p>

<p>A messenger with letters from the doctor,</p>

<p>New come from Padua.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Bring us the letters. Call the messenger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!</p>

<p>The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all</p>

<p>Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>I am a tainted wether of the flock,</p>

<p>Meetest for death. The weakest kind of fruit</p>

<p>Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.</p>

<p>You cannot better be employed, Bassanio,</p>

<p>Than to live still and write mine epitaph.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Nerissa, disguised as a lawyer’s clerk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Came you from Padua, from Bellario?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nerissa</sc> <i>[as Clerk]</i></p>

<p>From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.</p>

<p><center><i>[Handing him a paper, which he reads, aside, while</p>

<p>Shylock sharpens his knife on the sole of his shoe.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>To cut the forfeiture from that bankrout there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>Not on thy sole but on thy soul, harsh Jew,</p>

<p>Thou mak’st thy knife keen. But no metal can,</p>

<p>No, not the hangman’s axe, bear half the keenness</p>

<p>Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>O, be thou damned, inexecrable dog,</p>

<p>And for thy life let justice be accused;</p>

<p>Thou almost mak’st me waver in my faith,</p>

<p>To hold opinion with Pythagoras</p>

<p>That souls of animals infuse themselves</p>

<p>Into the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit</p>

<p>Governed a wolf who, hanged for human slaughter,</p>

<p>Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,</p>

<p>And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,</p>

<p>Infused itself in thee, for thy desires</p>

<p>Are wolfish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,</p>

<p>Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud.</p>

<p>Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall</p>

<p>To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>This letter from Bellario doth commend</p>

<p>A young and learned doctor to our court.</p>

<p>Where is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nerissa</sc> <i>[as Clerk]</i>  He attendeth here hard by</p>

<p>To know your answer whether you’ll admit him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>With all my heart.–Some three or four of you</p>

<p>Go give him courteous conduct to this place.</p>

<p><center><i>[Attendants exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.</p>

<p><center><i>[He reads.]</i></center></p>

<p>Your Grace shall understand that, at the receipt of</p>

<p>your letter, I am very sick, but in the instant that your</p>

<p>messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a</p>

<p>young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I</p>

<p>acquainted him with the cause in controversy between</p>

<p>the Jew and Antonio the merchant. We turned o’er</p>

<p>many books together. He is furnished with my opinion,</p>

<p>which, bettered with his own learning (the greatness</p>

<p>whereof I cannot enough commend), comes with</p>

<p>him at my importunity to fill up your Grace’s request</p>

<p>in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no</p>

<p>impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I</p>

<p>never knew so young a body with so old a head. I</p>

<p>leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial</p>

<p>shall better publish his commendation.</p>

<br/>

<p>You hear the learned Bellario what he writes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Portia for Balthazar, disguised as a doctor of</p>

<p>laws, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>And here I take it is the doctor come.–</p>

<p>Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>I did, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  You are welcome. Take your place.</p>

<p>Are you acquainted with the difference</p>

<p>That holds this present question in the court?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>I am informed throughly of the cause.</p>

<p>Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Is your name Shylock?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Shylock is my name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Of a strange nature is the suit you follow,</p>

<p>Yet in such rule that the Venetian law</p>

<p>Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.</p>

<p><i>[To Antonio.]</i> You stand within his danger, do you</p>

<p>not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Ay, so he says.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i>  Do you confess the bond?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i>  Then must the Jew be merciful.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>The quality of mercy is not strained.</p>

<p>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</p>

<p>Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:</p>

<p>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.</p>

<p>’Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes</p>

<p>The throned monarch better than his crown.</p>

<p>His scepter shows the force of temporal power,</p>

<p>The attribute to awe and majesty</p>

<p>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;</p>

<p>But mercy is above this sceptered sway.</p>

<p>It is enthroned in the hearts of kings;</p>

<p>It is an attribute to God Himself;</p>

<p>And earthly power doth then show likest God’s</p>

<p>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</p>

<p>Though justice be thy plea, consider this:</p>

<p>That in the course of justice none of us</p>

<p>Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,</p>

<p>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render</p>

<p>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much</p>

<p>To mitigate the justice of thy plea,</p>

<p>Which, if thou follow, this strict court of Venice</p>

<p>Must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant</p>

<p>there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,</p>

<p>The penalty and forfeit of my bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Is he not able to discharge the money?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Yes. Here I tender it for him in the court,</p>

<p>Yea, twice the sum. If that will not suffice,</p>

<p>I will be bound to pay it ten times o’er</p>

<p>On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.</p>

<p>If this will not suffice, it must appear</p>

<p>That malice bears down truth. <i>[To the Duke.]</i> And I</p>

<p>beseech you,</p>

<p>Wrest once the law to your authority.</p>

<p>To do a great right, do a little wrong,</p>

<p>And curb this cruel devil of his will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>It must not be. There is no power in Venice</p>

<p>Can alter a decree established;</p>

<p>’Twill be recorded for a precedent</p>

<p>And many an error by the same example</p>

<p>Will rush into the state. It cannot be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel.</p>

<p>O wise young judge, how I do honor thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>I pray you let me look upon the bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.</p>

<p><center><i>[Handing Portia a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven!</p>

<p>Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?</p>

<p>No, not for Venice!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i>  Why, this bond is forfeit,</p>

<p>And lawfully by this the Jew may claim</p>

<p>A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off</p>

<p>Nearest the merchant’s heart.–Be merciful;</p>

<p>Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>When it is paid according to the tenor.</p>

<p>It doth appear you are a worthy judge;</p>

<p>You know the law; your exposition</p>

<p>Hath been most sound. I charge you by the law,</p>

<p>Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,</p>

<p>Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear</p>

<p>There is no power in the tongue of man</p>

<p>To alter me. I stay here on my bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>Most heartily I do beseech the court</p>

<p>To give the judgment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i>  Why, then, thus it is:</p>

<p>You must prepare your bosom for his knife–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>O noble judge! O excellent young man!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>For the intent and purpose of the law</p>

<p>Hath full relation to the penalty,</p>

<p>Which here appeareth due upon the bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>’Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,</p>

<p>How much more elder art thou than thy looks!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar, to Antonio]</i></p>

<p>Therefore lay bare your bosom–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Ay, his breast!</p>

<p>So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?</p>

<p>“Nearest his heart.” Those are the very words.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>It is so.</p>

<p>Are there balance here to weigh the flesh?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  I have them ready.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,</p>

<p>To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Is it so nominated in the bond?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>It is not so expressed, but what of that?</p>

<p>’Twere good you do so much for charity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>I cannot find it. ’Tis not in the bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>You, merchant, have you anything to say?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>But little. I am armed and well prepared.–</p>

<p>Give me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well.</p>

<p>Grieve not that I am fall’n to this for you,</p>

<p>For herein Fortune shows herself more kind</p>

<p>Than is her custom: it is still her use</p>

<p>To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,</p>

<p>To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow</p>

<p>An age of poverty, from which ling’ring penance</p>

<p>Of such misery doth she cut me off.</p>

<p>Commend me to your honorable wife,</p>

<p>Tell her the process of Antonio’s end,</p>

<p>Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death,</p>

<p>And when the tale is told, bid her be judge</p>

<p>Whether Bassanio had not once a love.</p>

<p>Repent but you that you shall lose your friend</p>

<p>And he repents not that he pays your debt.</p>

<p>For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,</p>

<p>I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Antonio, I am married to a wife</p>

<p>Which is as dear to me as life itself,</p>

<p>But life itself, my wife, and all the world</p>

<p>Are not with me esteemed above thy life.</p>

<p>I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all</p>

<p>Here to this devil, to deliver you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Your wife would give you little thanks for that</p>

<p>If she were by to hear you make the offer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>I have a wife who I protest I love.</p>

<p>I would she were in heaven, so she could</p>

<p>Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nerissa</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>’Tis well you offer it behind her back.</p>

<p>The wish would make else an unquiet house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>These be the Christian husbands! I have a</p>

<p>daughter–</p>

<p>Would any of the stock of Barabbas</p>

<p>Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!</p>

<p>We trifle time. I pray thee, pursue sentence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>A pound of that same merchant’s flesh is thine:</p>

<p>The court awards it, and the law doth give it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Most rightful judge!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:</p>

<p>The law allows it, and the court awards it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Most learned judge! A sentence!–Come, prepare.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Tarry a little. There is something else.</p>

<p>This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.</p>

<p>The words expressly are “a pound of flesh.”</p>

<p>Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,</p>

<p>But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed</p>

<p>One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods</p>

<p>Are by the laws of Venice confiscate</p>

<p>Unto the state of Venice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>O upright judge!–Mark, Jew.–O learned judge!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Is that the law?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i>  Thyself shalt see the act.</p>

<p>For, as thou urgest justice, be assured</p>

<p>Thou shalt have justice more than thou desir’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>O learned judge!–Mark, Jew, a learned judge!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>I take this offer then. Pay the bond thrice</p>

<p>And let the Christian go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  Here is the money.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Soft! The Jew shall have all justice. Soft, no haste!</p>

<p>He shall have nothing but the penalty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>O Jew, an upright judge, a learned judge!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.</p>

<p>Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more</p>

<p>But just a pound of flesh. If thou tak’st more</p>

<p>Or less than a just pound, be it but so much</p>

<p>As makes it light or heavy in the substance</p>

<p>Or the division of the twentieth part</p>

<p>Of one poor scruple–nay, if the scale do turn</p>

<p>But in the estimation of a hair,</p>

<p>Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>A second Daniel! A Daniel, Jew!</p>

<p>Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Give me my principal and let me go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>I have it ready for thee. Here it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>He hath refused it in the open court.</p>

<p>He shall have merely justice and his bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>A Daniel still, say I! A second Daniel!–</p>

<p>I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Shall I not have barely my principal?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture</p>

<p>To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Why, then, the devil give him good of it!</p>

<p>I’ll stay no longer question.     <i><i>[He begins to exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i>  Tarry, Jew.</p>

<p>The law hath yet another hold on you.</p>

<p>It is enacted in the laws of Venice,</p>

<p>If it be proved against an alien</p>

<p>That by direct or indirect attempts</p>

<p>He seek the life of any citizen,</p>

<p>The party ’gainst the which he doth contrive</p>

<p>Shall seize one half his goods; the other half</p>

<p>Comes to the privy coffer of the state,</p>

<p>And the offender’s life lies in the mercy</p>

<p>Of the Duke only, ’gainst all other voice.</p>

<p>In which predicament I say thou stand’st,</p>

<p>For it appears by manifest proceeding</p>

<p>That indirectly, and directly too,</p>

<p>Thou hast contrived against the very life</p>

<p>Of the defendant, and thou hast incurred</p>

<p>The danger formerly by me rehearsed.</p>

<p>Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself!</p>

<p>And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,</p>

<p>Thou hast not left the value of a cord;</p>

<p>Therefore thou must be hanged at the state’s</p>

<p>charge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,</p>

<p>I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.</p>

<p>For half thy wealth, it is Antonio’s;</p>

<p>The other half comes to the general state,</p>

<p>Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>Nay, take my life and all. Pardon not that.</p>

<p>You take my house when you do take the prop</p>

<p>That doth sustain my house; you take my life</p>

<p>When you do take the means whereby I live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>What mercy can you render him, Antonio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>A halter gratis, nothing else, for God’s sake!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>So please my lord the Duke and all the court</p>

<p>To quit the fine for one half of his goods,</p>

<p>I am content, so he will let me have</p>

<p>The other half in use, to render it</p>

<p>Upon his death unto the gentleman</p>

<p>That lately stole his daughter.</p>

<p>Two things provided more: that for this favor</p>

<p>He presently become a Christian;</p>

<p>The other, that he do record a gift,</p>

<p>Here in the court, of all he dies possessed</p>

<p>Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>He shall do this, or else I do recant</p>

<p>The pardon that I late pronounced here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>I am content.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i>  Clerk, draw a deed of gift.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc></p>

<p>I pray you give me leave to go from hence.</p>

<p>I am not well. Send the deed after me</p>

<p>And I will sign it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Get thee gone, but do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>In christ’ning shalt thou have two godfathers.</p>

<p>Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,</p>

<p>To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.</p>

<p><center><i>[Shylock exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[to Portia as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon.</p>

<p>I must away this night toward Padua,</p>

<p>And it is meet I presently set forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.–</p>

<p>Antonio, gratify this gentleman,</p>

<p>For in my mind you are much bound to him.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Duke and his train exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc> <i>[to Portia as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend</p>

<p>Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted</p>

<p>Of grievous penalties, in lieu whereof</p>

<p>Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew</p>

<p>We freely cope your courteous pains withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>And stand indebted, over and above,</p>

<p>In love and service to you evermore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>He is well paid that is well satisfied,</p>

<p>And I, delivering you, am satisfied,</p>

<p>And therein do account myself well paid.</p>

<p>My mind was never yet more mercenary.</p>

<p>I pray you know me when we meet again.</p>

<p>I wish you well, and so I take my leave.</p>

<p><center><i>[She begins to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further.</p>

<p>Take some remembrance of us as a tribute,</p>

<p>Not as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you:</p>

<p>Not to deny me, and to pardon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>You press me far, and therefore I will yield.</p>

<p>Give me your gloves; I’ll wear them for your sake–</p>

<p>And for your love I’ll take this ring from you.</p>

<p>Do not draw back your hand; I’ll take no more,</p>

<p>And you in love shall not deny me this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>This ring, good sir? Alas, it is a trifle.</p>

<p>I will not shame myself to give you this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>I will have nothing else but only this.</p>

<p>And now methinks I have a mind to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>There’s more depends on this than on the value.</p>

<p>The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,</p>

<p>And find it out by proclamation.</p>

<p>Only for this, I pray you pardon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>I see, sir, you are liberal in offers.</p>

<p>You taught me first to beg, and now methinks</p>

<p>You teach me how a beggar should be answered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife,</p>

<p>And when she put it on, she made me vow</p>

<p>That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[as Balthazar]</i></p>

<p>That ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts.</p>

<p>And if your wife be not a madwoman,</p>

<p>And know how well I have deserved this ring,</p>

<p>She would not hold out enemy forever</p>

<p>For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Portia and Nerissa exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antonio</sc></p>

<p>My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.</p>

<p>Let his deservings and my love withal</p>

<p>Be valued ’gainst your wife’s commandment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him.</p>

<p>Give him the ring, and bring him if thou canst</p>

<p>Unto Antonio’s house. Away, make haste.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gratiano exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Come, you and I will thither presently,</p>

<p>And in the morning early will we both</p>

<p>Fly toward Belmont.–Come, Antonio.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
