<p><center><i>[Enter Bassanio, Portia, and all their trains, Gratiano,</p>

<p>Nerissa.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>I pray you tarry, pause a day or two</p>

<p>Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong</p>

<p>I lose your company; therefore forbear a while.</p>

<p>There’s something tells me (but it is not love)</p>

<p>I would not lose you, and you know yourself</p>

<p>Hate counsels not in such a quality.</p>

<p>But lest you should not understand me well</p>

<p>(And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought)</p>

<p>I would detain you here some month or two</p>

<p>Before you venture for me. I could teach you</p>

<p>How to choose right, but then I am forsworn.</p>

<p>So will I never be. So may you miss me.</p>

<p>But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin,</p>

<p>That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,</p>

<p>They have o’erlooked me and divided me.</p>

<p>One half of me is yours, the other half yours–</p>

<p>Mine own, I would say–but if mine, then yours,</p>

<p>And so all yours. O, these naughty times</p>

<p>Puts bars between the owners and their rights!</p>

<p>And so though yours, not yours. Prove it so,</p>

<p>Let Fortune go to hell for it, not I.</p>

<p>I speak too long, but ’tis to peize the time,</p>

<p>To eche it, and to draw it out in length,</p>

<p>To stay you from election.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  Let me choose,</p>

<p>For as I am, I live upon the rack.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>Upon the rack, Bassanio? Then confess</p>

<p>What treason there is mingled with your love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>None but that ugly treason of mistrust,</p>

<p>Which makes me fear th’ enjoying of my love.</p>

<p>There may as well be amity and life</p>

<p>’Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack</p>

<p>Where men enforced do speak anything.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Promise me life and I’ll confess the truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>Well, then, confess and live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  “Confess and love”</p>

<p>Had been the very sum of my confession.</p>

<p>O happy torment, when my torturer</p>

<p>Doth teach me answers for deliverance!</p>

<p>But let me to my fortune and the caskets.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>Away, then. I am locked in one of them.</p>

<p>If you do love me, you will find me out.–</p>

<p>Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.</p>

<p>Let music sound while he doth make his choice.</p>

<p>Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end,</p>

<p>Fading in music. That the comparison</p>

<p>May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream</p>

<p>And wat’ry deathbed for him. He may win,</p>

<p>And what is music then? Then music is</p>

<p>Even as the flourish when true subjects bow</p>

<p>To a new-crowned monarch. Such it is</p>

<p>As are those dulcet sounds in break of day</p>

<p>That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear</p>

<p>And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,</p>

<p>With no less presence but with much more love</p>

<p>Than young Alcides when he did redeem</p>

<p>The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy</p>

<p>To the sea-monster. I stand for sacrifice;</p>

<p>The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,</p>

<p>With bleared visages, come forth to view</p>

<p>The issue of th’ exploit. Go, Hercules!</p>

<p>Live thou, I live. With much much more dismay</p>

<p>I view the fight than thou that mak’st the fray.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[A song the whilst Bassanio comments on</p>

<p>the caskets to himself.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>     <i>Tell me where is fancy bred,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Or in the heart, or in the head?</i></p>

<p>     <i>How begot, how nourished?</i></p>

<p>        <i>Reply, reply.</i></p>

<p>     <i>It is engendered in the eye,</i></p>

<p>     <i>With gazing fed, and fancy dies</i></p>

<p>     <i>In the cradle where it lies.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Let us all ring fancy’s knell.</i></p>

<p>     <i>I’ll begin it.–Ding, dong, bell.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>     <i>Ding, dong, bell.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>So may the outward shows be least themselves;</p>

<p>The world is still deceived with ornament.</p>

<p>In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt</p>

<p>But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,</p>

<p>Obscures the show of evil? In religion,</p>

<p>What damned error but some sober brow</p>

<p>Will bless it and approve it with a text,</p>

<p>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?</p>

<p>There is no vice so simple but assumes</p>

<p>Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.</p>

<p>How many cowards whose hearts are all as false</p>

<p>As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins</p>

<p>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,</p>

<p>Who inward searched have livers white as milk,</p>

<p>And these assume but valor’s excrement</p>

<p>To render them redoubted. Look on beauty,</p>

<p>And you shall see ’tis purchased by the weight,</p>

<p>Which therein works a miracle in nature,</p>

<p>Making them lightest that wear most of it.</p>

<p>So are those crisped snaky golden locks,</p>

<p>Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind</p>

<p>Upon supposed fairness, often known</p>

<p>To be the dowry of a second head,</p>

<p>The skull that bred them in the sepulcher.</p>

<p>Thus ornament is but the guiled shore</p>

<p>To a most dangerous sea, the beauteous scarf</p>

<p>Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,</p>

<p>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</p>

<p>To entrap the wisest. Therefore, then, thou gaudy</p>

<p>gold,</p>

<p>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee.</p>

<p>Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge</p>

<p>’Tween man and man. But thou, thou meager lead,</p>

<p>Which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught,</p>

<p>Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence,</p>

<p>And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!</p>

<p><center><i>[Bassanio is given a key.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>How all the other passions fleet to air,</p>

<p>As doubtful thoughts and rash embraced despair,</p>

<p>And shudd’ring fear, and green-eyed jealousy!</p>

<p>O love, be moderate, allay thy ecstasy,</p>

<p>In measure rain thy joy, scant this excess!</p>

<p>I feel too much thy blessing. Make it less,</p>

<p>For fear I surfeit.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bassanio opens the lead casket.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  What find I here?</p>

<p>Fair Portia’s counterfeit! What demigod</p>

<p>Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?</p>

<p>Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,</p>

<p>Seem they in motion? Here are severed lips</p>

<p>Parted with sugar breath; so sweet a bar</p>

<p>Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs</p>

<p>The painter plays the spider, and hath woven</p>

<p>A golden mesh t’ entrap the hearts of men</p>

<p>Faster than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes!</p>

<p>How could he see to do them? Having made one,</p>

<p>Methinks it should have power to steal both his</p>

<p>And leave itself unfurnished. Yet look how far</p>

<p>The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow</p>

<p>In underprizing it, so far this shadow</p>

<p>Doth limp behind the substance. Here’s the scroll,</p>

<p>The continent and summary of my fortune.</p>

<p><center><i>[He reads the scroll.]</i></center></p>

<p>     <i>You that choose not by the view</i></p>

<p>     <i>Chance as fair and choose as true.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Since this fortune falls to you,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Be content and seek no new.</i></p>

<p>     <i>If you be well pleased with this</i></p>

<p>     <i>And hold your fortune for your bliss,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Turn you where your lady is,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And claim her with a loving kiss.</i></p>

<p>A gentle scroll! Fair lady, by your leave,</p>

<p>I come by note to give and to receive.</p>

<p>Like one of two contending in a prize</p>

<p>That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes,</p>

<p>Hearing applause and universal shout,</p>

<p>Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt</p>

<p>Whether those peals of praise be his or no,</p>

<p>So, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so,</p>

<p>As doubtful whether what I see be true,</p>

<p>Until confirmed, signed, ratified by you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,</p>

<p>Such as I am. Though for myself alone</p>

<p>I would not be ambitious in my wish</p>

<p>To wish myself much better, yet for you</p>

<p>I would be trebled twenty times myself,</p>

<p>A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times</p>

<p>More rich, that only to stand high in your account</p>

<p>I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,</p>

<p>Exceed account. But the full sum of me</p>

<p>Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,</p>

<p>Is an unlessoned girl, unschooled, unpracticed;</p>

<p>Happy in this, she is not yet so old</p>

<p>But she may learn; happier than this,</p>

<p>She is not bred so dull but she can learn;</p>

<p>Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit</p>

<p>Commits itself to yours to be directed</p>

<p>As from her lord, her governor, her king.</p>

<p>Myself, and what is mine, to you and yours</p>

<p>Is now converted. But now I was the lord</p>

<p>Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,</p>

<p>Queen o’er myself; and even now, but now,</p>

<p>This house, these servants, and this same myself</p>

<p>Are yours, my lord’s. I give them with this ring,</p>

<p><center><i>[Handing him a ring.]</i></center></p>

<p>Which, when you part from, lose, or give away,</p>

<p>Let it presage the ruin of your love,</p>

<p>And be my vantage to exclaim on you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Madam, you have bereft me of all words.</p>

<p>Only my blood speaks to you in my veins,</p>

<p>And there is such confusion in my powers</p>

<p>As after some oration fairly spoke</p>

<p>By a beloved prince there doth appear</p>

<p>Among the buzzing pleased multitude,</p>

<p>Where every something being blent together</p>

<p>Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy</p>

<p>Expressed and not expressed. But when this ring</p>

<p>Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence.</p>

<p>O, then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nerissa</sc></p>

<p>My lord and lady, it is now our time,</p>

<p>That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,</p>

<p>To cry “Good joy, good joy, my lord and lady!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,</p>

<p>I wish you all the joy that you can wish,</p>

<p>For I am sure you can wish none from me.</p>

<p>And when your honors mean to solemnize</p>

<p>The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you</p>

<p>Even at that time I may be married too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>I thank your Lordship, you have got me one.</p>

<p>My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:</p>

<p>You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid.</p>

<p>You loved, I loved; for intermission</p>

<p>No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.</p>

<p>Your fortune stood upon the caskets there,</p>

<p>And so did mine, too, as the matter falls.</p>

<p>For wooing here until I sweat again,</p>

<p>And swearing till my very roof was dry</p>

<p>With oaths of love, at last (if promise last)</p>

<p>I got a promise of this fair one here</p>

<p>To have her love, provided that your fortune</p>

<p>Achieved her mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc>  Is this true, Nerissa?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nerissa</sc></p>

<p>Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  Yes, faith, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  We’ll play with them the first boy for a</p>

<p>thousand ducats.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nerissa</sc>  What, and stake down?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  No, we shall ne’er win at that sport and</p>

<p>stake down.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lorenzo, Jessica, and Salerio, a messenger</p>

<p>from Venice.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?</p>

<p>What, and my old Venetian friend Salerio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither–</p>

<p>If that the youth of my new int’rest here</p>

<p>Have power to bid you welcome. <i>[To Portia.]</i> By</p>

<p>your leave,</p>

<p>I bid my very friends and countrymen,</p>

<p>Sweet Portia, welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>So do I, my lord. They are entirely welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lorenzo</sc> <i>[to Bassanio]</i></p>

<p>I thank your Honor. For my part, my lord,</p>

<p>My purpose was not to have seen you here,</p>

<p>But meeting with Salerio by the way,</p>

<p>He did entreat me past all saying nay</p>

<p>To come with him along.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salerio</sc>  I did, my lord,</p>

<p>And I have reason for it.     <i><i>[Handing him a paper.]</i></i></p>

<p>Signior Antonio</p>

<p>Commends him to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  Ere I ope his letter,</p>

<p>I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salerio</sc></p>

<p>Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,</p>

<p>Nor well, unless in mind. His letter there</p>

<p>Will show you his estate.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bassanio opens the letter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>Nerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome.–</p>

<p>Your hand, Salerio. What’s the news from Venice?</p>

<p>How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?</p>

<p>I know he will be glad of our success.</p>

<p>We are the Jasons, we have won the Fleece.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salerio</sc></p>

<p>I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>There are some shrewd contents in yond same</p>

<p>paper</p>

<p>That steals the color from Bassanio’s cheek.</p>

<p>Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world</p>

<p>Could turn so much the constitution</p>

<p>Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?–</p>

<p>With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,</p>

<p>And I must freely have the half of anything</p>

<p>That this same paper brings you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc>  O sweet Portia,</p>

<p>Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words</p>

<p>That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,</p>

<p>When I did first impart my love to you,</p>

<p>I freely told you all the wealth I had</p>

<p>Ran in my veins: I was a gentleman.</p>

<p>And then I told you true; and yet, dear lady,</p>

<p>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</p>

<p>How much I was a braggart. When I told you</p>

<p>My state was nothing, I should then have told you</p>

<p>That I was worse than nothing; for indeed</p>

<p>I have engaged myself to a dear friend,</p>

<p>Engaged my friend to his mere enemy</p>

<p>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,</p>

<p>The paper as the body of my friend,</p>

<p>And every word in it a gaping wound</p>

<p>Issuing life blood.–But is it true, Salerio?</p>

<p>Hath all his ventures failed? What, not one hit?</p>

<p>From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,</p>

<p>From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,</p>

<p>And not one vessel ’scape the dreadful touch</p>

<p>Of merchant-marring rocks?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salerio</sc>  Not one, my lord.</p>

<p>Besides, it should appear that if he had</p>

<p>The present money to discharge the Jew,</p>

<p>He would not take it. Never did I know</p>

<p>A creature that did bear the shape of man</p>

<p>So keen and greedy to confound a man.</p>

<p>He plies the Duke at morning and at night,</p>

<p>And doth impeach the freedom of the state</p>

<p>If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,</p>

<p>The Duke himself, and the magnificoes</p>

<p>Of greatest port have all persuaded with him,</p>

<p>But none can drive him from the envious plea</p>

<p>Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jessica</sc></p>

<p>When I was with him, I have heard him swear</p>

<p>To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,</p>

<p>That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh</p>

<p>Than twenty times the value of the sum</p>

<p>That he did owe him. And I know, my lord,</p>

<p>If law, authority, and power deny not,</p>

<p>It will go hard with poor Antonio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,</p>

<p>The best conditioned and unwearied spirit</p>

<p>In doing courtesies, and one in whom</p>

<p>The ancient Roman honor more appears</p>

<p>Than any that draws breath in Italy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc>  What sum owes he the Jew?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>For me, three thousand ducats.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc>  What, no more?</p>

<p>Pay him six thousand and deface the bond.</p>

<p>Double six thousand and then treble that,</p>

<p>Before a friend of this description</p>

<p>Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault.</p>

<p>First go with me to church and call me wife,</p>

<p>And then away to Venice to your friend!</p>

<p>For never shall you lie by Portia’s side</p>

<p>With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold</p>

<p>To pay the petty debt twenty times over.</p>

<p>When it is paid, bring your true friend along.</p>

<p>My maid Nerissa and myself meantime</p>

<p>Will live as maids and widows. Come, away,</p>

<p>For you shall hence upon your wedding day.</p>

<p>Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;</p>

<p>Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.</p>

<p>But let me hear the letter of your friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc> <i>[reads]</i></p>

<p>Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my</p>

<p>creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to</p>

<p>the Jew is forfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible</p>

<p>I should live, all debts are cleared between you and I if</p>

<p>I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use</p>

<p>your pleasure. If your love do not persuade you to</p>

<p>come, let not my letter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Portia</sc></p>

<p>O love, dispatch all business and begone!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bassanio</sc></p>

<p>Since I have your good leave to go away,</p>

<p>I will make haste. But till I come again,</p>

<p>No bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay,</p>

<p>Nor rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.</p>
