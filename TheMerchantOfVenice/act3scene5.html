<p><center><i>[Enter Lancelet, the Clown, and Jessica.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father</p>

<p>are to be laid upon the children. Therefore I</p>

<p>promise you I fear you. I was always plain with you,</p>

<p>and so now I speak my agitation of the matter.</p>

<p>Therefore be o’ good cheer, for truly I think you</p>

<p>are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do</p>

<p>you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope</p>

<p>neither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span>  And what hope is that, I pray thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  Marry, you may partly hope that your father</p>

<p>got you not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span>  That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so</p>

<p>the sins of my mother should be visited upon me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  Truly, then, I fear you are damned both by</p>

<p>father and mother; thus when I shun Scylla your</p>

<p>father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you</p>

<p>are gone both ways.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span>  I shall be saved by my husband. He hath made</p>

<p>me a Christian.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  Truly the more to blame he! We were Christians</p>

<p>enow before, e’en as many as could well live</p>

<p>one by another. This making of Christians will</p>

<p>raise the price of hogs. If we grow all to be pork</p>

<p>eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the</p>

<p>coals for money.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lorenzo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span>  I’ll tell my husband, Lancelet, what you say.</p>

<p>Here he comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Lancelet,</p>

<p>if you thus get my wife into corners!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span>  Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Lancelet</p>

<p>and I are out. He tells me flatly there’s no mercy for</p>

<p>me in heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter; and</p>

<p>he says you are no good member of the commonwealth,</p>

<p>for in converting Jews to Christians you</p>

<p>raise the price of pork.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  I shall answer that better to the commonwealth</p>

<p>than you can the getting up of the Negro’s</p>

<p>belly! The Moor is with child by you, Lancelet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  It is much that the Moor should be more</p>

<p>than reason; but if she be less than an honest</p>

<p>woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  How every fool can play upon the word! I</p>

<p>think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into</p>

<p>silence, and discourse grow commendable in none</p>

<p>only but parrots. Go in, sirrah, bid them prepare for</p>

<p>dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  That is done, sir. They have all stomachs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you!</p>

<p>Then bid them prepare dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  That is done too, sir, only “cover” is the</p>

<p>word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  Will you cover, then, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  Not so, sir, neither! I know my duty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  Yet more quarreling with occasion! Wilt</p>

<p>thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an</p>

<p>instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his</p>

<p>plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover the</p>

<p>table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to</p>

<p>dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lancelet</span>  For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for</p>

<p>the meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in</p>

<p>to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humors and conceits</p>

<p>shall govern.     <i><i>[Lancelet exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span></p>

<p>O dear discretion, how his words are suited!</p>

<p>The fool hath planted in his memory</p>

<p>An army of good words, and I do know</p>

<p>A many fools that stand in better place,</p>

<p>Garnished like him, that for a tricksy word</p>

<p>Defy the matter. How cheer’st thou, Jessica?</p>

<p>And now, good sweet, say thy opinion</p>

<p>How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span></p>

<p>Past all expressing. It is very meet</p>

<p>The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,</p>

<p>For having such a blessing in his lady</p>

<p>He finds the joys of heaven here on Earth,</p>

<p>And if on Earth he do not merit it,</p>

<p>In reason he should never come to heaven.</p>

<p>Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,</p>

<p>And on the wager lay two earthly women,</p>

<p>And Portia one, there must be something else</p>

<p>Pawned with the other, for the poor rude world</p>

<p>Hath not her fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span>  Even such a husband</p>

<p>Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span></p>

<p>Nay, but ask my opinion too of that!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span></p>

<p>I will anon. First let us go to dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span></p>

<p>Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lorenzo</span></p>

<p>No, pray thee, let it serve for table talk.</p>

<p>Then howsome’er thou speak’st, ’mong other things</p>

<p>I shall digest it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jessica</span>  Well, I’ll set you forth.</p>
