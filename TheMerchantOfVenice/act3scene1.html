<p><center><i>[Enter Solanio and Salarino.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Solanio</sc>  Now, what news on the Rialto?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc>  Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio</p>

<p>hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the</p>

<p>Narrow Seas–the Goodwins, I think they call the</p>

<p>place–a very dangerous flat, and fatal, where the</p>

<p>carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say,</p>

<p>if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her</p>

<p>word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Solanio</sc>  I would she were as lying a gossip in that as</p>

<p>ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe</p>

<p>she wept for the death of a third husband. But</p>

<p>it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing</p>

<p>the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio,</p>

<p>the honest Antonio–O, that I had a title good</p>

<p>enough to keep his name company!–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc>  Come, the full stop.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Solanio</sc>  Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he</p>

<p>hath lost a ship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc>  I would it might prove the end of his losses.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Solanio</sc>  Let me say “amen” betimes, lest the devil</p>

<p>cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness</p>

<p>of a Jew.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Shylock.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Shylock, what news among the</p>

<p>merchants?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  You knew, none so well, none so well as you,</p>

<p>of my daughter’s flight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc>  That’s certain. I for my part knew the tailor</p>

<p>that made the wings she flew withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Solanio</sc>  And Shylock for his own part knew the bird</p>

<p>was fledge, and then it is the complexion of them</p>

<p>all to leave the dam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  She is damned for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc>  That’s certain, if the devil may be her judge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  My own flesh and blood to rebel!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Solanio</sc>  Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these</p>

<p>years?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc>  There is more difference between thy flesh</p>

<p>and hers than between jet and ivory, more between</p>

<p>your bloods than there is between red wine and</p>

<p>Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio</p>

<p>have had any loss at sea or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  There I have another bad match! A bankrout,</p>

<p>a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on</p>

<p>the Rialto, a beggar that was used to come so smug</p>

<p>upon the mart! Let him look to his bond. He was</p>

<p>wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond. He</p>

<p>was wont to lend money for a Christian cur’sy; let</p>

<p>him look to his bond.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc>  Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not</p>

<p>take his flesh! What’s that good for?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else,</p>

<p>it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and</p>

<p>hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses,</p>

<p>mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted</p>

<p>my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies–</p>

<p>and what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not</p>

<p>a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions,</p>

<p>senses, affections, passions? Fed with the</p>

<p>same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to</p>

<p>the same diseases, healed by the same means,</p>

<p>warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer</p>

<p>as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not</p>

<p>bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you</p>

<p>poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall</p>

<p>we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will</p>

<p>resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,</p>

<p>what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong</p>

<p>a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian</p>

<p>example? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I</p>

<p>will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the</p>

<p>instruction.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a man from Antonio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servingman</sc>  Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his</p>

<p>house and desires to speak with you both.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salarino</sc>  We have been up and down to seek him.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Tubal.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Solanio</sc>  Here comes another of the tribe; a third</p>

<p>cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn</p>

<p>Jew.</p>

<p><center><i>[Salarino, Solanio, and the Servingman exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa?</p>

<p>Hast thou found my daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tubal</sc>  I often came where I did hear of her, but</p>

<p>cannot find her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Why, there, there, there, there! A diamond</p>

<p>gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt!</p>

<p>The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I</p>

<p>never felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that,</p>

<p>and other precious, precious jewels! I would my</p>

<p>daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her</p>

<p>ear; would she were hearsed at my foot and the</p>

<p>ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And</p>

<p>I know not what’s spent in the search! Why, thou</p>

<p>loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so</p>

<p>much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no</p>

<p>revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights a’ my</p>

<p>shoulders, no sighs but a’ my breathing, no tears but</p>

<p>a’ my shedding.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tubal</sc>  Yes, other men have ill luck, too. Antonio, as I</p>

<p>heard in Genoa–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tubal</sc>  –hath an argosy cast away coming from</p>

<p>Tripolis.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  I thank God, I thank God! Is it true, is it true?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tubal</sc>  I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped</p>

<p>the wrack.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good</p>

<p>news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tubal</sc>  Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one</p>

<p>night fourscore ducats.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Thou stick’st a dagger in me. I shall never</p>

<p>see my gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting,</p>

<p>fourscore ducats!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tubal</sc>  There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my</p>

<p>company to Venice that swear he cannot choose</p>

<p>but break.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  I am very glad of it. I’ll plague him, I’ll</p>

<p>torture him. I am glad of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tubal</sc>  One of them showed me a ring that he had of</p>

<p>your daughter for a monkey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It</p>

<p>was my turquoise! I had it of Leah when I was a</p>

<p>bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness</p>

<p>of monkeys.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Tubal</sc>  But Antonio is certainly undone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Shylock</sc>  Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal,</p>

<p>fee me an officer. Bespeak him a fortnight before. I</p>

<p>will have the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he</p>

<p>out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will.</p>

<p>Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue. Go, good</p>

<p>Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.</p>
