<p><center><i>[Enter Antipholus of Syracuse, First Merchant, and</p>

<p>Dromio of Syracuse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>Therefore give out you are of Epidamium,</p>

<p>Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.</p>

<p>This very day a Syracusian merchant</p>

<p>Is apprehended for arrival here</p>

<p>And, not being able to buy out his life,</p>

<p>According to the statute of the town</p>

<p>Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.</p>

<p>There is your money that I had to keep.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives money.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span> <i>[handing money to Dromio]</i></p>

<p>Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,</p>

<p>And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.</p>

<p>Within this hour it will be dinnertime.</p>

<p>Till that, I’ll view the manners of the town,</p>

<p>Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,</p>

<p>And then return and sleep within mine inn,</p>

<p>For with long travel I am stiff and weary.</p>

<p>Get thee away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Many a man would take you at your word</p>

<p>And go indeed, having so good a mean.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dromio of Syracuse exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,</p>

<p>When I am dull with care and melancholy,</p>

<p>Lightens my humor with his merry jests.</p>

<p>What, will you walk with me about the town</p>

<p>And then go to my inn and dine with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,</p>

<p>Of whom I hope to make much benefit.</p>

<p>I crave your pardon. Soon at five o’clock,</p>

<p>Please you, I’ll meet with you upon the mart</p>

<p>And afterward consort you till bedtime.</p>

<p>My present business calls me from you now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Farewell till then. I will go lose myself</p>

<p>And wander up and down to view the city.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>Sir, I commend you to your own content.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>He that commends me to mine own content</p>

<p>Commends me to the thing I cannot get.</p>

<p>I to the world am like a drop of water</p>

<p>That in the ocean seeks another drop,</p>

<p>Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,</p>

<p>Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.</p>

<p>So I, to find a mother and a brother,</p>

<p>In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dromio of Ephesus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes the almanac of my true date.–</p>

<p>What now? How chance thou art returned so soon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>Returned so soon? Rather approached too late!</p>

<p>The capon burns; the pig falls from the spit;</p>

<p>The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;</p>

<p>My mistress made it one upon my cheek.</p>

<p>She is so hot because the meat is cold;</p>

<p>The meat is cold because you come not home;</p>

<p>You come not home because you have no stomach;</p>

<p>You have no stomach, having broke your fast.</p>

<p>But we that know what ’tis to fast and pray</p>

<p>Are penitent for your default today.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Stop in your wind, sir. Tell me this, I pray:</p>

<p>Where have you left the money that I gave you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>O, sixpence that I had o’ Wednesday last</p>

<p>To pay the saddler for my mistress’ crupper?</p>

<p>The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>I am not in a sportive humor now.</p>

<p>Tell me, and dally not: where is the money?</p>

<p>We being strangers here, how dar’st thou trust</p>

<p>So great a charge from thine own custody?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>I pray you, jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.</p>

<p>I from my mistress come to you in post;</p>

<p>If I return, I shall be post indeed,</p>

<p>For she will scour your fault upon my pate.</p>

<p>Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your</p>

<p>clock,</p>

<p>And strike you home without a messenger.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season.</p>

<p>Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.</p>

<p>Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,</p>

<p>And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>My charge was but to fetch you from the mart</p>

<p>Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.</p>

<p>My mistress and her sister stays for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Now, as I am a Christian, answer me</p>

<p>In what safe place you have bestowed my money,</p>

<p>Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours</p>

<p>That stands on tricks when I am undisposed.</p>

<p>Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>I have some marks of yours upon my pate,</p>

<p>Some of my mistress’ marks upon my shoulders,</p>

<p>But not a thousand marks between you both.</p>

<p>If I should pay your Worship those again,</p>

<p>Perchance you will not bear them patiently.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Thy mistress’ marks? What mistress, slave, hast</p>

<p>thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>Your Worship’s wife, my mistress at the Phoenix,</p>

<p>She that doth fast till you come home to dinner</p>

<p>And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span> <i>[beating Dromio]</i></p>

<p>What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,</p>

<p>Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>What mean you, sir? For God’s sake, hold your</p>

<p>hands.</p>

<p>Nay, an you will not, sir, I’ll take my heels.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dromio of Ephesus exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Upon my life, by some device or other</p>

<p>The villain is o’erraught of all my money.</p>

<p>They say this town is full of cozenage,</p>

<p>As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,</p>

<p>Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,</p>

<p>Soul-killing witches that deform the body,</p>

<p>Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,</p>

<p>And many suchlike liberties of sin.</p>

<p>If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.</p>

<p>I’ll to the Centaur to go seek this slave.</p>

<p>I greatly fear my money is not safe.</p>
