<p><center><i>[Enter Adriana and Luciana.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?</p>

<p>   <i>Might’st thou perceive austerely in his eye</i></p>

<p>That he did plead in earnest, yea or no?</p>

<p>   <i>Looked he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?</i></p>

<p>What observation mad’st thou in this case</p>

<p>Of his heart’s meteors tilting in his face?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>First he denied you had in him no right.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>He meant he did me none; the more my spite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Then swore he that he was a stranger here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Then pleaded I for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc>  And what said he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>That love I begged for you he begged of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>With words that in an honest suit might move.</p>

<p>First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Did’st speak him fair?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc>  Have patience, I beseech.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>I cannot, nor I will not hold me still.</p>

<p>My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.</p>

<p>He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,</p>

<p>Ill-faced, worse-bodied, shapeless everywhere,</p>

<p>Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind,</p>

<p>Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Who would be jealous, then, of such a one?</p>

<p>No evil lost is wailed when it is gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Ah, but I think him better than I say,</p>

<p>   <i>And yet would herein others’ eyes were worse.</i></p>

<p>Far from her nest the lapwing cries away.</p>

<p>   <i>My heart prays for him, though my tongue do</i></p>

<p>   <i>curse.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dromio of Syracuse with the key.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>Here, go–the desk, the purse! Sweet, now make</p>

<p>haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>How hast thou lost thy breath?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc>  By running fast.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.</p>

<p>A devil in an everlasting garment hath him,</p>

<p>One whose hard heart is buttoned up with steel;</p>

<p>A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;</p>

<p>A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;</p>

<p>A backfriend, a shoulder clapper, one that</p>

<p>countermands</p>

<p>The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;</p>

<p>A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot</p>

<p>well,</p>

<p>One that before the judgment carries poor souls to</p>

<p>hell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc>  Why, man, what is the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>I do not know the matter. He is ’rested on the case.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>I know not at whose suit he is arrested well,</p>

<p>But is in a suit of buff which ’rested him; that can I</p>

<p>tell.</p>

<p>Will you send him, mistress, redemption–the</p>

<p>money in his desk?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Go fetch it, sister. <i>[(Luciana exits.)]</i> This I wonder at,</p>

<p>That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.</p>

<p>Tell me, was he arrested on a band?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>Not on a band, but on a stronger thing:</p>

<p>A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc>  What, the chain?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>No, no, the bell. ’Tis time that I were gone.</p>

<p>It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes</p>

<p>one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>The hours come back. That did I never hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>O yes, if any hour meet a sergeant, he turns back</p>

<p>for very fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>As if time were in debt. How fondly dost thou</p>

<p>reason!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>Time is a very bankrout and owes more than he’s</p>

<p>worth to season.</p>

<p>Nay, he’s a thief too. Have you not heard men say</p>

<p>That time comes stealing on by night and day?</p>

<p>If he be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the</p>

<p>way,</p>

<p>Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Luciana, with the purse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Go, Dromio. There’s the money. Bear it straight,</p>

<p>And bring thy master home immediately.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dromio exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Come, sister, I am pressed down with conceit:</p>

<p>Conceit, my comfort and my injury.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
