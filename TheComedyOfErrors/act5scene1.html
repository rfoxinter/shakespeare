<p><center><i>[Enter the Second Merchant and Angelo the</p>

<p>Goldsmith.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>I am sorry, sir, that I have hindered you,</p>

<p>But I protest he had the chain of me,</p>

<p>Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Merchant</sc></p>

<p>How is the man esteemed here in the city?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>Of very reverend reputation, sir,</p>

<p>Of credit infinite, highly beloved,</p>

<p>Second to none that lives here in the city.</p>

<p>His word might bear my wealth at any time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Merchant</sc></p>

<p>Speak softly. Yonder, as I think, he walks.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse again,</p>

<p>Antipholus wearing the chain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>’Tis so, and that self chain about his neck</p>

<p>Which he forswore most monstrously to have.</p>

<p>Good sir, draw near to me. I’ll speak to him.–</p>

<p>Signior Antipholus, I wonder much</p>

<p>That you would put me to this shame and trouble,</p>

<p>And not without some scandal to yourself,</p>

<p>With circumstance and oaths so to deny</p>

<p>This chain, which now you wear so openly.</p>

<p>Besides the charge, the shame, imprisonment,</p>

<p>You have done wrong to this my honest friend,</p>

<p>Who, but for staying on our controversy,</p>

<p>Had hoisted sail and put to sea today.</p>

<p>This chain you had of me. Can you deny it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>I think I had. I never did deny it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Merchant</sc></p>

<p>Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Merchant</sc></p>

<p>These ears of mine, thou know’st, did hear thee.</p>

<p>Fie on thee, wretch. ’Tis pity that thou liv’st</p>

<p>To walk where any honest men resort.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>Thou art a villain to impeach me thus.</p>

<p>I’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty</p>

<p>Against thee presently if thou dar’st stand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Merchant</sc></p>

<p>I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.     <i><i>[They draw.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Hold, hurt him not, for God’s sake. He is mad.–</p>

<p>Some get within him; take his sword away.</p>

<p>Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>Run, master, run. For God’s sake, take a house.</p>

<p>This is some priory. In, or we are spoiled.</p>

<p><center><i>[Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse</p>

<p>exit to the Priory.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lady Abbess.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.</p>

<p>Let us come in, that we may bind him fast</p>

<p>And bear him home for his recovery.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>I knew he was not in his perfect wits.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Merchant</sc></p>

<p>I am sorry now that I did draw on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>How long hath this possession held the man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,</p>

<p>And much different from the man he was.</p>

<p>But till this afternoon his passion</p>

<p>Ne’er brake into extremity of rage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea?</p>

<p>Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye</p>

<p>Strayed his affection in unlawful love,</p>

<p>A sin prevailing much in youthful men</p>

<p>Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing?</p>

<p>Which of these sorrows is he subject to?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>To none of these, except it be the last,</p>

<p>Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>You should for that have reprehended him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Why, so I did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc>  Ay, but not rough enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>As roughly as my modesty would let me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>Haply in private.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc>  And in assemblies too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc>  Ay, but not enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>It was the copy of our conference.</p>

<p>In bed he slept not for my urging it;</p>

<p>At board he fed not for my urging it.</p>

<p>Alone, it was the subject of my theme;</p>

<p>In company I often glanced it.</p>

<p>Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>And thereof came it that the man was mad.</p>

<p>The venom clamors of a jealous woman</p>

<p>Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth.</p>

<p>It seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing,</p>

<p>And thereof comes it that his head is light.</p>

<p>Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy</p>

<p>upbraidings.</p>

<p>Unquiet meals make ill digestions.</p>

<p>Thereof the raging fire of fever bred,</p>

<p>And what’s a fever but a fit of madness?</p>

<p>Thou sayest his sports were hindered by thy brawls.</p>

<p>Sweet recreation barred, what doth ensue</p>

<p>But moody and dull melancholy,</p>

<p>Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,</p>

<p>And at her heels a huge infectious troop</p>

<p>Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?</p>

<p>In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest</p>

<p>To be disturbed would mad or man or beast.</p>

<p>The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits</p>

<p>Hath scared thy husband from the use of wits.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>She never reprehended him but mildly</p>

<p>When he demeaned himself rough, rude, and</p>

<p>wildly.–</p>

<p>Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>She did betray me to my own reproof.–</p>

<p>Good people, enter and lay hold on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>No, not a creature enters in my house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Then let your servants bring my husband forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>Neither. He took this place for sanctuary,</p>

<p>And it shall privilege him from your hands</p>

<p>Till I have brought him to his wits again</p>

<p>Or lose my labor in assaying it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>I will attend my husband, be his nurse,</p>

<p>Diet his sickness, for it is my office</p>

<p>And will have no attorney but myself;</p>

<p>And therefore let me have him home with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>Be patient, for I will not let him stir</p>

<p>Till I have used the approved means I have,</p>

<p>With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,</p>

<p>To make of him a formal man again.</p>

<p>It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,</p>

<p>A charitable duty of my order.</p>

<p>Therefore depart and leave him here with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>I will not hence and leave my husband here;</p>

<p>And ill it doth beseem your holiness</p>

<p>To separate the husband and the wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>Be quiet and depart. Thou shalt not have him.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc> <i>[to Adriana]</i></p>

<p>Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Come, go. I will fall prostrate at his feet</p>

<p>And never rise until my tears and prayers</p>

<p>Have won his grace to come in person hither</p>

<p>And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Merchant</sc></p>

<p>By this, I think, the dial points at five.</p>

<p>Anon, I’m sure, the Duke himself in person</p>

<p>Comes this way to the melancholy vale,</p>

<p>The place of death and sorry execution</p>

<p>Behind the ditches of the abbey here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  Upon what cause?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Merchant</sc></p>

<p>To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,</p>

<p>Who put unluckily into this bay</p>

<p>Against the laws and statutes of this town,</p>

<p>Beheaded publicly for his offense.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>See where they come. We will behold his death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc> <i>[to Adriana]</i></p>

<p>Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Duke of Ephesus, and Egeon the Merchant</p>

<p>of Syracuse, bare head, with the Headsman</p>

<p>and other Officers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Yet once again proclaim it publicly,</p>

<p>If any friend will pay the sum for him,</p>

<p>He shall not die; so much we tender him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Justice, most sacred duke, against the Abbess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>She is a virtuous and a reverend lady.</p>

<p>It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>May it please your Grace, Antipholus my husband,</p>

<p>Who I made lord of me and all I had</p>

<p>At your important letters, this ill day</p>

<p>A most outrageous fit of madness took him,</p>

<p>That desp’rately he hurried through the street,</p>

<p>With him his bondman, all as mad as he,</p>

<p>Doing displeasure to the citizens</p>

<p>By rushing in their houses, bearing thence</p>

<p>Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.</p>

<p>Once did I get him bound and sent him home</p>

<p>Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went</p>

<p>That here and there his fury had committed.</p>

<p>Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,</p>

<p>He broke from those that had the guard of him,</p>

<p>And with his mad attendant and himself,</p>

<p>Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,</p>

<p>Met us again and, madly bent on us,</p>

<p>Chased us away, till raising of more aid,</p>

<p>We came again to bind them. Then they fled</p>

<p>Into this abbey, whither we pursued them,</p>

<p>And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us</p>

<p>And will not suffer us to fetch him out,</p>

<p>Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.</p>

<p>Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command</p>

<p>Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Long since, thy husband served me in my wars,</p>

<p>And I to thee engaged a prince’s word,</p>

<p>When thou didst make him master of thy bed,</p>

<p>To do him all the grace and good I could.</p>

<p>Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,</p>

<p>And bid the Lady Abbess come to me.</p>

<p>I will determine this before I stir.     <i><i>[Adriana rises.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself.</p>

<p>My master and his man are both broke loose,</p>

<p>Beaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor,</p>

<p>Whose beard they have singed off with brands of</p>

<p>fire,</p>

<p>And ever as it blazed they threw on him</p>

<p>Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.</p>

<p>My master preaches patience to him, and the while</p>

<p>His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;</p>

<p>And sure, unless you send some present help,</p>

<p>Between them they will kill the conjurer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Peace, fool. Thy master and his man are here,</p>

<p>And that is false thou dost report to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Mistress, upon my life I tell you true.</p>

<p>I have not breathed almost since I did see it.</p>

<p>He cries for you and vows, if he can take you,</p>

<p>To scorch your face and to disfigure you.     <i><i>[Cry within.]</i></i></p>

<p>Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress. Fly, begone!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Come, stand by me. Fear nothing.–Guard with</p>

<p>halberds.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Ay me, it is my husband. Witness you</p>

<p>That he is borne about invisible.</p>

<p>Even now we housed him in the abbey here,</p>

<p>And now he’s there, past thought of human reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Justice, most gracious duke. O, grant me justice,</p>

<p>Even for the service that long since I did thee</p>

<p>When I bestrid thee in the wars and took</p>

<p>Deep scars to save thy life. Even for the blood</p>

<p>That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeon</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,</p>

<p>I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there,</p>

<p>She whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife,</p>

<p>That hath abused and dishonored me</p>

<p>Even in the strength and height of injury.</p>

<p>Beyond imagination is the wrong</p>

<p>That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me</p>

<p>While she with harlots feasted in my house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>A grievous fault.–Say, woman, didst thou so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister</p>

<p>Today did dine together. So befall my soul</p>

<p>As this is false he burdens me withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Ne’er may I look on day nor sleep on night</p>

<p>But she tells to your Highness simple truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>O perjured woman!–They are both forsworn.</p>

<p>In this the madman justly chargeth them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>My liege, I am advised what I say,</p>

<p>Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,</p>

<p>Nor heady-rash provoked with raging ire,</p>

<p>Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.</p>

<p>This woman locked me out this day from dinner.</p>

<p>That goldsmith there, were he not packed with her,</p>

<p>Could witness it, for he was with me then,</p>

<p>Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,</p>

<p>Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,</p>

<p>Where Balthasar and I did dine together.</p>

<p>Our dinner done and he not coming thither,</p>

<p>I went to seek him. In the street I met him,</p>

<p>And in his company that gentleman.</p>

<p><center><i>[He points to Second Merchant.]</i></center></p>

<p>There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down</p>

<p>That I this day of him received the chain,</p>

<p>Which, God He knows, I saw not; for the which</p>

<p>He did arrest me with an officer.</p>

<p>I did obey and sent my peasant home</p>

<p>For certain ducats. He with none returned.</p>

<p>Then fairly I bespoke the officer</p>

<p>To go in person with me to my house.</p>

<p>By th’ way we met</p>

<p>My wife, her sister, and a rabble more</p>

<p>Of vile confederates. Along with them</p>

<p>They brought one Pinch, a hungry, lean-faced</p>

<p>villain,</p>

<p>A mere anatomy, a mountebank,</p>

<p>A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,</p>

<p>A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,</p>

<p>A living dead man. This pernicious slave,</p>

<p>Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,</p>

<p>And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,</p>

<p>And with no face (as ’twere) outfacing me,</p>

<p>Cries out I was possessed. Then all together</p>

<p>They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,</p>

<p>And in a dark and dankish vault at home</p>

<p>There left me and my man, both bound together,</p>

<p>Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,</p>

<p>I gained my freedom and immediately</p>

<p>Ran hither to your Grace, whom I beseech</p>

<p>To give me ample satisfaction</p>

<p>For these deep shames and great indignities.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him:</p>

<p>That he dined not at home, but was locked out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>But had he such a chain of thee or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,</p>

<p>These people saw the chain about his neck.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Merchant</sc> <i>[to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine</p>

<p>Heard you confess you had the chain of him</p>

<p>After you first forswore it on the mart,</p>

<p>And thereupon I drew my sword on you,</p>

<p>And then you fled into this abbey here,</p>

<p>From whence I think you are come by miracle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>I never came within these abbey walls,</p>

<p>Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me.</p>

<p>I never saw the chain, so help me heaven,</p>

<p>And this is false you burden me withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Why, what an intricate impeach is this!</p>

<p>I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup.</p>

<p>If here you housed him, here he would have been.</p>

<p>If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.</p>

<p><i>[To Adriana.]</i> You say he dined at home; the</p>

<p>goldsmith here</p>

<p>Denies that saying. <i>[To Dromio of Ephesus.]</i> Sirrah,</p>

<p>what say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc> <i>[pointing to the Courtesan]</i></p>

<p>Sir, he dined with her there at the Porpentine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Courtesan</sc></p>

<p>He did, and from my finger snatched that ring.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc> <i>[showing a ring]</i></p>

<p>’Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[to Courtesan]</i></p>

<p>Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Courtesan</sc></p>

<p>As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Why, this is strange.–Go call the Abbess hither.</p>

<p><center><i>[Exit one to the Abbess.]</i></center></p>

<p>I think you are all mated or stark mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeon</sc></p>

<p>Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word.</p>

<p>Haply I see a friend will save my life</p>

<p>And pay the sum that may deliver me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeon</sc> <i>[to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>Is not your name, sir, called Antipholus?</p>

<p>And is not that your bondman Dromio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,</p>

<p>But he, I thank him, gnawed in two my cords.</p>

<p>Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeon</sc></p>

<p>I am sure you both of you remember me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you,</p>

<p>For lately we were bound as you are now.</p>

<p>You are not Pinch’s patient, are you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeon</sc> <i>[to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>Why look you strange on me? You know me well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>I never saw you in my life till now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeon</sc></p>

<p>O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,</p>

<p>And careful hours with time’s deformed hand</p>

<p>Have written strange defeatures in my face.</p>

<p>But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Neither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeon</sc>  Dromio, nor thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  No, trust me, sir, nor I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeon</sc>  I am sure thou dost.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not, and</p>

<p>whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to</p>

<p>believe him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeon</sc></p>

<p>Not know my voice! O time’s extremity,</p>

<p>Hast thou so cracked and splitted my poor tongue</p>

<p>In seven short years that here my only son</p>

<p>Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?</p>

<p>Though now this grained face of mine be hid</p>

<p>In sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow,</p>

<p>And all the conduits of my blood froze up,</p>

<p>Yet hath my night of life some memory,</p>

<p>My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,</p>

<p>My dull deaf ears a little use to hear.</p>

<p>All these old witnesses–I cannot err–</p>

<p>Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>I never saw my father in my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeon</sc></p>

<p>But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,</p>

<p>Thou know’st we parted. But perhaps, my son,</p>

<p>Thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>The Duke and all that know me in the city</p>

<p>Can witness with me that it is not so.</p>

<p>I ne’er saw Syracusa in my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years</p>

<p>Have I been patron to Antipholus,</p>

<p>During which time he ne’er saw Syracusa.</p>

<p>I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Emilia the Abbess, with Antipholus of</p>

<p>Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>Most mighty duke, behold a man much wronged.</p>

<p><center><i>[All gather to see them.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>One of these men is genius to the other.</p>

<p>And so, of these, which is the natural man</p>

<p>And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>I, sir, am Dromio. Command him away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>I, sir, am Dromio. Pray, let me stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>Egeon art thou not, or else his ghost?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>O, my old master.–Who hath bound him here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds</p>

<p>And gain a husband by his liberty.–</p>

<p>Speak, old Egeon, if thou be’st the man</p>

<p>That hadst a wife once called Emilia,</p>

<p>That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.</p>

<p>O, if thou be’st the same Egeon, speak,</p>

<p>And speak unto the same Emilia.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Why, here begins his morning story right:</p>

<p>These two Antipholus’, these two so like,</p>

<p>And these two Dromios, one in semblance–</p>

<p>Besides her urging of her wrack at sea–</p>

<p>These are the parents to these children,</p>

<p>Which accidentally are met together.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeon</sc></p>

<p>If I dream not, thou art Emilia.</p>

<p>If thou art she, tell me, where is that son</p>

<p>That floated with thee on the fatal raft?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>By men of Epidamium he and I</p>

<p>And the twin Dromio all were taken up;</p>

<p>But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth</p>

<p>By force took Dromio and my son from them,</p>

<p>And me they left with those of Epidamium.</p>

<p>What then became of them I cannot tell;</p>

<p>I to this fortune that you see me in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[to Antipholus of Syracuse]</i></p>

<p>Antipholus, thou cam’st from Corinth first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>No, sir, not I. I came from Syracuse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Stay, stand apart. I know not which is which.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  And I with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Brought to this town by that most famous warrior</p>

<p>Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Which of you two did dine with me today?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>I, gentle mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc>  And are not you my husband?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  No, I say nay to that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>And so do I, yet did she call me so,</p>

<p>And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,</p>

<p>Did call me brother. <i>[To Luciana.]</i> What I told you</p>

<p>then</p>

<p>I hope I shall have leisure to make good,</p>

<p>If this be not a dream I see and hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc> <i>[turning to Antipholus of Syracuse]</i></p>

<p>That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>I think it be, sir. I deny it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc> <i>[to Angelo]</i></p>

<p>And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>I think I did, sir. I deny it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc> <i>[to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>I sent you money, sir, to be your bail</p>

<p>By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  No, none by me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[to Adriana]</i></p>

<p>This purse of ducats I received from you,</p>

<p>And Dromio my man did bring them me.</p>

<p>I see we still did meet each other’s man,</p>

<p>And I was ta’en for him, and he for me,</p>

<p>And thereupon these errors are arose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc> <i>[to the Duke]</i></p>

<p>These ducats pawn I for my father here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>It shall not need. Thy father hath his life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Courtesan</sc> <i>[to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>Sir, I must have that diamond from you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>There, take it, and much thanks for my good cheer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abbess</sc></p>

<p>Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains</p>

<p>To go with us into the abbey here</p>

<p>And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes,</p>

<p>And all that are assembled in this place</p>

<p>That by this sympathized one day’s error</p>

<p>Have suffered wrong. Go, keep us company,</p>

<p>And we shall make full satisfaction.–</p>

<p>Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail</p>

<p>Of you, my sons, and till this present hour</p>

<p>My heavy burden ne’er delivered.–</p>

<p>The Duke, my husband, and my children both,</p>

<p>And you, the calendars of their nativity,</p>

<p>Go to a gossips’ feast, and go with me.</p>

<p>After so long grief, such nativity!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>With all my heart I’ll gossip at this feast.</p>

<p><center><i>[All exit except the two Dromios</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embarked?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>He speaks to me.–I am your master, Dromio.</p>

<p>Come, go with us. We’ll look to that anon.</p>

<p>Embrace thy brother there. Rejoice with him.</p>

<p><center><i>[The brothers Antipholus exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>There is a fat friend at your master’s house</p>

<p>That kitchened me for you today at dinner.</p>

<p>She now shall be my sister, not my wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother.</p>

<p>I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.</p>

<p>Will you walk in to see their gossiping?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc>  Not I, sir. You are my elder.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  That’s a question. How shall we</p>

<p>try it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc>  We’ll draw cuts for the signior.</p>

<p>Till then, lead thou first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Nay, then, thus:</p>

<p>We came into the world like brother and brother,</p>

<p>And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before</p>

<p>another.</p>
