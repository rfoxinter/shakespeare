<p><center><i>[Enter Solinus the Duke of Ephesus, with Egeon the</p>

<p>Merchant of Syracuse, Jailer, and other Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Egeon</span></p>

<p>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,</p>

<p>And by the doom of death end woes and all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more.</p>

<p>I am not partial to infringe our laws.</p>

<p>The enmity and discord which of late</p>

<p>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke</p>

<p>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</p>

<p>Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,</p>

<p>Have sealed his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</p>

<p>Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks.</p>

<p>For since the mortal and intestine jars</p>

<p>’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</p>

<p>It hath in solemn synods been decreed,</p>

<p>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</p>

<p>To admit no traffic to our adverse towns.</p>

<p>Nay, more, if any born at Ephesus</p>

<p>Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs;</p>

<p>Again, if any Syracusian born</p>

<p>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</p>

<p>His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose,</p>

<p>Unless a thousand marks be levied</p>

<p>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</p>

<p>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</p>

<p>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;</p>

<p>Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Egeon</span></p>

<p>Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,</p>

<p>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause</p>

<p>Why thou departedst from thy native home</p>

<p>And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Egeon</span></p>

<p>A heavier task could not have been imposed</p>

<p>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;</p>

<p>Yet, that the world may witness that my end</p>

<p>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,</p>

<p>I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.</p>

<p>In Syracusa was I born, and wed</p>

<p>Unto a woman happy but for me,</p>

<p>And by me, had not our hap been bad.</p>

<p>With her I lived in joy. Our wealth increased</p>

<p>By prosperous voyages I often made</p>

<p>To Epidamium, till my factor’s death</p>

<p>And the great care of goods at random left</p>

<p>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;</p>

<p>From whom my absence was not six months old</p>

<p>Before herself–almost at fainting under</p>

<p>The pleasing punishment that women bear–</p>

<p>Had made provision for her following me</p>

<p>And soon and safe arrived where I was.</p>

<p>There had she not been long but she became</p>

<p>A joyful mother of two goodly sons,</p>

<p>And, which was strange, the one so like the other</p>

<p>As could not be distinguished but by names.</p>

<p>That very hour, and in the selfsame inn,</p>

<p>A mean woman was delivered</p>

<p>Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.</p>

<p>Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,</p>

<p>I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</p>

<p>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</p>

<p>Made daily motions for our home return.</p>

<p>Unwilling, I agreed. Alas, too soon</p>

<p>We came aboard.</p>

<p>A league from Epidamium had we sailed</p>

<p>Before the always-wind-obeying deep</p>

<p>Gave any tragic instance of our harm;</p>

<p>But longer did we not retain much hope,</p>

<p>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</p>

<p>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</p>

<p>A doubtful warrant of immediate death,</p>

<p>Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</p>

<p>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</p>

<p>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</p>

<p>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</p>

<p>That mourned for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</p>

<p>Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</p>

<p>And this it was, for other means was none:</p>

<p>The sailors sought for safety by our boat</p>

<p>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.</p>

<p>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</p>

<p>Had fastened him unto a small spare mast,</p>

<p>Such as seafaring men provide for storms.</p>

<p>To him one of the other twins was bound,</p>

<p>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.</p>

<p>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</p>

<p>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed,</p>

<p>Fastened ourselves at either end the mast</p>

<p>And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,</p>

<p>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</p>

<p>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</p>

<p>Dispersed those vapors that offended us,</p>

<p>And by the benefit of his wished light</p>

<p>The seas waxed calm, and we discovered</p>

<p>Two ships from far, making amain to us,</p>

<p>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.</p>

<p>But ere they came–O, let me say no more!</p>

<p>Gather the sequel by that went before.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Nay, forward, old man. Do not break off so,</p>

<p>For we may pity though not pardon thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Egeon</span></p>

<p>O, had the gods done so, I had not now</p>

<p>Worthily termed them merciless to us.</p>

<p>For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</p>

<p>We were encountered by a mighty rock,</p>

<p>Which being violently borne upon,</p>

<p>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</p>

<p>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</p>

<p>Fortune had left to both of us alike</p>

<p>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</p>

<p>Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened</p>

<p>With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,</p>

<p>Was carried with more speed before the wind,</p>

<p>And in our sight they three were taken up</p>

<p>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</p>

<p>At length, another ship had seized on us</p>

<p>And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</p>

<p>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwracked guests,</p>

<p>And would have reft the fishers of their prey</p>

<p>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</p>

<p>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</p>

<p>Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss,</p>

<p>That by misfortunes was my life prolonged</p>

<p>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</p>

<p>Do me the favor to dilate at full</p>

<p>What have befall’n of them and thee till now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Egeon</span></p>

<p>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</p>

<p>At eighteen years became inquisitive</p>

<p>After his brother, and importuned me</p>

<p>That his attendant–so his case was like,</p>

<p>Reft of his brother, but retained his name–</p>

<p>Might bear him company in the quest of him,</p>

<p>Whom whilst I labored of a love to see,</p>

<p>I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.</p>

<p>Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,</p>

<p>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</p>

<p>And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,</p>

<p>Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</p>

<p>Or that or any place that harbors men.</p>

<p>But here must end the story of my life;</p>

<p>And happy were I in my timely death</p>

<p>Could all my travels warrant me they live.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have marked</p>

<p>To bear the extremity of dire mishap,</p>

<p>Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,</p>

<p>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</p>

<p>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</p>

<p>My soul should sue as advocate for thee.</p>

<p>But though thou art adjudged to the death,</p>

<p>And passed sentence may not be recalled</p>

<p>But to our honor’s great disparagement,</p>

<p>Yet will I favor thee in what I can.</p>

<p>Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day</p>

<p>To seek thy life by beneficial help.</p>

<p>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</p>

<p>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</p>

<p>And live. If no, then thou art doomed to die.–</p>

<p>Jailer, take him to thy custody.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jailer</span>  I will, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Egeon</span></p>

<p>Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend,</p>

<p>But to procrastinate his lifeless end.</p>
