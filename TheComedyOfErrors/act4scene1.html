<p><center><i>[Enter a Second Merchant, Angelo the Goldsmith,</p>

<p>and an Officer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Merchant</span> <i>[to Angelo]</i></p>

<p>You know since Pentecost the sum is due,</p>

<p>And since I have not much importuned you,</p>

<p>Nor now I had not, but that I am bound</p>

<p>To Persia and want guilders for my voyage.</p>

<p>Therefore make present satisfaction,</p>

<p>Or I’ll attach you by this officer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Even just the sum that I do owe to you</p>

<p>Is growing to me by Antipholus.</p>

<p>And in the instant that I met with you,</p>

<p>He had of me a chain. At five o’clock</p>

<p>I shall receive the money for the same.</p>

<p>Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,</p>

<p>I will discharge my bond and thank you too.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antipholus of Ephesus and Dromio of</p>

<p>Ephesus from the Courtesan’s.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Officer</span></p>

<p>That labor may you save. See where he comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span> <i>[to Dromio of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>While I go to the goldsmith’s house, go thou</p>

<p>And buy a rope’s end. That will I bestow</p>

<p>Among my wife and her confederates</p>

<p>For locking me out of my doors by day.</p>

<p>But soft. I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone.</p>

<p>Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>I buy a thousand pound a year! I buy a rope!</p>

<p><center><i>[Dromio exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span> <i>[to Angelo]</i></p>

<p>A man is well holp up that trusts to you!</p>

<p>I promised your presence and the chain,</p>

<p>But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.</p>

<p>Belike you thought our love would last too long</p>

<p>If it were chained together, and therefore came not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span> <i>[handing a paper to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>Saving your merry humor, here’s the note</p>

<p>How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,</p>

<p>The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,</p>

<p>Which doth amount to three-odd ducats more</p>

<p>Than I stand debted to this gentleman.</p>

<p>I pray you, see him presently discharged,</p>

<p>For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>I am not furnished with the present money.</p>

<p>Besides, I have some business in the town.</p>

<p>Good signior, take the stranger to my house,</p>

<p>And with you take the chain, and bid my wife</p>

<p>Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.</p>

<p>Perchance I will be there as soon as you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Then you will bring the chain to her yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>No, bear it with you lest I come not time enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>An if I have not, sir, I hope you have,</p>

<p>Or else you may return without your money.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain.</p>

<p>Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,</p>

<p>And I, to blame, have held him here too long.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>Good Lord! You use this dalliance to excuse</p>

<p>Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.</p>

<p>I should have chid you for not bringing it,</p>

<p>But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Merchant</span> <i>[to Angelo]</i></p>

<p>The hour steals on. I pray you, sir, dispatch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span> <i>[to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>You hear how he importunes me. The chain!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Come, come. You know I gave it you even now.</p>

<p>Either send the chain, or send by me some token.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>Fie, now you run this humor out of breath.</p>

<p>Come, where’s the chain? I pray you, let me see it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>My business cannot brook this dalliance.</p>

<p>Good sir, say whe’er you’ll answer me or no.</p>

<p>If not, I’ll leave him to the Officer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>I answer you? What should I answer you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>The money that you owe me for the chain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>I owe you none till I receive the chain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>You know I gave it you half an hour since.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>You gave me none. You wrong me much to say so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.</p>

<p>Consider how it stands upon my credit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Merchant</span></p>

<p>Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Officer</span> <i>[to Angelo]</i></p>

<p>I do, and charge you in the Duke’s name to obey</p>

<p>me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span> <i>[to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>This touches me in reputation.</p>

<p>Either consent to pay this sum for me,</p>

<p>Or I attach you by this officer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>Consent to pay thee that I never had?–</p>

<p>Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span> <i>[to Officer]</i></p>

<p>Here is thy fee. Arrest him, officer.     <i><i>[Giving money.]</i></i></p>

<p>I would not spare my brother in this case</p>

<p>If he should scorn me so apparently.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Officer</span> <i>[to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>I do arrest you, sir. You hear the suit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>I do obey thee till I give thee bail.</p>

<p><i>[To Angelo.]</i> But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as</p>

<p>dear</p>

<p>As all the metal in your shop will answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,</p>

<p>To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dromio of Syracuse from the bay.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Master, there’s a bark of Epidamium</p>

<p>That stays but till her owner comes aboard,</p>

<p>And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,</p>

<p>I have conveyed aboard, and I have bought</p>

<p>The oil, the balsamum, and aqua vitae.</p>

<p>The ship is in her trim; the merry wind</p>

<p>Blows fair from land. They stay for naught at all</p>

<p>But for their owner, master, and yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>How now? A madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,</p>

<p>What ship of Epidamium stays for me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope</p>

<p>And told thee to what purpose and what end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>You sent me for a rope’s end as soon.</p>

<p>You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span></p>

<p>I will debate this matter at more leisure</p>

<p>And teach your ears to list me with more heed.</p>

<p>To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives a key.]</i></center></p>

<p>Give her this key, and tell her in the desk</p>

<p>That’s covered o’er with Turkish tapestry</p>

<p>There is a purse of ducats. Let her send it.</p>

<p>Tell her I am arrested in the street,</p>

<p>And that shall bail me. Hie thee, slave. Begone.–</p>

<p>On, officer, to prison till it come.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Dromio of Syracuse exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>To Adriana. That is where we dined,</p>

<p>Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.</p>

<p>She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.</p>

<p>Thither I must, although against my will,</p>

<p>For servants must their masters’ minds fulfill.</p>
