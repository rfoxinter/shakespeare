<p><center><i>[Enter Antipholus of Ephesus with a Jailer, the Officer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Fear me not, man. I will not break away.</p>

<p>I’ll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,</p>

<p>To warrant thee, as I am ’rested for.</p>

<p>My wife is in a wayward mood today</p>

<p>And will not lightly trust the messenger</p>

<p>That I should be attached in Ephesus.</p>

<p>I tell you, ’twill sound harshly in her ears.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dromio of Ephesus with a rope’s end.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes my man. I think he brings the</p>

<p>money.</p>

<p>How now, sir? Have you that I sent you for?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc> <i>[handing over the rope’s end]</i></p>

<p>Here’s that, I warrant you, will pay them all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  But where’s the money?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>I’ll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  To a rope’s end, sir, and to that</p>

<p>end am I returned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc> <i>[beating Dromio]</i></p>

<p>And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Officer</sc>  Good sir, be patient.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Nay, ’tis for me to be patient. I am</p>

<p>in adversity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Officer</sc>  Good now, hold thy tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Nay, rather persuade him to hold</p>

<p>his hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Thou whoreson, senseless</p>

<p>villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  I would I were senseless, sir, that</p>

<p>I might not feel your blows.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Thou art sensible in nothing</p>

<p>but blows, and so is an ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  I am an ass, indeed; you may</p>

<p>prove it by my long ears.–I have served him from</p>

<p>the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have</p>

<p>nothing at his hands for my service but blows.</p>

<p>When I am cold, he heats me with beating; when I</p>

<p>am warm, he cools me with beating. I am waked</p>

<p>with it when I sleep, raised with it when I sit,</p>

<p>driven out of doors with it when I go from home,</p>

<p>welcomed home with it when I return. Nay, I bear it</p>

<p>on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat, and I</p>

<p>think when he hath lamed me, I shall beg with it</p>

<p>from door to door.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan, and a Schoolmaster</p>

<p>called Pinch.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Come, go along. My wife is coming yonder.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Mistress, respice finem, respect</p>

<p>your end, or rather, the prophecy like the parrot,</p>

<p>“Beware the rope’s end.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Wilt thou still talk?</p>

<p><center><i>[Beats Dromio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Courtesan</sc> <i>[to Adriana]</i></p>

<p>How say you now? Is not your husband mad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>His incivility confirms no less.–</p>

<p>Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;</p>

<p>Establish him in his true sense again,</p>

<p>And I will please you what you will demand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Courtesan</sc></p>

<p>Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pinch</sc> <i>[to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc> <i>[striking Pinch]</i></p>

<p>There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pinch</sc></p>

<p>I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,</p>

<p>To yield possession to my holy prayers,</p>

<p>And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.</p>

<p>I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Peace, doting wizard, peace. I am not mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>You minion, you, are these your customers?</p>

<p>Did this companion with the saffron face</p>

<p>Revel and feast it at my house today</p>

<p>Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut</p>

<p>And I denied to enter in my house?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>O husband, God doth know you dined at home,</p>

<p>Where would you had remained until this time,</p>

<p>Free from these slanders and this open shame.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>“Dined at home”? <i>[To Dromio.]</i> Thou villain, what</p>

<p>sayest thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Were not my doors locked up and I shut out?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Perdie, your doors were locked, and you shut out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>And did not she herself revile me there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Did not her kitchen maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Certes, she did; the kitchen vestal scorned you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>And did not I in rage depart from thence?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>In verity you did.–My bones bears witness,</p>

<p>That since have felt the vigor of his rage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc> <i>[to Pinch]</i></p>

<p>Is ’t good to soothe him in these contraries?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pinch</sc></p>

<p>It is no shame. The fellow finds his vein</p>

<p>And, yielding to him, humors well his frenzy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc> <i>[to Adriana]</i></p>

<p>Thou hast suborned the goldsmith to arrest me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Alas, I sent you money to redeem you</p>

<p>By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Money by me? Heart and goodwill you might,</p>

<p>But surely, master, not a rag of money.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Went’st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>He came to me, and I delivered it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>And I am witness with her that she did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>God and the rope-maker bear me witness</p>

<p>That I was sent for nothing but a rope.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pinch</sc></p>

<p>Mistress, both man and master is possessed.</p>

<p>I know it by their pale and deadly looks.</p>

<p>They must be bound and laid in some dark room.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc> <i>[to Adriana]</i></p>

<p>Say wherefore didst thou lock me forth today.</p>

<p><i>[To Dromio of Ephesus.]</i> And why dost thou deny the</p>

<p>bag of gold?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>And, gentle master, I received no gold.</p>

<p>But I confess, sir, that we were locked out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Dissembling villain, thou speak’st false in both.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,</p>

<p>And art confederate with a damned pack</p>

<p>To make a loathsome abject scorn of me.</p>

<p>But with these nails I’ll pluck out these false eyes</p>

<p>That would behold in me this shameful sport.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>O bind him, bind him! Let him not come near me.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pinch</sc></p>

<p>More company! The fiend is strong within him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>What, will you murder me?–Thou jailer, thou,</p>

<p>I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou suffer them</p>

<p>To make a rescue?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Officer</sc>  Masters, let him go.</p>

<p>He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pinch</sc></p>

<p>Go, bind this man, for he is frantic too.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dromio is bound.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc> <i>[to Officer]</i></p>

<p>What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?</p>

<p>Hast thou delight to see a wretched man</p>

<p>Do outrage and displeasure to himself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Officer</sc></p>

<p>He is my prisoner. If I let him go,</p>

<p>The debt he owes will be required of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>I will discharge thee ere I go from thee.</p>

<p>Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,</p>

<p>And knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.–</p>

<p>Good Master Doctor, see him safe conveyed</p>

<p>Home to my house. O most unhappy day!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  O most unhappy strumpet!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Master, I am here entered in bond for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Out on thee, villain! Wherefore dost thou mad me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Will you be bound for nothing? Be mad, good</p>

<p>master.</p>

<p>Cry “The devil!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>God help poor souls! How idly do they talk!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc> <i>[to Pinch]</i></p>

<p>Go bear him hence.</p>

<p><center><i>[Pinch and his men exit with Antipholus</p>

<p>and Dromio of Ephesus.</p>

<p>Officer, Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan remain.]</i></center></p>

<p>Sister, go you with me.</p>

<p><i>[To Officer.]</i> Say now whose suit is he arrested at.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Officer</sc></p>

<p>One Angelo, a goldsmith. Do you know him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>I know the man. What is the sum he owes?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Officer</sc></p>

<p>Two hundred ducats.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc>  Say, how grows it due?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Officer</sc></p>

<p>Due for a chain your husband had of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Courtesan</sc></p>

<p>Whenas your husband all in rage today</p>

<p>Came to my house and took away my ring,</p>

<p>The ring I saw upon his finger now,</p>

<p>Straight after did I meet him with a chain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>It may be so, but I did never see it.–</p>

<p>Come, jailer, bring me where the goldsmith is.</p>

<p>I long to know the truth hereof at large.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antipholus of Syracuse with his rapier drawn,</p>

<p>and Dromio of Syracuse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>God for Thy mercy, they are loose again!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>And come with naked swords. Let’s call more help</p>

<p>To have them bound again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Officer</sc>  Away! They’ll kill us.</p>

<p><center><i>[Run all out as fast as may be, frighted.</p>

<p>Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse remain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>I see these witches are afraid of swords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>She that would be your wife now ran from you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>Come to the Centaur. Fetch our stuff from thence.</p>

<p>I long that we were safe and sound aboard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc>  Faith, stay here this night. They</p>

<p>will surely do us no harm. You saw they speak us</p>

<p>fair, give us gold. Methinks they are such a gentle</p>

<p>nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh that</p>

<p>claims marriage of me, I could find in my heart to</p>

<p>stay here still, and turn witch.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc></p>

<p>I will not stay tonight for all the town.</p>

<p>Therefore, away, to get our stuff aboard.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
