<p><center><i>[Enter Luciana with Antipholus of Syracuse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Luciana</span></p>

<p>And may it be that you have quite forgot</p>

<p>   <i>A husband’s office? Shall, Antipholus,</i></p>

<p>Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot?</p>

<p>   <i>Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?</i></p>

<p>If you did wed my sister for her wealth,</p>

<p>   <i>Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more</i></p>

<p>   <i>kindness.</i></p>

<p>Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth –</p>

<p>   <i>Muffle your false love with some show of</i></p>

<p>   <i>blindness.</i></p>

<p>Let not my sister read it in your eye;</p>

<p>   <i>Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator;</i></p>

<p>Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;</p>

<p>   <i>Apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger.</i></p>

<p>Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted.</p>

<p>   <i>Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint.</i></p>

<p>Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?</p>

<p>   <i>What simple thief brags of his own attaint?</i></p>

<p>’Tis double wrong to truant with your bed</p>

<p>   <i>And let her read it in thy looks at board.</i></p>

<p>Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;</p>

<p>   <i>Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.</i></p>

<p>Alas, poor women, make us but believe,</p>

<p>   <i>Being compact of credit, that you love us.</i></p>

<p>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;</p>

<p>   <i>We in your motion turn, and you may move us.</i></p>

<p>Then, gentle brother, get you in again.</p>

<p>   <i>Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.</i></p>

<p>’Tis holy sport to be a little vain</p>

<p>   <i>When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Sweet mistress–what your name is else I know not,</p>

<p>   <i>Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine–</i></p>

<p>Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not</p>

<p>   <i>Than our Earth’s wonder, more than Earth divine.</i></p>

<p>Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak.</p>

<p>   <i>Lay open to my earthy gross conceit,</i></p>

<p>Smothered in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,</p>

<p>   <i>The folded meaning of your words’ deceit.</i></p>

<p>Against my soul’s pure truth why labor you</p>

<p>   <i>To make it wander in an unknown field?</i></p>

<p>Are you a god? Would you create me new?</p>

<p>   <i>Transform me, then, and to your power I’ll yield.</i></p>

<p>But if that I am I, then well I know</p>

<p>   <i>Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,</i></p>

<p>Nor to her bed no homage do I owe.</p>

<p>   <i>Far more, far more, to you do I decline.</i></p>

<p>O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note</p>

<p>   <i>To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears.</i></p>

<p>Sing, Siren, for thyself, and I will dote.</p>

<p>   <i>Spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs,</i></p>

<p>And as a bed I’ll take them and there lie,</p>

<p>   <i>And in that glorious supposition think</i></p>

<p>He gains by death that hath such means to die.</p>

<p>   <i>Let love, being light, be drowned if she sink.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Luciana</span></p>

<p>What, are you mad that you do reason so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Not mad, but mated–how, I do not know.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Luciana</span></p>

<p>It is a fault that springeth from your eye.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Luciana</span></p>

<p>Gaze when you should, and that will clear your</p>

<p>sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Luciana</span></p>

<p>Why call you me “love”? Call my sister so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Thy sister’s sister.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Luciana</span>  That’s my sister.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  No,</p>

<p>It is thyself, mine own self’s better part,</p>

<p>Mine eye’s clear eye, my dear heart’s dearer heart,</p>

<p>My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope’s aim,</p>

<p>My sole Earth’s heaven, and my heaven’s claim.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Luciana</span></p>

<p>All this my sister is, or else should be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Call thyself “sister,” sweet, for I am thee.</p>

<p>Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;</p>

<p>Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.</p>

<p>Give me thy hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Luciana</span>  O soft, sir. Hold you still.</p>

<p>I’ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dromio of Syracuse, running.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Why, how now, Dromio.</p>

<p>Where runn’st thou so fast?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Do you know me, sir? Am I</p>

<p>Dromio? Am I your man? Am I myself?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Thou art Dromio, thou art</p>

<p>my man, thou art thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  I am an ass, I am a woman’s</p>

<p>man, and besides myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  What woman’s man? And</p>

<p>how besides thyself?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Marry, sir, besides myself I am</p>

<p>due to a woman, one that claims me, one that</p>

<p>haunts me, one that will have me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  What claim lays she to thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Marry, sir, such claim as you</p>

<p>would lay to your horse, and she would have me as</p>

<p>a beast; not that I being a beast she would have me,</p>

<p>but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays</p>

<p>claim to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  What is she?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  A very reverend body, ay, such a</p>

<p>one as a man may not speak of without he say</p>

<p>“sir-reverence.” I have but lean luck in the match,</p>

<p>and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  How dost thou mean a “fat</p>

<p>marriage”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen</p>

<p>wench, and all grease, and I know not what use to</p>

<p>put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from</p>

<p>her by her own light. I warrant her rags and the</p>

<p>tallow in them will burn a Poland winter. If she lives</p>

<p>till doomsday, she’ll burn a week longer than the</p>

<p>whole world.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  What complexion is she of?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Swart like my shoe, but her face</p>

<p>nothing like so clean kept. For why? She sweats. A</p>

<p>man may go overshoes in the grime of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  That’s a fault that water will</p>

<p>mend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  No, sir, ’tis in grain; Noah’s flood</p>

<p>could not do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  What’s her name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Nell, sir, but her name and</p>

<p>three quarters–that’s an ell and three quarters–</p>

<p>will not measure her from hip to hip.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Then she bears some</p>

<p>breadth?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  No longer from head to foot than</p>

<p>from hip to hip. She is spherical, like a globe. I</p>

<p>could find out countries in her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  In what part of her body</p>

<p>stands Ireland?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Marry, sir, in her buttocks. I</p>

<p>found it out by the bogs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Where Scotland?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  I found it by the barrenness,</p>

<p>hard in the palm of the hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Where France?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  In her forehead, armed and</p>

<p>reverted, making war against her heir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Where England?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  I looked for the chalky cliffs, but</p>

<p>I could find no whiteness in them. But I guess it</p>

<p>stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran</p>

<p>between France and it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Where Spain?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot</p>

<p>in her breath.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Where America, the Indies?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  O, sir, upon her nose, all o’erembellished</p>

<p>with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires,</p>

<p>declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of</p>

<p>Spain, who sent whole armadas of carracks to be</p>

<p>ballast at her nose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Where stood Belgia, the</p>

<p>Netherlands?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  O, sir, I did not look so low. To</p>

<p>conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me,</p>

<p>called me Dromio, swore I was assured to her, told</p>

<p>me what privy marks I had about me, as the mark</p>

<p>of my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart</p>

<p>on my left arm, that I, amazed, ran from her as a</p>

<p>witch.</p>

<p>And, I think, if my breast had not been made of</p>

<p>faith, and my heart of steel,</p>

<p>She had transformed me to a curtal dog and made</p>

<p>me turn i’ th’ wheel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Go, hie thee presently. Post to the road.</p>

<p>An if the wind blow any way from shore,</p>

<p>I will not harbor in this town tonight.</p>

<p>If any bark put forth, come to the mart,</p>

<p>Where I will walk till thou return to me.</p>

<p>If everyone knows us, and we know none,</p>

<p>’Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>As from a bear a man would run for life,</p>

<p>So fly I from her that would be my wife.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>There’s none but witches do inhabit here,</p>

<p>And therefore ’tis high time that I were hence.</p>

<p>She that doth call me husband, even my soul</p>

<p>Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,</p>

<p>Possessed with such a gentle sovereign grace,</p>

<p>Of such enchanting presence and discourse,</p>

<p>Hath almost made me traitor to myself.</p>

<p>But lest myself be guilty to self wrong,</p>

<p>I’ll stop mine ears against the mermaid’s song.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Angelo with the chain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Master Antipholus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Ay, that’s my name.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>I know it well, sir. Lo, here’s the chain.</p>

<p>I thought to have ta’en you at the Porpentine;</p>

<p>The chain unfinished made me stay thus long.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives Antipholus a chain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>What is your will that I shall do with this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>What please yourself, sir. I have made it for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Made it for me, sir? I bespoke it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.</p>

<p>Go home with it, and please your wife withal,</p>

<p>And soon at supper time I’ll visit you</p>

<p>And then receive my money for the chain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>I pray you, sir, receive the money now,</p>

<p>For fear you ne’er see chain nor money more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>You are a merry man, sir. Fare you well.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>What I should think of this I cannot tell,</p>

<p>But this I think: there’s no man is so vain</p>

<p>That would refuse so fair an offered chain.</p>

<p>I see a man here needs not live by shifts</p>

<p>When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.</p>

<p>I’ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay.</p>

<p>If any ship put out, then straight away.</p>
