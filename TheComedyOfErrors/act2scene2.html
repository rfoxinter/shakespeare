<p><center><i>[Enter Antipholus of Syracuse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up</p>

<p>Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave</p>

<p>Is wandered forth in care to seek me out.</p>

<p>By computation and mine host’s report,</p>

<p>I could not speak with Dromio since at first</p>

<p>I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dromio of Syracuse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, sir? Is your merry humor altered?</p>

<p>As you love strokes, so jest with me again.</p>

<p>You know no Centaur? You received no gold?</p>

<p>Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?</p>

<p>My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,</p>

<p>That thus so madly thou didst answer me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Even now, even here, not half an hour since.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>I did not see you since you sent me hence,</p>

<p>Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Villain, thou didst deny the gold’s receipt</p>

<p>And told’st me of a mistress and a dinner,</p>

<p>For which I hope thou felt’st I was displeased.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>I am glad to see you in this merry vein.</p>

<p>What means this jest, I pray you, master, tell me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?</p>

<p>Think’st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that and that.</p>

<p><center><i>[Beats Dromio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Hold, sir, for God’s sake! Now your jest is earnest.</p>

<p>Upon what bargain do you give it me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Because that I familiarly sometimes</p>

<p>Do use you for my fool and chat with you,</p>

<p>Your sauciness will jest upon my love</p>

<p>And make a common of my serious hours.</p>

<p>When the sun shines, let foolish gnats make sport,</p>

<p>But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.</p>

<p>If you will jest with me, know my aspect,</p>

<p>And fashion your demeanor to my looks,</p>

<p>Or I will beat this method in your sconce.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  “Sconce” call you it? So you</p>

<p>would leave battering, I had rather have it a</p>

<p>“head.” An you use these blows long, I must get a</p>

<p>sconce for my head and ensconce it too, or else I</p>

<p>shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But I pray, sir,</p>

<p>why am I beaten?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Dost thou not know?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Nothing, sir, but that I am</p>

<p>beaten.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Shall I tell you why?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Ay, sir, and wherefore, for they</p>

<p>say every why hath a wherefore.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  “Why” first: for flouting</p>

<p>me; and then “wherefore”: for urging it the second</p>

<p>time to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,</p>

<p>When in the “why” and the “wherefore” is neither</p>

<p>rhyme nor reason?</p>

<p>Well, sir, I thank you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Thank me, sir, for what?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Marry, sir, for this something</p>

<p>that you gave me for nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  I’ll make you amends next,</p>

<p>to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it</p>

<p>dinnertime?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  No, sir, I think the meat wants</p>

<p>that I have.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  In good time, sir, what’s</p>

<p>that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Basting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of</p>

<p>it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Your reason?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Lest it make you choleric and</p>

<p>purchase me another dry basting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Well, sir, learn to jest in</p>

<p>good time. There’s a time for all things.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  I durst have denied that before</p>

<p>you were so choleric.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  By what rule, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as</p>

<p>the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Let’s hear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  There’s no time for a man to</p>

<p>recover his hair that grows bald by nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  May he not do it by fine and</p>

<p>recovery?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig,</p>

<p>and recover the lost hair of another man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Why is Time such a niggard</p>

<p>of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Because it is a blessing that he</p>

<p>bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men</p>

<p>in hair, he hath given them in wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Why, but there’s many a</p>

<p>man hath more hair than wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Not a man of those but he hath</p>

<p>the wit to lose his hair.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Why, thou didst conclude</p>

<p>hairy men plain dealers without wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  The plainer dealer, the sooner</p>

<p>lost. Yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  For what reason?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  For two, and sound ones too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Nay, not sound, I pray you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Sure ones, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Nay, not sure, in a thing</p>

<p>falsing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Certain ones, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Name them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  The one, to save the money that</p>

<p>he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they</p>

<p>should not drop in his porridge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  You would all this time</p>

<p>have proved there is no time for all things.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Marry, and did, sir: namely, e’en</p>

<p>no time to recover hair lost by nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  But your reason was not</p>

<p>substantial why there is no time to recover.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Thus I mend it: Time himself is</p>

<p>bald and therefore, to the world’s end, will have</p>

<p>bald followers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  I knew ’twould be a bald</p>

<p>conclusion. But soft, who wafts us yonder?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Adriana, beckoning them, and Luciana.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adriana</span></p>

<p>Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.</p>

<p>Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects.</p>

<p>I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.</p>

<p>The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow</p>

<p>That never words were music to thine ear,</p>

<p>That never object pleasing in thine eye,</p>

<p>That never touch well welcome to thy hand,</p>

<p>That never meat sweet-savored in thy taste,</p>

<p>Unless I spake, or looked, or touched, or carved to</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<p>How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it</p>

<p>That thou art then estranged from thyself?</p>

<p>“Thyself” I call it, being strange to me,</p>

<p>That, undividable, incorporate,</p>

<p>Am better than thy dear self’s better part.</p>

<p>Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!</p>

<p>For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall</p>

<p>A drop of water in the breaking gulf,</p>

<p>And take unmingled thence that drop again</p>

<p>Without addition or diminishing,</p>

<p>As take from me thyself and not me too.</p>

<p>How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,</p>

<p>Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious</p>

<p>And that this body, consecrate to thee,</p>

<p>By ruffian lust should be contaminate!</p>

<p>Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn at me,</p>

<p>And hurl the name of husband in my face,</p>

<p>And tear the stained skin off my harlot brow,</p>

<p>And from my false hand cut the wedding ring,</p>

<p>And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?</p>

<p>I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.</p>

<p>I am possessed with an adulterate blot;</p>

<p>My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;</p>

<p>For if we two be one, and thou play false,</p>

<p>I do digest the poison of thy flesh,</p>

<p>Being strumpeted by thy contagion.</p>

<p>Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed,</p>

<p>I live distained, thou undishonored.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not.</p>

<p>In Ephesus I am but two hours old,</p>

<p>As strange unto your town as to your talk,</p>

<p>Who, every word by all my wit being scanned,</p>

<p>Wants wit in all one word to understand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Luciana</span></p>

<p>Fie, brother, how the world is changed with you!</p>

<p>When were you wont to use my sister thus?</p>

<p>She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  By Dromio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  By me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adriana</span></p>

<p>By thee; and this thou didst return from him:</p>

<p>That he did buffet thee and, in his blows,</p>

<p>Denied my house for his, me for his wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?</p>

<p>What is the course and drift of your compact?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>I, sir? I never saw her till this time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Villain, thou liest, for even her very words</p>

<p>Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>I never spake with her in all my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>How can she thus then call us by our names–</p>

<p>Unless it be by inspiration?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adriana</span></p>

<p>How ill agrees it with your gravity</p>

<p>To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,</p>

<p>Abetting him to thwart me in my mood.</p>

<p>Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,</p>

<p>But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.</p>

<p>Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine.</p>

<p><center><i>[She takes his arm.]</i></center></p>

<p>Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,</p>

<p>Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,</p>

<p>Makes me with thy strength to communicate.</p>

<p>If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,</p>

<p>Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss,</p>

<p>Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion</p>

<p>Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.</p>

<p>What, was I married to her in my dream?</p>

<p>Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?</p>

<p>What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?</p>

<p>Until I know this sure uncertainty</p>

<p>I’ll entertain the offered fallacy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Luciana</span></p>

<p>Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.</p>

<p><center><i>[He crosses himself.]</i></center></p>

<p>This is the fairy land. O spite of spites!</p>

<p>We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.</p>

<p>If we obey them not, this will ensue:</p>

<p>They’ll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Luciana</span></p>

<p>Why prat’st thou to thyself and answer’st not?</p>

<p>Dromio–thou, Dromio–thou snail, thou slug,</p>

<p>thou sot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>I am transformed, master, am I not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>I think thou art in mind, and so am I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Thou hast thine own form.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  No, I am an ape.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Luciana</span></p>

<p>If thou art changed to aught, ’tis to an ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>’Tis true. She rides me, and I long for grass.</p>

<p>’Tis so. I am an ass; else it could never be</p>

<p>But I should know her as well as she knows me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adriana</span></p>

<p>Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,</p>

<p>To put the finger in the eye and weep</p>

<p>Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.</p>

<p>Come, sir, to dinner.–Dromio, keep the gate.–</p>

<p>Husband, I’ll dine above with you today,</p>

<p>And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.</p>

<p><i>[To Dromio.]</i> Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,</p>

<p>Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.–</p>

<p>Come, sister.–Dromio, play the porter well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Am I in Earth, in heaven, or in hell?</p>

<p>Sleeping or waking, mad or well-advised?</p>

<p>Known unto these, and to myself disguised!</p>

<p>And in this mist at all adventures go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Master, shall I be porter at the gate?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Adriana</span></p>

<p>Ay, and let none enter, lest I break your pate.</p>
