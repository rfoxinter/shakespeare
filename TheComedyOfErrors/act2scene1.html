<p><center><i>[Enter Adriana, wife to Antipholus of Ephesus, with</p>

<p>Luciana, her sister.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Neither my husband nor the slave returned</p>

<p>That in such haste I sent to seek his master?</p>

<p>Sure, Luciana, it is two o’clock.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,</p>

<p>And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner.</p>

<p>Good sister, let us dine, and never fret.</p>

<p>A man is master of his liberty;</p>

<p>Time is their master, and when they see time</p>

<p>They’ll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Why should their liberty than ours be more?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Because their business still lies out o’ door.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>O, know he is the bridle of your will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>There’s none but asses will be bridled so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Why, headstrong liberty is lashed with woe.</p>

<p>There’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye</p>

<p>But hath his bound in earth, in sea, in sky.</p>

<p>The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls</p>

<p>Are their males’ subjects and at their controls.</p>

<p>Man, more divine, the master of all these,</p>

<p>Lord of the wide world and wild wat’ry seas,</p>

<p>Endued with intellectual sense and souls,</p>

<p>Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,</p>

<p>Are masters to their females, and their lords.</p>

<p>Then let your will attend on their accords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>This servitude makes you to keep unwed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Not this, but troubles of the marriage bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Ere I learn love, I’ll practice to obey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>How if your husband start some otherwhere?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Till he come home again, I would forbear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Patience unmoved! No marvel though she pause;</p>

<p>They can be meek that have no other cause.</p>

<p>A wretched soul bruised with adversity</p>

<p>We bid be quiet when we hear it cry,</p>

<p>But were we burdened with like weight of pain,</p>

<p>As much or more we should ourselves complain.</p>

<p>So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,</p>

<p>With urging helpless patience would relieve me;</p>

<p>But if thou live to see like right bereft,</p>

<p>This fool-begged patience in thee will be left.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Well, I will marry one day, but to try.</p>

<p>Here comes your man. Now is your husband nigh.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dromio of Ephesus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Say, is your tardy master now at hand?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Nay, he’s at two hands with me,</p>

<p>and that my two ears can witness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Say, didst thou speak with him? Know’st thou his</p>

<p>mind?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.</p>

<p>Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc>  Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel</p>

<p>his meaning?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Nay, he struck so plainly I could</p>

<p>too well feel his blows, and withal so doubtfully</p>

<p>that I could scarce understand them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>But say, I prithee, is he coming home?</p>

<p>It seems he hath great care to please his wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Why, mistress, sure my master is horn mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Horn mad, thou villain?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  I mean not cuckold mad,</p>

<p>But sure he is stark mad.</p>

<p>When I desired him to come home to dinner,</p>

<p>He asked me for a thousand marks in gold.</p>

<p>“’Tis dinnertime,” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he.</p>

<p>“Your meat doth burn,” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth</p>

<p>he.</p>

<p>“Will you come?” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he.</p>

<p>“Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?”</p>

<p>“The pig,” quoth I, “is burned.” “My gold,” quoth</p>

<p>he.</p>

<p>“My mistress, sir,” quoth I. “Hang up thy mistress!</p>

<p>I know not thy mistress. Out on thy mistress!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc>  Quoth who?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Quoth my master.</p>

<p>“I know,” quoth he, “no house, no wife, no</p>

<p>mistress.”</p>

<p>So that my errand, due unto my tongue,</p>

<p>I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders,</p>

<p>For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Go back again and be new beaten home?</p>

<p>For God’s sake, send some other messenger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>And he will bless that cross with other beating.</p>

<p>Between you, I shall have a holy head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Hence, prating peasant. Fetch thy master home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Am I so round with you as you with me,</p>

<p>That like a football you do spurn me thus?</p>

<p>You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither.</p>

<p>If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Fie, how impatience loureth in your face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>His company must do his minions grace,</p>

<p>Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.</p>

<p>Hath homely age th’ alluring beauty took</p>

<p>From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.</p>

<p>Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?</p>

<p>If voluble and sharp discourse be marred,</p>

<p>Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.</p>

<p>Do their gay vestments his affections bait?</p>

<p>That’s not my fault; he’s master of my state.</p>

<p>What ruins are in me that can be found</p>

<p>By him not ruined? Then is he the ground</p>

<p>Of my defeatures. My decayed fair</p>

<p>A sunny look of his would soon repair.</p>

<p>But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale</p>

<p>And feeds from home. Poor I am but his stale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>Self-harming jealousy, fie, beat it hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.</p>

<p>I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,</p>

<p>Or else what lets it but he would be here?</p>

<p>Sister, you know he promised me a chain.</p>

<p>Would that alone o’ love he would detain,</p>

<p>So he would keep fair quarter with his bed.</p>

<p>I see the jewel best enameled</p>

<p>Will lose his beauty. Yet the gold bides still</p>

<p>That others touch, and often touching will</p>

<p>Wear gold; yet no man that hath a name</p>

<p>By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.</p>

<p>Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,</p>

<p>I’ll weep what’s left away, and weeping die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luciana</sc></p>

<p>How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!</p>
