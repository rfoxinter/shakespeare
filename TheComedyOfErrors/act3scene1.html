<p><center><i>[Enter Antipholus of Ephesus, his man Dromio, Angelo</p>

<p>the goldsmith, and Balthasar the merchant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;</p>

<p>My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.</p>

<p>Say that I lingered with you at your shop</p>

<p>To see the making of her carcanet,</p>

<p>And that tomorrow you will bring it home.</p>

<p>But here’s a villain that would face me down</p>

<p>He met me on the mart, and that I beat him</p>

<p>And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,</p>

<p>And that I did deny my wife and house.–</p>

<p>Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.</p>

<p>That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to</p>

<p>show;</p>

<p>If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave</p>

<p>were ink,</p>

<p>Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>I think thou art an ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  Marry, so it doth appear</p>

<p>By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.</p>

<p>I should kick being kicked and, being at that pass,</p>

<p>You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>You’re sad, Signior Balthasar. Pray God our cheer</p>

<p>May answer my goodwill and your good welcome</p>

<p>here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Balthasar</sc></p>

<p>I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome</p>

<p>dear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>O Signior Balthasar, either at flesh or fish</p>

<p>A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty</p>

<p>dish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Balthasar</sc></p>

<p>Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>And welcome more common, for that’s nothing but</p>

<p>words.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Balthasar</sc></p>

<p>Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry</p>

<p>feast.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.</p>

<p>But though my cates be mean, take them in good</p>

<p>part.</p>

<p>Better cheer may you have, but not with better</p>

<p>heart.     <i><i>[He attempts to open the door.]</i></i></p>

<p>But soft! My door is locked. <i>[To Dromio.]</i> Go, bid</p>

<p>them let us in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Maud, Bridget, Marian, Ciceley, Gillian, Ginn!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch!</p>

<p>Either get thee from the door or sit down at the</p>

<p>hatch.</p>

<p>Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call’st for</p>

<p>such store</p>

<p>When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the</p>

<p>door.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>What patch is made our porter? My master stays in</p>

<p>the street.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Let him walk from whence he came, lest he catch</p>

<p>cold on ’s feet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Who talks within there? Ho, open the door.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Right, sir, I’ll tell you when an you’ll tell me</p>

<p>wherefore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Wherefore? For my dinner. I have not dined today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Nor today here you must not. Come again when you</p>

<p>may.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I</p>

<p>owe?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>The porter for this time, sir, and my name is</p>

<p>Dromio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>O villain, thou hast stolen both mine office and my</p>

<p>name!</p>

<p>The one ne’er got me credit, the other mickle</p>

<p>blame.</p>

<p>If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place,</p>

<p>Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name, or</p>

<p>thy name for an ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Luce above, unseen by Antipholus of Ephesus</p>

<p>and his company.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luce</sc></p>

<p>What a coil is there, Dromio! Who are those at the</p>

<p>gate?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Let my master in, Luce.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luce</sc>  Faith, no, he comes too late,</p>

<p>And so tell your master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc>  O Lord, I must laugh.</p>

<p>Have at you with a proverb: shall I set in my staff?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luce</sc></p>

<p>Have at you with another: that’s–When, can you</p>

<p>tell?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>If thy name be called “Luce,” Luce, thou hast</p>

<p>answered him well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc> <i>[to Luce]</i></p>

<p>Do you hear, you minion? You’ll let us in, I hope?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luce</sc></p>

<p>I thought to have asked you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[within]</i>   <i>And you said no.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>So, come help. Well struck! There was blow for</p>

<p>blow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc> <i>[to Luce]</i></p>

<p>Thou baggage, let me in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luce</sc>  Can you tell for whose sake?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Master, knock the door hard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luce</sc>  Let him knock till it ache.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>You’ll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.</p>

<p><center><i>[He beats on the door.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Luce</sc></p>

<p>What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the</p>

<p>town?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Adriana, above, unseen by Antipholus of Ephesus</p>

<p>and his company.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>By my troth, your town is troubled with unruly</p>

<p>boys.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Are you there, wife? You might have come before.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Adriana</sc></p>

<p>Your wife, sir knave? Go, get you from the door.</p>

<p><center><i>[Adriana and Luce exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>If you went in pain, master, this knave would go</p>

<p>sore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc> <i>[to Antipholus of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome. We would</p>

<p>fain have either.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Balthasar</sc></p>

<p>In debating which was best, we shall part with</p>

<p>neither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>They stand at the door, master. Bid them welcome</p>

<p>hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>There is something in the wind, that we cannot get</p>

<p>in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>You would say so, master, if your garments were</p>

<p>thin.</p>

<p>Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in</p>

<p>the cold.</p>

<p>It would make a man mad as a buck to be so</p>

<p>bought and sold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Go, fetch me something. I’ll break ope the gate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Break any breaking here, and I’ll break your knave’s</p>

<p>pate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>A man may break a word with you, sir, and words</p>

<p>are but wind,</p>

<p>Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not</p>

<p>behind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>It seems thou want’st breaking. Out upon thee, hind!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Here’s too much “Out upon thee!” I pray thee, let</p>

<p>me in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Syracuse</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no</p>

<p>fin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc> <i>[to Dromio of Ephesus]</i></p>

<p>Well, I’ll break in. Go, borrow me a crow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dromio</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?</p>

<p>For a fish without a fin, there’s a fowl without a</p>

<p>feather.–</p>

<p>If a crow help us in, sirrah, we’ll pluck a crow</p>

<p>together.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Go, get thee gone. Fetch me an iron crow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Balthasar</sc></p>

<p>Have patience, sir. O, let it not be so.</p>

<p>Herein you war against your reputation,</p>

<p>And draw within the compass of suspect</p>

<p>Th’ unviolated honor of your wife.</p>

<p>Once this: your long experience of her wisdom,</p>

<p>Her sober virtue, years, and modesty</p>

<p>Plead on her part some cause to you unknown.</p>

<p>And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse</p>

<p>Why at this time the doors are made against you.</p>

<p>Be ruled by me; depart in patience,</p>

<p>And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,</p>

<p>And about evening come yourself alone</p>

<p>To know the reason of this strange restraint.</p>

<p>If by strong hand you offer to break in</p>

<p>Now in the stirring passage of the day,</p>

<p>A vulgar comment will be made of it;</p>

<p>And that supposed by the common rout</p>

<p>Against your yet ungalled estimation</p>

<p>That may with foul intrusion enter in</p>

<p>And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;</p>

<p>For slander lives upon succession,</p>

<p>Forever housed where it gets possession.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>You have prevailed. I will depart in quiet</p>

<p>And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.</p>

<p>I know a wench of excellent discourse,</p>

<p>Pretty and witty, wild and yet, too, gentle.</p>

<p>There will we dine. This woman that I mean,</p>

<p>My wife–but, I protest, without desert–</p>

<p>Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal;</p>

<p>To her will we to dinner. <i>[To Angelo.]</i> Get you home</p>

<p>And fetch the chain; by this, I know, ’tis made.</p>

<p>Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine,</p>

<p>For there’s the house. That chain will I bestow–</p>

<p>Be it for nothing but to spite my wife–</p>

<p>Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste.</p>

<p>Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,</p>

<p>I’ll knock elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Antipholus</sc> <sc>Of</sc> <sc>Ephesus</sc></p>

<p>Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.</p>
