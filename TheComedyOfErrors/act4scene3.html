<p><center><i>[Enter Antipholus of Syracuse, wearing the chain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me</p>

<p>As if I were their well-acquainted friend,</p>

<p>And everyone doth call me by my name.</p>

<p>Some tender money to me; some invite me;</p>

<p>Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;</p>

<p>Some offer me commodities to buy.</p>

<p>Even now a tailor called me in his shop</p>

<p>And showed me silks that he had bought for me,</p>

<p>And therewithal took measure of my body.</p>

<p>Sure these are but imaginary wiles,</p>

<p>And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dromio of Syracuse with the purse.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Master, here’s the gold you sent</p>

<p>me for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam</p>

<p>new-appareled?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Not that Adam that kept the</p>

<p>Paradise, but that Adam that keeps the prison; he</p>

<p>that goes in the calf’s skin that was killed for the</p>

<p>Prodigal; he that came behind you, sir, like an evil</p>

<p>angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  I understand thee not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  No? Why, ’tis a plain case: he</p>

<p>that went like a bass viol in a case of leather; the</p>

<p>man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives</p>

<p>them a sob and ’rests them; he, sir, that takes pity</p>

<p>on decayed men and gives them suits of durance; he</p>

<p>that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his</p>

<p>mace than a morris-pike.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  What, thou mean’st an</p>

<p>officer?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band;</p>

<p>he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his</p>

<p>band; one that thinks a man always going to bed</p>

<p>and says “God give you good rest.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Well, sir, there rest in your</p>

<p>foolery. Is there any ships puts forth tonight? May</p>

<p>we be gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Why, sir, I brought you word an</p>

<p>hour since that the bark Expedition put forth tonight,</p>

<p>and then were you hindered by the sergeant</p>

<p>to tarry for the hoy Delay. Here are the angels that</p>

<p>you sent for to deliver you.     <i><i>[He gives the purse.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>The fellow is distract, and so am I,</p>

<p>And here we wander in illusions.</p>

<p>Some blessed power deliver us from hence!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Courtesan.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Courtesan</span></p>

<p>Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.</p>

<p>I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.</p>

<p>Is that the chain you promised me today?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Master, is this Mistress Satan?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  It is the devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Nay, she is worse; she is the</p>

<p>devil’s dam, and here she comes in the habit of a</p>

<p>light wench. And thereof comes that the wenches</p>

<p>say “God damn me”; that’s as much to say “God</p>

<p>make me a light wench.” It is written they appear</p>

<p>to men like angels of light. Light is an effect of fire,</p>

<p>and fire will burn: ergo, light wenches will burn.</p>

<p>Come not near her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Courtesan</span></p>

<p>Your man and you are marvelous merry, sir.</p>

<p>Will you go with me? We’ll mend our dinner here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Master, if you do, expect spoon</p>

<p>meat, or bespeak a long spoon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Why, Dromio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Marry, he must have a long</p>

<p>spoon that must eat with the devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span> <i>[to the Courtesan]</i></p>

<p>Avoid then, fiend! What tell’st thou me of supping?</p>

<p>Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress.</p>

<p>I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Courtesan</span></p>

<p>Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner</p>

<p>Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,</p>

<p>And I’ll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  Some devils ask but the parings</p>

<p>of one’s nail, a rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, a</p>

<p>nut, a cherrystone; but she, more covetous, would</p>

<p>have a chain. Master, be wise. An if you give it her,</p>

<p>the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Courtesan</span></p>

<p>I pray you, sir, my ring or else the chain.</p>

<p>I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antipholus</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span></p>

<p>Avaunt, thou witch!–Come, Dromio, let us go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dromio</span> <span class='sc'>Of</span> <span class='sc'>Syracuse</span>  “Fly pride,” says the peacock.</p>

<p>Mistress, that you know.</p>

<p><center><i>[Antipholus and Dromio exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Courtesan</span></p>

<p>Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad;</p>

<p>Else would he never so demean himself.</p>

<p>A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,</p>

<p>And for the same he promised me a chain.</p>

<p>Both one and other he denies me now.</p>

<p>The reason that I gather he is mad,</p>

<p>Besides this present instance of his rage,</p>

<p>Is a mad tale he told today at dinner</p>

<p>Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.</p>

<p>Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,</p>

<p>On purpose shut the doors against his way.</p>

<p>My way is now to hie home to his house</p>

<p>And tell his wife that, being lunatic,</p>

<p>He rushed into my house and took perforce</p>

<p>My ring away. This course I fittest choose,</p>

<p>For forty ducats is too much to lose.</p>
