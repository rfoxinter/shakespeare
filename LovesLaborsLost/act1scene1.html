<p><center><i>[Enter Ferdinand, King of Navarre, Berowne,</p>

<p>Longaville, and Dumaine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,</p>

<p>Live registered upon our brazen tombs,</p>

<p>And then grace us in the disgrace of death,</p>

<p>When, spite of cormorant devouring time,</p>

<p>Th’ endeavor of this present breath may buy</p>

<p>That honor which shall bate his scythe’s keen edge</p>

<p>And make us heirs of all eternity.</p>

<p>Therefore, brave conquerors, for so you are</p>

<p>That war against your own affections</p>

<p>And the huge army of the world’s desires,</p>

<p>Our late edict shall strongly stand in force.</p>

<p>Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;</p>

<p>Our court shall be a little academe,</p>

<p>Still and contemplative in living art.</p>

<p>You three, Berowne, Dumaine, and Longaville,</p>

<p>Have sworn for three years’ term to live with me,</p>

<p>My fellow scholars, and to keep those statutes</p>

<p>That are recorded in this schedule here.</p>

<p><center><i>[He holds up a scroll.]</i></center></p>

<p>Your oaths are passed, and now subscribe your</p>

<p>names,</p>

<p>That his own hand may strike his honor down</p>

<p>That violates the smallest branch herein.</p>

<p>If you are armed to do as sworn to do,</p>

<p>Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>I am resolved. ’Tis but a three years’ fast.</p>

<p>The mind shall banquet though the body pine.</p>

<p>Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits</p>

<p>Make rich the ribs but bankrout quite the wits.</p>

<p><center><i>[He signs his name.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span></p>

<p>My loving lord, Dumaine is mortified.</p>

<p>The grosser manner of these world’s delights</p>

<p>He throws upon the gross world’s baser slaves.</p>

<p>To love, to wealth, to pomp I pine and die,</p>

<p>With all these living in philosophy.</p>

<p><center><i>[He signs his name.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>I can but say their protestation over.</p>

<p>So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,</p>

<p>That is, to live and study here three years.</p>

<p>But there are other strict observances:</p>

<p>As not to see a woman in that term,</p>

<p>Which I hope well is not enrolled there;</p>

<p>And one day in a week to touch no food,</p>

<p>And but one meal on every day besides,</p>

<p>The which I hope is not enrolled there;</p>

<p>And then to sleep but three hours in the night,</p>

<p>And not be seen to wink of all the day–</p>

<p>When I was wont to think no harm all night,</p>

<p>And make a dark night too of half the day–</p>

<p>Which I hope well is not enrolled there.</p>

<p>O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,</p>

<p>Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Your oath is passed to pass away from these.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Let me say no, my liege, an if you please.</p>

<p>I only swore to study with your Grace</p>

<p>And stay here in your court for three years’ space.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>By yea and nay, sir. Then I swore in jest.</p>

<p>What is the end of study, let me know?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Why, that to know which else we should not know.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Things hid and barred, you mean, from common</p>

<p>sense.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Ay, that is study’s godlike recompense.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Come on, then, I will swear to study so,</p>

<p>To know the thing I am forbid to know:</p>

<p>As thus–to study where I well may dine,</p>

<p>   <i>When I to feast expressly am forbid;</i></p>

<p>Or study where to meet some mistress fine</p>

<p>   <i>When mistresses from common sense are hid;</i></p>

<p>Or having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,</p>

<p>Study to break it, and not break my troth.</p>

<p>If study’s gain be thus, and this be so,</p>

<p>Study knows that which yet it doth not know.</p>

<p>Swear me to this, and I will ne’er say no.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>These be the stops that hinder study quite,</p>

<p>And train our intellects to vain delight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Why, all delights are vain, and that most vain</p>

<p>Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:</p>

<p>As painfully to pore upon a book</p>

<p>   <i>To seek the light of truth, while truth the while</i></p>

<p>Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.</p>

<p>   <i>Light seeking light doth light of light beguile.</i></p>

<p>So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,</p>

<p>Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.</p>

<p>Study me how to please the eye indeed</p>

<p>   <i>By fixing it upon a fairer eye,</i></p>

<p>Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed</p>

<p>   <i>And give him light that it was blinded by.</i></p>

<p>Study is like the heaven’s glorious sun,</p>

<p>   <i>That will not be deep-searched with saucy looks.</i></p>

<p>Small have continual plodders ever won,</p>

<p>   <i>Save base authority from others’ books.</i></p>

<p>These earthly godfathers of heaven’s lights,</p>

<p>   <i>That give a name to every fixed star,</i></p>

<p>Have no more profit of their shining nights</p>

<p>   <i>Than those that walk and wot not what they are.</i></p>

<p>Too much to know is to know naught but fame,</p>

<p>And every godfather can give a name.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>How well he’s read to reason against reading.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span></p>

<p>Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span></p>

<p>How follows that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Fit in his place and time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span></p>

<p>In reason nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Something then in rhyme.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost</p>

<p>   <i>That bites the firstborn infants of the spring.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Well, say I am. Why should proud summer boast</p>

<p>   <i>Before the birds have any cause to sing?</i></p>

<p>Why should I joy in any abortive birth?</p>

<p>At Christmas I no more desire a rose</p>

<p>Than wish a snow in May’s new-fangled shows,</p>

<p>But like of each thing that in season grows.</p>

<p>So you, to study now it is too late,</p>

<p>Climb o’er the house to unlock the little gate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Well, sit you out. Go home, Berowne. Adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>No, my good lord, I have sworn to stay with you.</p>

<p>And though I have for barbarism spoke more</p>

<p>   <i>Than for that angel knowledge you can say,</i></p>

<p>Yet, confident, I’ll keep what I have sworn</p>

<p>   <i>And bide the penance of each three years’ day.</i></p>

<p>Give me the paper. Let me read the same,</p>

<p>And to the strictest decrees I’ll write my name.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>How well this yielding rescues thee from shame.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span> <i>[reads]</i>  Item, That no woman shall come within</p>

<p>a mile of my court. Hath this been proclaimed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span>  Four days ago.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Let’s see the penalty. <i>[Reads:]</i> On pain of</p>

<p>losing her tongue. Who devised this penalty?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span>  Marry, that did I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Sweet lord, and why?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>To fright them hence with that dread penalty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>A dangerous law against gentility.</p>

<p><i>[Reads:]</i> Item, If any man be seen to talk with a</p>

<p>woman within the term of three years, he shall endure</p>

<p>such public shame as the rest of the court can possible</p>

<p>devise.</p>

<p>This article, my liege, yourself must break,</p>

<p>   <i>For well you know here comes in embassy</i></p>

<p>The French king’s daughter with yourself to speak–</p>

<p>   <i>A maid of grace and complete majesty–</i></p>

<p>About surrender up of Aquitaine</p>

<p>   <i>To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father.</i></p>

<p>Therefore this article is made in vain,</p>

<p>   <i>Or vainly comes th’ admired princess hither.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>So study evermore is overshot.</p>

<p>While it doth study to have what it would,</p>

<p>It doth forget to do the thing it should.</p>

<p>And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,</p>

<p>’Tis won as towns with fire–so won, so lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>We must of force dispense with this decree.</p>

<p>She must lie here on mere necessity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Necessity will make us all forsworn</p>

<p>   <i>Three thousand times within this three years’</i></p>

<p>   <i>space;</i></p>

<p>For every man with his affects is born,</p>

<p>   <i>Not by might mastered, but by special grace.</i></p>

<p>If I break faith, this word shall speak for me:</p>

<p>I am forsworn on mere necessity.</p>

<p>So to the laws at large I write my name,</p>

<p>   <i>And he that breaks them in the least degree</i></p>

<p>Stands in attainder of eternal shame.</p>

<p>   <i>Suggestions are to other as to me,</i></p>

<p>But I believe, although I seem so loath,</p>

<p>I am the last that will last keep his oath.</p>

<p><center><i>[He signs his name.]</i></center></p>

<p>But is there no quick recreation granted?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted</p>

<p>   <i>With a refined traveler of Spain,</i></p>

<p>A man in all the world’s new fashion planted,</p>

<p>   <i>That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;</i></p>

<p>One who the music of his own vain tongue</p>

<p>   <i>Doth ravish like enchanting harmony,</i></p>

<p>A man of compliments, whom right and wrong</p>

<p>   <i>Have chose as umpire of their mutiny.</i></p>

<p>This child of fancy, that Armado hight,</p>

<p>   <i>For interim to our studies shall relate</i></p>

<p>In high-born words the worth of many a knight</p>

<p>   <i>From tawny Spain lost in the world’s debate.</i></p>

<p>How you delight, my lords, I know not, I,</p>

<p>But I protest I love to hear him lie,</p>

<p>And I will use him for my minstrelsy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Armado is a most illustrious wight,</p>

<p>A man of fire-new words, fashion’s own knight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>Costard the swain and he shall be our sport,</p>

<p>And so to study three years is but short.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dull, a Constable, with a letter, and Costard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dull</span>  Which is the Duke’s own person?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  This, fellow. What wouldst?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dull</span>  I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his</p>

<p>Grace’s farborough. But I would see his own</p>

<p>person in flesh and blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  This is he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dull</span> <i>[to King]</i>  Signior Arm-, Arm-, commends you.</p>

<p>There’s villainy abroad. This letter will tell you</p>

<p>more.     <i><i>[He gives the letter to the King.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching</p>

<p>me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  A letter from the magnificent Armado.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  How low soever the matter, I hope in God</p>

<p>for high words.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span>  A high hope for a low heaven. God grant</p>

<p>us patience!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  To hear, or forbear hearing?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span>  To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately,</p>

<p>or to forbear both.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause</p>

<p>to climb in the merriness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  The matter is to me, sir, as concerning</p>

<p>Jaquenetta. The manner of it is, I was taken with</p>

<p>the manner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  In what manner?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  In manner and form following, sir, all those</p>

<p>three. I was seen with her in the manor house,</p>

<p>sitting with her upon the form, and taken following</p>

<p>her into the park, which, put together, is “in manner</p>

<p>and form following.” Now, sir, for the manner.</p>

<p>It is the manner of a man to speak to a woman. For</p>

<p>the form–in some form.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  For the “following,” sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  As it shall follow in my correction, and God</p>

<p>defend the right.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Will you hear this letter with attention?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  As we would hear an oracle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Such is the sinplicity of man to hearken after</p>

<p>the flesh.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[reads]</i>  Great deputy, the welkin’s vicegerent and</p>

<p>sole dominator of Navarre, my soul’s earth’s god, and</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[reads]</i>  So it is–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  It may be so, but if he say it is so, he is, in</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Be to me, and every man that dares not fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  No words.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Of other men’s secrets, I beseech you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[reads]</i>  So it is, besieged with sable-colored melancholy,</p>

<p>I did commend the black oppressing humor</p>

<p>to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving air;</p>

<p>time when? About the sixth hour, when beasts most</p>

<p>graze, birds best peck, and men sit down to that</p>

<p>nourishment which is called supper. So much for the</p>

<p>time when. Now for the ground which–which, I</p>

<p>mean, I walked upon. It is yclept thy park. Then for the</p>

<p>place where–where, I mean, I did encounter that</p>

<p>obscene and most prepost’rous event that draweth</p>

<p>from my snow-white pen the ebon-colored ink, which</p>

<p>here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest. But to</p>

<p>the place where. It standeth north-north-east and by</p>

<p>east from the west corner of thy curious-knotted</p>

<p>garden. There did I see that low-spirited swain, that</p>

<p>heat of duty,</p>

<p>Don Adriano de Armado.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  This is not so well as I looked for, but the</p>

<p>best that ever I heard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Ay, the best, for the worst. <i>[To Costard.]</i> But,</p>

<p>sirrah, what say you to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Sir, I confess the wench.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Did you hear the proclamation?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  I do confess much of the hearing it, but little</p>

<p>of the marking of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  It was proclaimed a year’s imprisonment to be</p>

<p>taken with a wench.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  I was taken with none, sir. I was taken with a</p>

<p>damsel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Well, it was proclaimed “damsel.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  This was no damsel neither, sir. She was a</p>

<p>virgin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed</p>

<p>“virgin.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  If it were, I deny her virginity. I was taken</p>

<p>with a maid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  This “maid” will not serve your turn, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  This maid will serve my turn, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall</p>

<p>fast a week with bran and water.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  I had rather pray a month with mutton and</p>

<p>porridge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  And Don Armado shall be your keeper.</p>

<p>My Lord Berowne, see him delivered o’er,</p>

<p>And go we, lords, to put in practice that</p>

<p>   <i>Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[King, Longaville, and Dumaine exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>I’ll lay my head to any goodman’s hat,</p>

<p>   <i>These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.</i></p>

<p>Sirrah, come on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is I was</p>

<p>taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true</p>

<p>girl. And therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity.</p>

<p>Affliction may one day smile again, and till</p>

<p>then, sit thee down, sorrow.</p>
