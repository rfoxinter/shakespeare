<p><center><i>[Enter the Ladies (the Princess, Rosaline,</p>

<p>Katherine, and Maria.)]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Sweethearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,</p>

<p>If fairings come thus plentifully in.</p>

<p>A lady walled about with diamonds!</p>

<p>Look you what I have from the loving king.</p>

<p><center><i>[She shows a jewel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Madam, came nothing else along with that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Nothing but this? Yes, as much love in rhyme</p>

<p>As would be crammed up in a sheet of paper</p>

<p>Writ o’ both sides the leaf, margent and all,</p>

<p>That he was fain to seal on Cupid’s name.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>That was the way to make his godhead wax,</p>

<p>For he hath been five thousand year a boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows, too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>You’ll ne’er be friends with him. He killed your</p>

<p>sister.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy,</p>

<p>And so she died. Had she been light like you,</p>

<p>Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,</p>

<p>She might ha’ been a grandam ere she died.</p>

<p>And so may you, for a light heart lives long.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>What’s your dark meaning, mouse, of this light</p>

<p>word?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>A light condition in a beauty dark.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>We need more light to find your meaning out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>You’ll mar the light by taking it in snuff;</p>

<p>Therefore I’ll darkly end the argument.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Look what you do, you do it still i’ th’ dark.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>So do not you, for you are a light wench.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Indeed, I weigh not you, and therefore light.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>You weigh me not? O, that’s you care not for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Great reason: for past care is still past cure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Well bandied both; a set of wit well played.</p>

<p>But, Rosaline, you have a favor too.</p>

<p>Who sent it? And what is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span>  I would you knew.</p>

<p>An if my face were but as fair as yours,</p>

<p>My favor were as great. Be witness this.</p>

<p><center><i>[She shows a gift.]</i></center></p>

<p>Nay, I have verses too, I thank Berowne;</p>

<p>The numbers true; and were the numb’ring too,</p>

<p>I were the fairest goddess on the ground.</p>

<p>I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.</p>

<p>O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  Anything like?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Much in the letters, nothing in the praise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Beauteous as ink: a good conclusion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Fair as a text B in a copybook.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor,</p>

<p>My red dominical, my golden letter.</p>

<p>O, that your face were not so full of O’s!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>A pox of that jest! And I beshrew all shrows.</p>

<p>But, Katherine, what was sent to you</p>

<p>From fair Dumaine?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Madam, this glove.     <i><i>[She shows the glove.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  Did he not send you twain?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  Yes, madam, and moreover,</p>

<p>Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,</p>

<p>A huge translation of hypocrisy,</p>

<p>Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span></p>

<p>This, and these pearls, to me sent Longaville.</p>

<p><center><i>[She shows a paper and pearls.]</i></center></p>

<p>The letter is too long by half a mile.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart</p>

<p>The chain were longer and the letter short?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span></p>

<p>Ay, or I would these hands might never part.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.</p>

<p>That same Berowne I’ll torture ere I go.</p>

<p>O, that I knew he were but in by th’ week,</p>

<p>How I would make him fawn, and beg, and seek,</p>

<p>And wait the season, and observe the times,</p>

<p>And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes,</p>

<p>And shape his service wholly to my hests,</p>

<p>And make him proud to make me proud that jests!</p>

<p>So pair-taunt-like would I o’ersway his state,</p>

<p>That he should be my fool, and I his fate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>None are so surely caught, when they are catched,</p>

<p>As wit turned fool. Folly in wisdom hatched</p>

<p>Hath wisdom’s warrant and the help of school,</p>

<p>And wit’s own grace to grace a learned fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>The blood of youth burns not with such excess</p>

<p>As gravity’s revolt to wantonness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span></p>

<p>Folly in fools bears not so strong a note</p>

<p>As fool’ry in the wise, when wit doth dote,</p>

<p>Since all the power thereof it doth apply</p>

<p>To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Boyet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>O, I am stabbed with laughter. Where’s her Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Thy news, Boyet?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span>  Prepare, madam, prepare.</p>

<p>Arm, wenches, arm. Encounters mounted are</p>

<p>Against your peace. Love doth approach, disguised,</p>

<p>Armed in arguments. You’ll be surprised.</p>

<p>Muster your wits, stand in your own defense,</p>

<p>Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they</p>

<p>That charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>Under the cool shade of a sycamore,</p>

<p>I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour.</p>

<p>When, lo, to interrupt my purposed rest,</p>

<p>Toward that shade I might behold addressed</p>

<p>The King and his companions. Warily</p>

<p>I stole into a neighbor thicket by,</p>

<p>And overheard what you shall overhear:</p>

<p>That, by and by, disguised, they will be here.</p>

<p>Their herald is a pretty knavish page</p>

<p>That well by heart hath conned his embassage.</p>

<p>Action and accent did they teach him there:</p>

<p>“Thus must thou speak,” and “thus thy body bear.”</p>

<p>And ever and anon they made a doubt</p>

<p>Presence majestical would put him out;</p>

<p>“For,” quoth the King, “an angel shalt thou see;</p>

<p>Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.”</p>

<p>The boy replied “An angel is not evil.</p>

<p>I should have feared her had she been a devil.”</p>

<p>With that, all laughed and clapped him on the</p>

<p>shoulder,</p>

<p>Making the bold wag by their praises bolder.</p>

<p>One rubbed his elbow thus, and fleered, and swore</p>

<p>A better speech was never spoke before.</p>

<p>Another with his finger and his thumb,</p>

<p>Cried “Via! We will do ’t, come what will come.”</p>

<p>The third he capered and cried “All goes well!”</p>

<p>The fourth turned on the toe, and down he fell.</p>

<p>With that, they all did tumble on the ground</p>

<p>With such a zealous laughter so profound</p>

<p>That in this spleen ridiculous appears,</p>

<p>To check their folly, passion’s solemn tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>But what, but what? Come they to visit us?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>They do, they do; and are appareled thus,</p>

<p>Like Muscovites, or Russians, as I guess.</p>

<p>Their purpose is to parley, to court, and dance,</p>

<p>And every one his love-feat will advance</p>

<p>Unto his several mistress–which they’ll know</p>

<p>By favors several which they did bestow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>And will they so? The gallants shall be tasked,</p>

<p>For, ladies, we will every one be masked,</p>

<p>And not a man of them shall have the grace,</p>

<p>Despite of suit, to see a lady’s face.</p>

<p>Hold, Rosaline, this favor thou shalt wear,</p>

<p>And then the King will court thee for his dear.</p>

<p>Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine.</p>

<p>So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.</p>

<p><center><i>[Princess and Rosaline exchange favors.]</i></center></p>

<p>And change you favors too. So shall your loves</p>

<p>Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.</p>

<p><center><i>[Katherine and Maria exchange favors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Come on, then, wear the favors most in sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span> <i>[to Princess]</i></p>

<p>But in this changing, what is your intent?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.</p>

<p>They do it but in mockery merriment,</p>

<p>And mock for mock is only my intent.</p>

<p>Their several counsels they unbosom shall</p>

<p>To loves mistook, and so be mocked withal</p>

<p>Upon the next occasion that we meet,</p>

<p>With visages displayed, to talk and greet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>But shall we dance, if they desire us to ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>No, to the death we will not move a foot,</p>

<p>Nor to their penned speech render we no grace,</p>

<p>But while ’tis spoke each turn away her face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>Why, that contempt will kill the speaker’s heart,</p>

<p>And quite divorce his memory from his part.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Therefore I do it, and I make no doubt</p>

<p>The rest will ne’er come in if he be out.</p>

<p>There’s no such sport as sport by sport o’erthrown,</p>

<p>To make theirs ours and ours none but our own.</p>

<p>So shall we stay, mocking intended game,</p>

<p>And they, well mocked, depart away with shame.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sound trumpet, within.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>The trumpet sounds. Be masked; the maskers come.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Ladies mask.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Blackamoors with music, the Boy with a speech,</p>

<p>the King, Berowne, and the rest of the Lords disguised.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span></p>

<p>All hail, the richest beauties on the Earth!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span></p>

<p>A holy parcel of the fairest dames</p>

<p><center><i>[The Ladies turn their backs to him.]</i></center></p>

<p>That ever turned their–backs–to mortal views.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Their eyes, villain, their eyes!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span></p>

<p>That ever turned their eyes to mortal views.</p>

<p>Out–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span>  True; out indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span></p>

<p>Out of your favors, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe</p>

<p>Not to behold–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Once to behold, rogue!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span></p>

<p>Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes–</p>

<p>With your sun-beamed eyes–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>They will not answer to that epithet.</p>

<p>You were best call it “daughter-beamed eyes.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span></p>

<p>They do not mark me, and that brings me out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Is this your perfectness? Begone, you rogue!</p>

<p><center><i>[Boy exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span> <i>[speaking as the Princess]</i></p>

<p>What would these strangers? Know their minds,</p>

<p>Boyet.</p>

<p>If they do speak our language, ’tis our will</p>

<p>That some plain man recount their purposes.</p>

<p>Know what they would.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span>  What would you with the</p>

<p>Princess?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span>  What would they, say they?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Why, that they have, and bid them so be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>She says you have it, and you may be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Say to her we have measured many miles</p>

<p>To tread a measure with her on this grass.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>They say that they have measured many a mile</p>

<p>To tread a measure with you on this grass.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>It is not so. Ask them how many inches</p>

<p>Is in one mile. If they have measured many,</p>

<p>The measure then of one is eas’ly told.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>If to come hither you have measured miles,</p>

<p>And many miles, the Princess bids you tell</p>

<p>How many inches doth fill up one mile.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Tell her we measure them by weary steps.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>She hears herself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span>  How many weary steps</p>

<p>Of many weary miles you have o’ergone</p>

<p>Are numbered in the travel of one mile?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>We number nothing that we spend for you.</p>

<p>Our duty is so rich, so infinite,</p>

<p>That we may do it still without account.</p>

<p>Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face</p>

<p>That we, like savages, may worship it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>My face is but a moon, and clouded too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!</p>

<p>Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to</p>

<p>shine,</p>

<p>Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>O vain petitioner, beg a greater matter!</p>

<p>Thou now requests but moonshine in the water.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.</p>

<p>Thou bidd’st me beg; this begging is not strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Play music, then. Nay, you must do it soon.</p>

<p><center><i>[Music begins.]</i></center></p>

<p>Not yet? No dance! Thus change I like the moon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>You took the moon at full, but now she’s changed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.</p>

<p>The music plays. Vouchsafe some motion to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Our ears vouchsafe it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  But your legs should do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Since you are strangers and come here by chance,</p>

<p>We’ll not be nice. Take hands. We will not dance.</p>

<p><center><i>[She offers her hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Why take we hands then?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span>  Only to part friends.–</p>

<p>Curtsy, sweethearts–and so the measure ends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>More measure of this measure! Be not nice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>We can afford no more at such a price.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Prize you yourselves. What buys your company?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Your absence only.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  That can never be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Then cannot we be bought. And so adieu–</p>

<p>Twice to your visor, and half once to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>If you deny to dance, let’s hold more chat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>In private, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  I am best pleased with that.</p>

<p><center><i>[They move aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span> <i>[to the Princess]</i></p>

<p>White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.</p>

<p>Metheglin, wort, and malmsey. Well run, dice!</p>

<p>There’s half a dozen sweets.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span> <i>[speaking as Katherine]</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  Fair lady–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  Say you so? Fair lord!</p>

<p>Take that for your “fair lady.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  Please it you</p>

<p>As much in private, and I’ll bid adieu.</p>

<p><center><i>[They move aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span> <i>[speaking as Maria]</i></p>

<p>What, was your vizard made without a tongue?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>I know the reason, lady, why you ask.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>O, for your reason! Quickly, sir, I long.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>You have a double tongue within your mask,</p>

<p>And would afford my speechless vizard half.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not veal a calf?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>A calf, fair lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  No, a fair Lord Calf.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>Let’s part the word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span>  No, I’ll not be your half.</p>

<p>Take all and wean it. It may prove an ox.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks.</p>

<p>Will you give horns, chaste lady? Do not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Then die a calf before your horns do grow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>One word in private with you ere I die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Bleat softly, then. The butcher hears you cry.</p>

<p><center><i>[They move aside.]</i></center></p>

<p>Twenty adieus, my frozen Muskovits.–</p>

<p>Are these the breed of wits so wondered at?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>   <i>Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puffed</i></p>

<p>Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>   <i>O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!</i></p>

<p>Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?</p>

<p>   <i>Or ever but in vizards show their faces?</i></p>

<p>This pert Berowne was out of count’nance quite.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>   <i>They were all in lamentable cases.</i></p>

<p>The King was weeping ripe for a good word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>   <i>Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span></p>

<p>Dumaine was at my service, and his sword.</p>

<p>   <i>“No point,” quoth I. My servant straight was</i></p>

<p>   <i>mute.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Lord Longaville said I came o’er his heart.</p>

<p>   <i>And trow you what he called me?</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>     <i>Qualm, perhaps.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Yes, in good faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  Go, sickness as thou art!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>   <i>Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.</i></p>

<p>But will you hear? The King is my love sworn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>   <i>And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>And Longaville was for my service born.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span></p>

<p>   <i>Dumaine is mine as sure as bark on tree.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear.</p>

<p>Immediately they will again be here</p>

<p>In their own shapes, for it can never be</p>

<p>They will digest this harsh indignity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Will they return?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span>  They will, they will, God knows,</p>

<p>And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows.</p>

<p>Therefore change favors, and when they repair,</p>

<p>Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>How “blow”? How “blow”? Speak to be understood.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>Fair ladies masked are roses in their bud.</p>

<p>Dismasked, their damask sweet commixture shown,</p>

<p>Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Avaunt, perplexity!–What shall we do</p>

<p>If they return in their own shapes to woo?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Good madam, if by me you’ll be advised,</p>

<p>Let’s mock them still, as well known as disguised.</p>

<p>Let us complain to them what fools were here,</p>

<p>Disguised like Muscovites in shapeless gear,</p>

<p>And wonder what they were, and to what end</p>

<p>Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penned,</p>

<p>And their rough carriage so ridiculous,</p>

<p>Should be presented at our tent to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>Ladies, withdraw. The gallants are at hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Whip to our tents, as roes runs o’er land.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Princess and the Ladies exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Fair sir, God save you. Where’s the Princess?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>Gone to her tent. Please it your Majesty</p>

<p>Command me any service to her thither?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>I will, and so will she, I know, my lord.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons peas,</p>

<p>And utters it again when God doth please.</p>

<p>He is wit’s peddler, and retails his wares</p>

<p>At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs.</p>

<p>And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,</p>

<p>Have not the grace to grace it with such show.</p>

<p>This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve.</p>

<p>Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve.</p>

<p>He can carve too, and lisp. Why, this is he</p>

<p>That kissed his hand away in courtesy.</p>

<p>This is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice,</p>

<p>That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice</p>

<p>In honorable terms. Nay, he can sing</p>

<p>A mean most meanly; and in ushering</p>

<p>Mend him who can. The ladies call him sweet.</p>

<p>The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet.</p>

<p>This is the flower that smiles on everyone</p>

<p>To show his teeth as white as whale’s bone;</p>

<p>And consciences that will not die in debt</p>

<p>Pay him the due of “honey-tongued Boyet.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,</p>

<p>   <i>“Fair” in “all hail” is foul, as I conceive.</i></p>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>   <i>Then wish me better. I will give you leave.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>We came to visit you, and purpose now</p>

<p>   <i>To lead you to our court. Vouchsafe it, then.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow.</p>

<p>   <i>Nor God nor I delights in perjured men.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Rebuke me not for that which you provoke.</p>

<p>   <i>The virtue of your eye must break my oath.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>You nickname virtue; “vice” you should have spoke,</p>

<p>   <i>For virtue’s office never breaks men’s troth.</i></p>

<p>Now by my maiden honor, yet as pure</p>

<p>   <i>As the unsullied lily, I protest,</i></p>

<p>A world of torments though I should endure,</p>

<p>   <i>I would not yield to be your house’s guest,</i></p>

<p>So much I hate a breaking cause to be</p>

<p>Of heavenly oaths vowed with integrity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>O, you have lived in desolation here,</p>

<p>   <i>Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Not so, my lord. It is not so, I swear.</p>

<p>   <i>We have had pastimes here and pleasant game.</i></p>

<p>A mess of Russians left us but of late.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>   <i>How, madam? Russians?</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>     <i>Ay, in truth, my lord.</i></p>

<p>Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>   <i>Madam, speak true.–It is not so, my lord.</i></p>

<p>My lady, to the manner of the days,</p>

<p>In courtesy gives undeserving praise.</p>

<p>We four indeed confronted were with four</p>

<p>In Russian habit. Here they stayed an hour</p>

<p>And talked apace; and in that hour, my lord,</p>

<p>They did not bless us with one happy word.</p>

<p>I dare not call them fools; but this I think:</p>

<p>When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>This jest is dry to me. Gentle sweet,</p>

<p>Your wits makes wise things foolish. When we greet,</p>

<p>With eyes’ best seeing, heaven’s fiery eye,</p>

<p>By light we lose light. Your capacity</p>

<p>Is of that nature that to your huge store</p>

<p>Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>I am a fool, and full of poverty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>But that you take what doth to you belong,</p>

<p>It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>O, I am yours, and all that I possess!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>All the fool mine?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  I cannot give you less.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Which of the vizards was it that you wore?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Where? When? What vizard? Why demand you this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>There; then; that vizard; that superfluous case</p>

<p>That hid the worse and showed the better face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[aside to Dumaine]</i></p>

<p>We were descried. They’ll mock us now downright.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span> <i>[aside to King]</i></p>

<p>Let us confess and turn it to a jest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span> <i>[to King]</i></p>

<p>Amazed, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Help, hold his brows! He’ll swoon!–Why look you</p>

<p>pale?</p>

<p>Seasick, I think, coming from Muscovy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.</p>

<p>   <i>Can any face of brass hold longer out?</i></p>

<p>Here stand I, lady. Dart thy skill at me.</p>

<p>   <i>Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout.</i></p>

<p>Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance.</p>

<p>   <i>Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit,</i></p>

<p>And I will wish thee nevermore to dance,</p>

<p>   <i>Nor nevermore in Russian habit wait.</i></p>

<p>O, never will I trust to speeches penned,</p>

<p>   <i>Nor to the motion of a schoolboy’s tongue,</i></p>

<p>Nor never come in vizard to my friend,</p>

<p>   <i>Nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper’s song.</i></p>

<p>Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,</p>

<p>   <i>Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,</i></p>

<p>Figures pedantical–these summer flies</p>

<p>   <i>Have blown me full of maggot ostentation.</i></p>

<p>I do forswear them, and I here protest</p>

<p>   <i>By this white glove–how white the hand, God</i></p>

<p>   <i>knows!–</i></p>

<p>Henceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed</p>

<p>   <i>In russet yeas and honest kersey noes.</i></p>

<p>And to begin: Wench, so God help me, law,</p>

<p>My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Sans “sans,” I pray you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Yet I have a trick</p>

<p>Of the old rage. Bear with me, I am sick;</p>

<p>I’ll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:</p>

<p>Write “Lord have mercy on us” on those three.</p>

<p>They are infected; in their hearts it lies.</p>

<p>They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes.</p>

<p>These lords are visited. You are not free,</p>

<p>For the Lord’s tokens on you do I see.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Our states are forfeit. Seek not to undo us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>It is not so, for how can this be true,</p>

<p>That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Peace, for I will not have to do with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span> <i>[to King, Longaville, and Dumaine]</i></p>

<p>Speak for yourselves. My wit is at an end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[to Princess]</i></p>

<p>Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression</p>

<p>Some fair excuse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  The fairest is confession.</p>

<p>Were not you here but even now, disguised?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Madam, I was.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  And were you well advised?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>I was, fair madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  When you then were here,</p>

<p>What did you whisper in your lady’s ear?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>That more than all the world I did respect her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Upon mine honor, no.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  Peace, peace, forbear!</p>

<p>Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Despise me when I break this oath of mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>I will, and therefore keep it.–Rosaline,</p>

<p>What did the Russian whisper in your ear?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear</p>

<p>As precious eyesight, and did value me</p>

<p>Above this world, adding thereto moreover</p>

<p>That he would wed me or else die my lover.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>God give thee joy of him! The noble lord</p>

<p>Most honorably doth uphold his word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>What mean you, madam? By my life, my troth,</p>

<p>I never swore this lady such an oath.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>By heaven, you did! And to confirm it plain,</p>

<p>You gave me this. <i>[She shows a token.]</i> But take it,</p>

<p>sir, again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>My faith and this the Princess I did give.</p>

<p>I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Pardon me, sir. This jewel did she wear.</p>

<p><center><i>[She points to Rosaline.]</i></center></p>

<p>And Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear.</p>

<p><i>[To Berowne.]</i> What, will you have me, or your pearl</p>

<p>again?     <i><i>[She shows the token.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Neither of either. I remit both twain.</p>

<p>I see the trick on ’t. Here was a consent,</p>

<p>Knowing aforehand of our merriment,</p>

<p>To dash it like a Christmas comedy.</p>

<p>Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight</p>

<p>zany,</p>

<p>Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some</p>

<p>Dick,</p>

<p>That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick</p>

<p>To make my lady laugh when she’s disposed,</p>

<p>Told our intents before; which once disclosed,</p>

<p>The ladies did change favors; and then we,</p>

<p>Following the signs, wooed but the sign of she.</p>

<p>Now, to our perjury to add more terror,</p>

<p>We are again forsworn in will and error.</p>

<p>Much upon this ’tis. <i>[To Boyet.]</i> And might not you</p>

<p>Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?</p>

<p>Do not you know my lady’s foot by th’ squier?</p>

<p>   <i>And laugh upon the apple of her eye?</i></p>

<p>And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,</p>

<p>   <i>Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?</i></p>

<p>You put our page out. Go, you are allowed.</p>

<p>Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.</p>

<p>You leer upon me, do you? There’s an eye</p>

<p>Wounds like a leaden sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,</p>

<p>sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount. For</p>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[reading the paper]</i>  Here is like to be a good</p>

<p>presence of Worthies. He presents Hector of Troy,</p>

<p>the swain Pompey the Great, the parish curate</p>

<p>Alexander, Armado’s page Hercules, the pedant</p>

<p>Judas Maccabaeus.</p>

<p>And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,</p>

<p>These four will change habits and present the other</p>

<p>five.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  There is five in the first show.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  You are deceived. ’Tis not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  “The Great.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span></p>

<p>It is “Great,” sir.–Pompey, surnamed the</p>

<p>Great,</p>

<p>That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make my</p>

<p>foe to sweat.</p>

<p>And traveling along this coast, I here am come by</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  ’Tis not so much worth, but I hope I was</p>

<p>perfect. I made a little fault in “Great.”</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Holofernes</span>  What is this?     <i><i>[He points to his own face.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span>  A cittern-head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  The head of a bodkin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  A death’s face in a ring.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span>  The face of an old Roman coin, scarce</p>

<p>seen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span>  The pommel of Caesar’s falchion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  The carved-bone face on a flask.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Saint George’s half-cheek in a brooch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  Ay, and in a brooch of lead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Holofernes</span>  You have put me out of countenance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  Though my mocks come home by me, I will</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span>  But is this Hector?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span>  His leg is too big for Hector’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  More calf, certain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span>  No, he is best endued in the small.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  This cannot be Hector.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  He’s a god or a painter, for he makes faces.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span></p>

<p>The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,</p>

<p>   <i>Gave Hector a gift–</i></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  No, cloven.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Peace!</p>

<p>The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,</p>

<p>   <i>Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion,</i></p>

<p>A man so breathed, that certain he would fight, yea,</p>

<p>   <i>From morn till night, out of his pavilion.</i></p>

<p>I am that flower–</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span>  I must rather give it the rein, for it runs</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  Ay, and Hector’s a greyhound.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  The sweet warman is dead and rotten. Sweet</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the</p>

<p>brags in her belly already. ’Tis yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Dost thou infamonize me among potentates?</p>

<p>Thou shalt die!</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  Hector will challenge him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Ay, if he have no more man’s blood in his</p>

<p>belly than will sup a flea.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me. I will</p>

<p>not combat in my shirt.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Sweet bloods, I both may and will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  What reason have you for ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt. I go</p>

<p>woolward for penance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span>  True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want</p>

<p>of linen; since when, I’ll be sworn, he wore none</p>

<p>but a dishclout of Jaquenetta’s, and that he wears</p>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Madam, not so. I do beseech you stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span> <i>[to Boyet]</i></p>

<p>Prepare, I say.–I thank you, gracious lords,</p>

<p>For all your fair endeavors, and entreat,</p>

<p>Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe</p>

<p>In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide</p>

<p>The liberal opposition of our spirits,</p>

<p>If overboldly we have borne ourselves</p>

<p>In the converse of breath; your gentleness</p>

<p>Was guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord.</p>

<p>A heavy heart bears not a humble tongue.</p>

<p>Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks</p>

<p>For my great suit so easily obtained.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>The extreme parts of time extremely forms</p>

<p>All causes to the purpose of his speed,</p>

<p>And often at his very loose decides</p>

<p>That which long process could not arbitrate.</p>

<p>And though the mourning brow of progeny</p>

<p>Forbid the smiling courtesy of love</p>

<p>The holy suit which fain it would convince,</p>

<p>Yet since love’s argument was first on foot,</p>

<p>Let not the cloud of sorrow jostle it</p>

<p>From what it purposed, since to wail friends lost</p>

<p>Is not by much so wholesome-profitable</p>

<p>As to rejoice at friends but newly found.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>I understand you not. My griefs are double.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief,</p>

<p>And by these badges understand the King:</p>

<p>For your fair sakes have we neglected time,</p>

<p>Played foul play with our oaths. Your beauty, ladies,</p>

<p>Hath much deformed us, fashioning our humors</p>

<p>Even to the opposed end of our intents.</p>

<p>And what in us hath seemed ridiculous–</p>

<p>As love is full of unbefitting strains,</p>

<p>All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,</p>

<p>Formed by the eye and therefore, like the eye,</p>

<p>Full of strange shapes, of habits, and of forms,</p>

<p>Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll</p>

<p>To every varied object in his glance;</p>

<p>Which parti-coated presence of loose love</p>

<p>Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,</p>

<p>Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,</p>

<p>Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,</p>

<p>Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,</p>

<p>Our love being yours, the error that love makes</p>

<p>Is likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false</p>

<p>By being once false forever to be true</p>

<p>To those that make us both–fair ladies, you.</p>

<p>And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,</p>

<p>Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>We have received your letters full of love;</p>

<p>Your favors, the ambassadors of love;</p>

<p>And in our maiden council rated them</p>

<p>At courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,</p>

<p>As bombast and as lining to the time.</p>

<p>But more devout than this in our respects</p>

<p>Have we not been, and therefore met your loves</p>

<p>In their own fashion, like a merriment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span></p>

<p>Our letters, madam, showed much more than jest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>So did our looks.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span>  We did not quote them so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Now, at the latest minute of the hour,</p>

<p>Grant us your loves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  A time, methinks, too short</p>

<p>To make a world-without-end bargain in.</p>

<p>No, no, my lord, your Grace is perjured much,</p>

<p>Full of dear guiltiness, and therefore this:</p>

<p>If for my love–as there is no such cause–</p>

<p>You will do aught, this shall you do for me:</p>

<p>Your oath I will not trust, but go with speed</p>

<p>To some forlorn and naked hermitage,</p>

<p>Remote from all the pleasures of the world.</p>

<p>There stay until the twelve celestial signs</p>

<p>Have brought about the annual reckoning.</p>

<p>If this austere insociable life</p>

<p>Change not your offer made in heat of blood;</p>

<p>If frosts and fasts, hard lodging, and thin weeds</p>

<p>Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,</p>

<p>But that it bear this trial, and last love;</p>

<p>Then, at the expiration of the year,</p>

<p>Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,</p>

<p><center><i>[She takes his hand.]</i></center></p>

<p>And by this virgin palm now kissing thine,</p>

<p>I will be thine. And till that instant shut</p>

<p>My woeful self up in a mourning house,</p>

<p>Raining the tears of lamentation</p>

<p>For the remembrance of my father’s death.</p>

<p>If this thou do deny, let our hands part,</p>

<p>Neither entitled in the other’s heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>If this, or more than this, I would deny,</p>

<p>   <i>To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,</i></p>

<p>With threefold love I wish you all these three.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span></p>

<p>O, shall I say “I thank you, gentle wife”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Not so, my lord. A twelvemonth and a day</p>

<p>I’ll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say.</p>

<p>Come when the King doth to my lady come;</p>

<p>Then, if I have much love, I’ll give you some.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span></p>

<p>I’ll serve thee true and faithfully till then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Katherine</span></p>

<p>Yet swear not, lest you be forsworn again.</p>

<p><center><i>[They step aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>What says Maria?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span>  At the twelvemonth’s end</p>

<p>I’ll change my black gown for a faithful friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Longaville</span></p>

<p>I’ll stay with patience, but the time is long.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span></p>

<p>The liker you; few taller are so young.</p>

<p><center><i>[They step aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span> <i>[to Rosaline]</i></p>

<p>Studies my lady? Mistress, look on me.</p>

<p>Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,</p>

<p>What humble suit attends thy answer there.</p>

<p>Impose some service on me for thy love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,</p>

<p>Before I saw you; and the world’s large tongue</p>

<p>Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,</p>

<p>Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,</p>

<p>Which you on all estates will execute</p>

<p>That lie within the mercy of your wit.</p>

<p>To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,</p>

<p>And therewithal to win me, if you please,</p>

<p>Without the which I am not to be won,</p>

<p>You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day</p>

<p>Visit the speechless sick, and still converse</p>

<p>With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,</p>

<p>With all the fierce endeavor of your wit,</p>

<p>To enforce the pained impotent to smile.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>To move wild laughter in the throat of death?</p>

<p>It cannot be, it is impossible.</p>

<p>Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Why, that’s the way to choke a gibing spirit,</p>

<p>Whose influence is begot of that loose grace</p>

<p>Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools.</p>

<p>A jest’s prosperity lies in the ear</p>

<p>Of him that hears it, never in the tongue</p>

<p>Of him that makes it. Then if sickly ears,</p>

<p>Deafed with the clamors of their own dear groans</p>

<p>Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,</p>

<p>And I will have you and that fault withal.</p>

<p>But if they will not, throw away that spirit,</p>

<p>And I shall find you empty of that fault,</p>

<p>Right joyful of your reformation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>A twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall,</p>

<p>I’ll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span> <i>[to King]</i></p>

<p>Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take my leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>No, madam, we will bring you on your way.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>Our wooing doth not end like an old play.</p>

<p>Jack hath not Jill. These ladies’ courtesy</p>

<p>Might well have made our sport a comedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,</p>

<p>And then ’twill end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  That’s too long for a play.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Braggart Armado.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Sweet Majesty, vouchsafe me–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Was not that Hector?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dumaine</span>  The worthy knight of Troy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I</p>

<p>am a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the</p>

<p>plow for her sweet love three year. But, most</p>

<p>esteemed Greatness, will you hear the dialogue that</p>

<p>the two learned men have compiled in praise of the</p>

<p>owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the</p>

<p>end of our show.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Call them forth quickly. We will do so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Holla! Approach.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter all.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>This side is Hiems, Winter; this Ver, the Spring; the</p>

<p>one maintained by the owl, th’ other by the cuckoo.</p>

<p>Ver, begin.</p>

<p>The Song.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Spring</span></p>

<p>     <i>When daisies pied and violets blue,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And lady-smocks all silver-white,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue</i></p>

<p>        <i>Do paint the meadows with delight,</i></p>

<p>     <i>The cuckoo then on every tree</i></p>

<p>     <i>Mocks married men; for thus sings he:</i></p>

<p>          <i>“Cuckoo!</i></p>

<p>     <i>Cuckoo, cuckoo!” O word of fear,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Unpleasing to a married ear.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And merry larks are plowmen’s clocks;</i></p>

<p>     <i>When turtles tread, and rooks and daws,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And maidens bleach their summer smocks;</i></p>

<p>     <i>The cuckoo then on every tree</i></p>

<p>     <i>Mocks married men, for thus sings he:</i></p>

<p>          <i>“Cuckoo!</i></p>

<p>     <i>Cuckoo, cuckoo!” O word of fear,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Unpleasing to a married ear.</i></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Winter</span></p>

<p>     <i>When icicles hang by the wall,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And Tom bears logs into the hall,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And milk comes frozen home in pail;</i></p>

<p>     <i>When blood is nipped, and ways be foul,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Then nightly sings the staring owl</i></p>

<p>     <i>“Tu-whit to-who.” A merry note,</i></p>

<p>     <i>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>When all aloud the wind doth blow,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And coughing drowns the parson’s saw,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And birds sit brooding in the snow,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And Marian’s nose looks red and raw;</i></p>

<p>     <i>When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Then nightly sings the staring owl</i></p>

<p>     <i>“Tu-whit to-who.” A merry note,</i></p>

<p>     <i>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</i></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  The words of Mercury are harsh after the</p>
