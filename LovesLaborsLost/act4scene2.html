<p><center><i>[Enter Dull the Constable, Holofernes the Pedant, and</p>

<p>Nathaniel the Curate.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  Very reverend sport, truly, and done in the</p>

<p>testimony of a good conscience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in</p>

<p>blood, ripe as the pomewater, who now hangeth</p>

<p>like a jewel in the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin,</p>

<p>the heaven, and anon falleth like a crab on the face</p>

<p>of terra, the soil, the land, the earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are</p>

<p>sweetly varied, like a scholar at the least. But, sir, I</p>

<p>assure you, it was a buck of the first head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dull</sc>  ’Twas not a haud credo, ’twas a pricket.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Most barbarous intimation! Yet a kind of</p>

<p>insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of explication;</p>

<p>facere, as it were, replication, or rather, ostentare, to</p>

<p>show, as it were, his inclination, after his undressed,</p>

<p>unpolished, uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or</p>

<p>rather unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion,</p>

<p>to insert again my haud credo for a deer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dull</sc>  I said the deer was not a haud credo, ’twas a</p>

<p>pricket.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Twice-sod simplicity, bis coctus!</p>

<p>O thou monster ignorance, how deformed dost thou</p>

<p>look!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc></p>

<p>Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred</p>

<p>in a book.</p>

<p>He hath not eat paper, as it were; he hath not drunk</p>

<p>ink. His intellect is not replenished. He is only an</p>

<p>animal, only sensible in the duller parts.</p>

<p>And such barren plants are set before us that we</p>

<p>thankful should be–</p>

<p>Which we of taste and feeling are–for those parts</p>

<p>that do fructify in us more than he.</p>

<p>For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet,</p>

<p>or a fool,</p>

<p>So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in</p>

<p>a school.</p>

<p>But omne bene, say I, being of an old father’s mind:</p>

<p>Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dull</sc></p>

<p>You two are bookmen. Can you tell me by your wit</p>

<p>What was a month old at Cain’s birth that’s not</p>

<p>five weeks old as yet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Dictynna, goodman Dull, Dictynna,</p>

<p>goodman Dull.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dull</sc>  What is “dictima”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc></p>

<p>A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc></p>

<p>The moon was a month old when Adam was no</p>

<p>more.</p>

<p>And raught not to five weeks when he came to</p>

<p>fivescore.</p>

<p>Th’ allusion holds in the exchange.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dull</sc>  ’Tis true indeed. The collusion holds in the</p>

<p>exchange.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  God comfort thy capacity! I say, th’ allusion</p>

<p>holds in the exchange.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dull</sc>  And I say the pollution holds in the exchange, for</p>

<p>the moon is never but a month old. And I say besides</p>

<p>that, ’twas a pricket that the Princess killed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal</p>

<p>epitaph on the death of the deer? And, to humor</p>

<p>the ignorant, call I the deer the Princess killed a</p>

<p>pricket.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it</p>

<p>shall please you to abrogate scurrility.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  I will something affect the letter, for it</p>

<p>argues facility.</p>

<p>The preyful princess pierced and pricked</p>

<p>a pretty pleasing pricket,</p>

<p>   <i>Some say a sore, but not a sore till now made</i></p>

<p>   <i>sore with shooting.</i></p>

<p>The dogs did yell. Put “l” to “sore,” then sorel</p>

<p>jumps from thicket,</p>

<p>   <i>Or pricket sore, or else sorel. The people fall</i></p>

<p>   <i>a-hooting.</i></p>

<p>If sore be sore, then “L” to “sore” makes fifty</p>

<p>sores o’ sorel.</p>

<p>Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one</p>

<p>more “L.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  A rare talent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dull</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  If a talent be a claw, look how he claws</p>

<p>him with a talent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  This is a gift that I have, simple, simple–</p>

<p>a foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms,</p>

<p>figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,</p>

<p>revolutions. These are begot in the ventricle</p>

<p>of memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater,</p>

<p>and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But</p>

<p>the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I</p>

<p>am thankful for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  Sir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may</p>

<p>my parishioners, for their sons are well tutored by</p>

<p>you, and their daughters profit very greatly under</p>

<p>you. You are a good member of the</p>

<p>commonwealth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Mehercle, if their sons be ingenious,</p>

<p>they shall want no instruction; if their daughters be</p>

<p>capable, I will put it to them. But Vir sapis qui pauca</p>

<p>loquitur. A soul feminine saluteth us.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Jaquenetta and the Clown Costard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaquenetta</sc> <i>[to Nathaniel]</i>  God give you good morrow,</p>

<p>Master Person.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Master Person, quasi pierce one. And</p>

<p>if one should be pierced, which is the one?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Costard</sc>  Marry, Master Schoolmaster, he that is likeliest</p>

<p>to a hogshead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Of piercing a hogshead! A good luster</p>

<p>of conceit in a turf of earth; fire enough for a flint,</p>

<p>pearl enough for a swine. ’Tis pretty, it is well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaquenetta</sc> <i>[to Nathaniel]</i>  Good Master Parson, be so</p>

<p>good as read me this letter. It was given me by</p>

<p>Costard, and sent me from Don Armado. I beseech</p>

<p>you, read it.</p>

<p><center><i>[She hands Nathaniel a paper, which he looks at.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Facile precor gelida quando peccas omnia sub umbra.</i></p>

<p>Ruminat–</p>

<p>and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I may speak of</p>

<p>thee as the traveler doth of Venice:</p>

<p>     <i>Venetia, Venetia,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Chi non ti vede, non ti pretia.</i></p>

<p>Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! Who understandeth</p>

<p>thee not, loves thee not. <i>[(He sings.)]</i> Ut, re, sol, la,</p>

<p>mi, fa. <i>[(To Nathaniel.)]</i> Under pardon, sir, what are</p>

<p>the contents? Or rather, as Horace says in his–</p>

<p><i>[(Looking at the letter.)]</i> What, my soul, verses?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  Ay, sir, and very learned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>   <i>Let me hear a staff, a stanza, a verse,</i></p>

<p>Lege, domine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc> <i>[reads]</i></p>

<p>     <i>If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?</i></p>

<p>        <i>Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed!</i></p>

<p>     <i>Though to myself forsworn, to thee I’ll faithful prove.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like osiers</i></p>

<p>   <i>bowed.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Where all those pleasures live that art would</i></p>

<p>   <i>comprehend.</i></p>

<p>     <i>If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Well-learned is that tongue that well can thee</i></p>

<p>   <i>commend.</i></p>

<p>     <i>All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;</i></p>

<p>        <i>Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Thy eye Jove’s lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful</i></p>

<p>thunder,</p>

<p>        <i>Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Celestial as thou art, O, pardon love this wrong,</i></p>

<p>     <i>That sings heaven’s praise with such an earthly tongue.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  You find not the apostrophus, and so</p>

<p>miss the accent. Let me supervise the canzonet.</p>

<p><i>[He takes the paper.]</i> Here are only numbers ratified,</p>

<p>but, for the elegancy, facility, and golden cadence of</p>

<p>poesy–caret. Ovidius Naso was the man. And why</p>

<p>indeed “Naso,” but for smelling out the odoriferous</p>

<p>flowers of fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is</p>

<p>nothing: so doth the hound his master, the ape his</p>

<p>keeper, the tired horse his rider.–But damosella</p>

<p>virgin, was this directed to you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaquenetta</sc>  Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Berowne, one</p>

<p>of the strange queen’s lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  I will overglance the superscript: “To</p>

<p>the snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady</p>

<p>Rosaline.” I will look again on the intellect of the</p>

<p>letter for the nomination of the party writing to</p>

<p>the person written unto: “Your Ladyship’s in all</p>

<p>desired employment, Berowne.” Sir Nathaniel, this</p>

<p>Berowne is one of the votaries with the King, and</p>

<p>here he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the</p>

<p>stranger queen’s: which accidentally, or by the way</p>

<p>of progression, hath miscarried. <i>[To Jaquenetta.]</i></p>

<p>Trip and go, my sweet. Deliver this paper into the</p>

<p>royal hand of the King. It may concern much. Stay</p>

<p>not thy compliment. I forgive thy duty. Adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaquenetta</sc>  Good Costard, go with me.–Sir, God</p>

<p>save your life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Costard</sc>  Have with thee, my girl.</p>

<p><center><i>[Costard and Jaquenetta exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  Sir, you have done this in the fear of God</p>

<p>very religiously; and, as a certain Father saith–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Sir, tell not me of the Father. I do fear</p>

<p>colorable colors. But to return to the verses: did</p>

<p>they please you, Sir Nathaniel?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  Marvelous well for the pen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  I do dine today at the father’s of a certain</p>

<p>pupil of mine, where if, before repast, it shall</p>

<p>please you to gratify the table with a grace, I will,</p>

<p>on my privilege I have with the parents of the</p>

<p>foresaid child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto;</p>

<p>where I will prove those verses to be very unlearned,</p>

<p>neither savoring of poetry, wit, nor invention.</p>

<p>I beseech your society.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  And thank you too; for society, saith the</p>

<p>text, is the happiness of life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  And certes the text most infallibly concludes</p>

<p>it. <i>[To Dull.]</i> Sir, I do invite you too. You shall</p>

<p>not say me nay. Pauca verba. Away! The gentles are</p>

<p>at their game, and we will to our recreation.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
