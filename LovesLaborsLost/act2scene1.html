<p><center><i>[Enter the Princess of France, with three attending</p>

<p>Ladies (Rosaline, Maria, and Katherine), Boyet</p>

<p>and other Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits.</p>

<p>Consider who the King your father sends,</p>

<p>To whom he sends, and what’s his embassy.</p>

<p>Yourself, held precious in the world’s esteem,</p>

<p>To parley with the sole inheritor</p>

<p>Of all perfections that a man may owe,</p>

<p>Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight</p>

<p>Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.</p>

<p>Be now as prodigal of all dear grace</p>

<p>As nature was in making graces dear</p>

<p>When she did starve the general world besides</p>

<p>And prodigally gave them all to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,</p>

<p>Needs not the painted flourish of your praise.</p>

<p>Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye,</p>

<p>Not uttered by base sale of chapmen’s tongues.</p>

<p>I am less proud to hear you tell my worth</p>

<p>Than you much willing to be counted wise</p>

<p>In spending your wit in the praise of mine.</p>

<p>But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,</p>

<p>You are not ignorant all-telling fame</p>

<p>Doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow,</p>

<p>Till painful study shall outwear three years,</p>

<p>No woman may approach his silent court.</p>

<p>Therefore to ’s seemeth it a needful course,</p>

<p>Before we enter his forbidden gates,</p>

<p>To know his pleasure, and in that behalf,</p>

<p>Bold of your worthiness, we single you</p>

<p>As our best-moving fair solicitor.</p>

<p>Tell him the daughter of the King of France</p>

<p>On serious business craving quick dispatch,</p>

<p>Importunes personal conference with his Grace.</p>

<p>Haste, signify so much, while we attend,</p>

<p>Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>Proud of employment, willingly I go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.</p>

<p><center><i>[Boyet exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Who are the votaries, my loving lords,</p>

<p>That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?</p>

<br/>

<p>A <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Lord Longaville is one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc>  Know you the man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maria</sc></p>

<p>I know him, madam. At a marriage feast</p>

<p>Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir</p>

<p>Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized</p>

<p>In Normandy, saw I this Longaville.</p>

<p>A man of sovereign parts he is esteemed,</p>

<p>Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms.</p>

<p>Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.</p>

<p>The only soil of his fair virtue’s gloss,</p>

<p>If virtue’s gloss will stain with any soil,</p>

<p>Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will,</p>

<p>Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills</p>

<p>It should none spare that come within his power.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>Some merry mocking lord, belike. Is ’t so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maria</sc></p>

<p>They say so most that most his humors know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.</p>

<p>Who are the rest?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>The young Dumaine, a well-accomplished youth,</p>

<p>Of all that virtue love for virtue loved.</p>

<p>Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;</p>

<p>For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,</p>

<p>And shape to win grace though he had no wit.</p>

<p>I saw him at the Duke Alanson’s once,</p>

<p>And much too little of that good I saw</p>

<p>Is my report to his great worthiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc></p>

<p>Another of these students at that time</p>

<p>Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.</p>

<p>Berowne they call him, but a merrier man,</p>

<p>Within the limit of becoming mirth,</p>

<p>I never spent an hour’s talk withal.</p>

<p>His eye begets occasion for his wit,</p>

<p>For every object that the one doth catch</p>

<p>The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,</p>

<p>Which his fair tongue, conceit’s expositor,</p>

<p>Delivers in such apt and gracious words</p>

<p>That aged ears play truant at his tales,</p>

<p>And younger hearings are quite ravished,</p>

<p>So sweet and voluble is his discourse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>God bless my ladies, are they all in love,</p>

<p>That every one her own hath garnished</p>

<p>With such bedecking ornaments of praise?</p>

<br/>

<p>A <sc>Lord</sc></p>

<p>Here comes Boyet.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Boyet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc>  Now, what admittance, lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>Navarre had notice of your fair approach,</p>

<p>And he and his competitors in oath</p>

<p>Were all addressed to meet you, gentle lady,</p>

<p>Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learned:</p>

<p>He rather means to lodge you in the field,</p>

<p>Like one that comes here to besiege his court,</p>

<p>Than seek a dispensation for his oath</p>

<p>To let you enter his unpeopled house.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King of Navarre, Longaville, Dumaine, and</p>

<p>Berowne.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes Navarre.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Fair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc>  “Fair” I give you back again, and “welcome”</p>

<p>I have not yet. The roof of this court is too</p>

<p>high to be yours, and welcome to the wide fields too</p>

<p>base to be mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>I will be welcome, then. Conduct me thither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Hear me, dear lady. I have sworn an oath.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>Our Lady help my lord! He’ll be forsworn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>Why, will shall break it, will and nothing else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Your Ladyship is ignorant what it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,</p>

<p>Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.</p>

<p>I hear your Grace hath sworn out housekeeping.</p>

<p>’Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,</p>

<p>And sin to break it.</p>

<p>But pardon me, I am too sudden bold.</p>

<p>To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.</p>

<p>Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,</p>

<p>And suddenly resolve me in my suit.</p>

<p><center><i>[She gives him a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>You will the sooner that I were away,</p>

<p>For you’ll prove perjured if you make me stay.</p>

<p><center><i>[They walk aside while the King reads the paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[to Rosaline]</i></p>

<p>Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc></p>

<p>Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>I know you did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc>  How needless was it then</p>

<p>To ask the question.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  You must not be so quick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc></p>

<p>’Tis long of you that spur me with such questions.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>Your wit’s too hot, it speeds too fast; ’twill tire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc></p>

<p>Not till it leave the rider in the mire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>What time o’ day?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc>  The hour that fools should ask.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  Now fair befall your mask.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc>  Fair fall the face it covers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  And send you many lovers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc>  Amen, so you be none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  Nay, then, will I be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[coming forward with the Princess]</i></p>

<p>Madam, your father here doth intimate</p>

<p>The payment of a hundred thousand crowns,</p>

<p>Being but the one half of an entire sum</p>

<p>Disbursed by my father in his wars.</p>

<p>But say that he or we, as neither have,</p>

<p>Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid</p>

<p>A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which</p>

<p>One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,</p>

<p>Although not valued to the money’s worth.</p>

<p>If then the King your father will restore</p>

<p>But that one half which is unsatisfied,</p>

<p>We will give up our right in Aquitaine,</p>

<p>And hold fair friendship with his Majesty.</p>

<p>But that, it seems, he little purposeth;</p>

<p>For here he doth demand to have repaid</p>

<p>A hundred thousand crowns, and not demands,</p>

<p>On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,</p>

<p>To have his title live in Aquitaine–</p>

<p>Which we much rather had depart withal,</p>

<p>And have the money by our father lent,</p>

<p>Than Aquitaine, so gelded as it is.</p>

<p>Dear Princess, were not his requests so far</p>

<p>From reason’s yielding, your fair self should make</p>

<p>A yielding ’gainst some reason in my breast,</p>

<p>And go well satisfied to France again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>You do the King my father too much wrong,</p>

<p>And wrong the reputation of your name,</p>

<p>In so unseeming to confess receipt</p>

<p>Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>I do protest I never heard of it;</p>

<p>And if you prove it, I’ll repay it back</p>

<p>Or yield up Aquitaine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc>  We arrest your word.–</p>

<p>Boyet, you can produce acquittances</p>

<p>For such a sum from special officers</p>

<p>Of Charles his father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Satisfy me so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>So please your Grace, the packet is not come</p>

<p>Where that and other specialties are bound.</p>

<p>Tomorrow you shall have a sight of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>It shall suffice me; at which interview</p>

<p>All liberal reason I will yield unto.</p>

<p>Meantime receive such welcome at my hand</p>

<p>As honor (without breach of honor) may</p>

<p>Make tender of to thy true worthiness.</p>

<p>You may not come, fair princess, within my gates,</p>

<p>But here without you shall be so received</p>

<p>As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,</p>

<p>Though so denied fair harbor in my house.</p>

<p>Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell.</p>

<p>Tomorrow shall we visit you again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>Sweet health and fair desires consort your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Thy own wish wish I thee in every place.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with Dumaine,</p>

<p>Longaville, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[to Rosaline]</i>  Lady, I will commend you to</p>

<p>my own heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc>  Pray you, do my commendations. I would</p>

<p>be glad to see it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  I would you heard it groan.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc>  Is the fool sick?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  Sick at the heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc>  Alack, let it blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  Would that do it good?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc>  My physic says “ay.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  Will you prick ’t with your eye?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc>  No point, with my knife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  Now God save thy life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc>  And yours from long living.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  I cannot stay thanksgiving.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dumaine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc> <i>[to Boyet]</i></p>

<p>Sir, I pray you, a word. What lady is that same?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>The heir of Alanson, Katherine her name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>A gallant lady, monsieur. Fare you well.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Longaville.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc> <i>[to Boyet]</i></p>

<p>I beseech you, a word. What is she in the white?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc></p>

<p>Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a</p>

<p>shame.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc>  Pray you, sir, whose daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc>  Her mother’s, I have heard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc>  God’s blessing on your beard!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc>  Good sir, be not offended. She is an heir of</p>

<p>Falconbridge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc>  Nay, my choler is ended. She is a most</p>

<p>sweet lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc>  Not unlike, sir, that may be.</p>

<p><center><i>[Longaville exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Berowne.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[to Boyet]</i>  What’s her name in the cap?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc>  Rosaline, by good hap.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  Is she wedded or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc>  To her will, sir, or so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  You are welcome, sir. Adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc>  Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Berowne exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maria</sc></p>

<p>That last is Berowne, the merry madcap lord.</p>

<p>Not a word with him but a jest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc>  And every jest but</p>

<p>a word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>It was well done of you to take him at his word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>Two hot sheeps, marry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc>  And wherefore not ships?</p>

<p>No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>You sheep and I pasture. Shall that finish the jest?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>So you grant pasture for me.     <i><i>[He tries to kiss her.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  Not so, gentle beast,</p>

<p>My lips are no common, though several they be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>Belonging to whom?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc>  To my fortunes and me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc></p>

<p>Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree,</p>

<p>This civil war of wits were much better used</p>

<p>On Navarre and his bookmen, for here ’tis abused.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>If my observation, which very seldom lies,</p>

<p>By the heart’s still rhetoric, disclosed wi’ th’ eyes,</p>

<p>Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc>  With what?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>With that which we lovers entitle “affected.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc>  Your reason?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>Why, all his behaviors did make their retire</p>

<p>To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire.</p>

<p>His heart like an agate with your print impressed,</p>

<p>Proud with his form, in his eye pride expressed.</p>

<p>His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,</p>

<p>Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;</p>

<p>All senses to that sense did make their repair,</p>

<p>To feel only looking on fairest of fair.</p>

<p>Methought all his senses were locked in his eye,</p>

<p>As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy,</p>

<p>Who, tend’ring their own worth from where they</p>

<p>were glassed,</p>

<p>Did point you to buy them along as you passed.</p>

<p>His face’s own margent did quote such amazes</p>

<p>That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.</p>

<p>I’ll give you Aquitaine, and all that is his,</p>

<p>An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Princess</sc> <i>[to her Ladies]</i></p>

<p>Come, to our pavilion. Boyet is disposed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>But to speak that in words which his eye hath</p>

<p>disclosed.</p>

<p>I only have made a mouth of his eye</p>

<p>By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maria</sc></p>

<p>Thou art an old lovemonger and speakest skillfully.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Katherine</sc></p>

<p>He is Cupid’s grandfather, and learns news of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosaline</sc></p>

<p>Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is</p>

<p>but grim.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc></p>

<p>Do you hear, my mad wenches?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maria</sc>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc>  What then, do</p>

<p>you see?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Maria</sc></p>

<p>Ay, our way to be gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boyet</sc>  You are too hard for me.</p>
