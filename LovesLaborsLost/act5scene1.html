<p><center><i>[Enter Holofernes the Pedant, Nathaniel the Curate,</p>

<p>and Dull the Constable.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Satis quid sufficit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  I praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at</p>

<p>dinner have been sharp and sententious, pleasant</p>

<p>without scurrility, witty without affection, audacious</p>

<p>without impudency, learned without opinion,</p>

<p>and strange without heresy. I did converse this</p>

<p>quondam day with a companion of the King’s, who</p>

<p>is intituled, nominated, or called Don Adriano de</p>

<p>Armado.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Novi hominem tanquam te. His humor</p>

<p>is lofty, his discourse peremptory, his tongue filed,</p>

<p>his eye ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general</p>

<p>behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is</p>

<p>too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it</p>

<p>were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  A most singular and choice epithet.</p>

<p><center><i>[Draw out his table book.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  He draweth out the thread of his verbosity</p>

<p>finer than the staple of his argument. I abhor</p>

<p>such fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and</p>

<p>point-devise companions, such rackers of orthography,</p>

<p>as to speak “dout,” fine, when he should</p>

<p>say “doubt”; “det” when he should pronounce</p>

<p>“debt”–d, e, b, t, not d, e, t. He clepeth a calf</p>

<p>“cauf,” half “hauf,” neighbor vocatur “nebor”;</p>

<p>neigh abbreviated ne. This is abhominable–which</p>

<p>he would call “abominable.” It insinuateth me of</p>

<p>insanie. Ne intelligis, domine? To make frantic,</p>

<p>lunatic.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  Laus Deo, bone intelligo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Bone? Bone for bene? Priscian a little</p>

<p>scratched; ’twill serve.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Armado the Braggart, Boy, and Costard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  Videsne quis venit?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Video, et gaudeo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Chirrah.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Quare “chirrah,” not “sirrah”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Men of peace, well encountered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Most military sir, salutation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc> <i>[aside to Costard]</i>  They have been at a great feast</p>

<p>of languages and stolen the scraps.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Costard</sc> <i>[aside to Boy]</i>  O, they have lived long on the</p>

<p>almsbasket of words. I marvel thy master hath not</p>

<p>eaten thee for a word, for thou art not so long by the</p>

<p>head as honorificabilitudinitatibus. Thou art easier</p>

<p>swallowed than a flapdragon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc> <i>[aside to Costard]</i>  Peace, the peal begins.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc> <i>[to Holofernes]</i>  Monsieur, are you not</p>

<p>lettered?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Yes, yes, he teaches boys the hornbook.–What is</p>

<p>a, b spelled backward, with the horn on his head?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Ba, most silly sheep, with a horn.–You hear his</p>

<p>learning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Quis, quis, thou consonant?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  The last of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or</p>

<p>the fifth, if I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  I will repeat them: a, e, i–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  The sheep. The other two concludes it: o, u.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Now by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum,</p>

<p>a sweet touch, a quick venue of wit! Snip, snap,</p>

<p>quick and home. It rejoiceth my intellect. True</p>

<p>wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Offered by a child to an old man–which is</p>

<p>wit-old.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  What is the figure? What is the figure?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Horns.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Thou disputes like an infant. Go whip thy</p>

<p>gig.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip</p>

<p>about your infamy–unum cita–a gig of a cuckold’s</p>

<p>horn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Costard</sc>  An I had but one penny in the world, thou</p>

<p>shouldst have it to buy gingerbread! Hold, there is</p>

<p>the very remuneration I had of thy master, thou</p>

<p>halfpenny purse of wit, thou pigeon egg of discretion.</p>

<p><i>[He gives him money.]</i> O, an the heavens were</p>

<p>so pleased that thou wert but my bastard, what a</p>

<p>joyful father wouldest thou make me! Go to, thou</p>

<p>hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers’ ends, as they say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Oh, I smell false Latin! Dunghill for</p>

<p>unguem.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Arts-man, preambulate. We will be singuled</p>

<p>from the barbarous. Do you not educate youth at</p>

<p>the charge-house on the top of the mountain?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Or mons, the hill.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  I do, sans question.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Sir, it is the King’s most sweet pleasure and</p>

<p>affection to congratulate the Princess at her pavilion</p>

<p>in the posteriors of this day, which the rude</p>

<p>multitude call the afternoon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  “The posterior of the day,” most generous</p>

<p>sir, is liable, congruent, and measurable for</p>

<p>“the afternoon”; the word is well culled, chose,</p>

<p>sweet, and apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Sir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my</p>

<p>familiar, I do assure you, very good friend. For</p>

<p>what is inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech</p>

<p>thee, remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee apparel</p>

<p>thy head. And among other important and most</p>

<p>serious designs, and of great import indeed, too–</p>

<p>but let that pass; for I must tell thee, it will please his</p>

<p>Grace, by the world, sometimes to lean upon my</p>

<p>poor shoulder and with his royal finger thus dally</p>

<p>with my excrement, with my mustachio–but,</p>

<p>sweetheart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no</p>

<p>fable! Some certain special honors it pleaseth his</p>

<p>Greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of</p>

<p>travel, that hath seen the world–but let that pass.</p>

<p>The very all of all is–but sweetheart, I do implore</p>

<p>secrecy–that the King would have me present the</p>

<p>Princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation,</p>

<p>or show, or pageant, or antic, or firework.</p>

<p>Now, understanding that the curate and your sweet</p>

<p>self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking</p>

<p>out of mirth, as it were, I have acquainted you</p>

<p>withal to the end to crave your assistance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Sir, you shall present before her the Nine</p>

<p>Worthies.–Sir Nathaniel, as concerning some</p>

<p>entertainment of time, some show in the posterior</p>

<p>of this day, to be rendered by our assistance, the</p>

<p>King’s command, and this most gallant, illustrate,</p>

<p>and learned gentleman, before the Princess–I say,</p>

<p>none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nathaniel</sc>  Where will you find men worthy enough to</p>

<p>present them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Joshua, yourself; myself; and this gallant</p>

<p>gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus. This swain, because</p>

<p>of his great limb or joint, shall pass Pompey</p>

<p>the Great; the page, Hercules–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Pardon, sir–error. He is not quantity</p>

<p>enough for that Worthy’s thumb; he is not so big as</p>

<p>the end of his club!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Shall I have audience? He shall present</p>

<p>Hercules in minority. His enter and exit shall be</p>

<p>strangling a snake; and I will have an apology for</p>

<p>that purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  An excellent device. So, if any of the audience</p>

<p>hiss, you may cry “Well done, Hercules, now thou</p>

<p>crushest the snake.” That is the way to make an</p>

<p>offense gracious, though few have the grace to do it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  For the rest of the Worthies?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  I will play three myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Thrice-worthy gentleman!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc> <i>[to Holofernes]</i>  Shall I tell you a thing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  We attend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  We will have, if this fadge not, an antic. I</p>

<p>beseech you, follow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Via, goodman Dull. Thou hast spoken no</p>

<p>word all this while.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dull</sc>  Nor understood none neither, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Allons! We will employ thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dull</sc>  I’ll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play on</p>

<p>the tabor to the Worthies and let them dance the</p>

<p>hay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holofernes</sc>  Most dull, honest Dull. To our sport!</p>

<p>Away.</p>
