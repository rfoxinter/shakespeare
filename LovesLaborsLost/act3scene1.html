<p><center><i>[Enter Braggart Armado and his Boy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Warble, child, make passionate my sense of</p>

<p>hearing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span> <i>[sings]</i>  Concolinel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Sweet air. Go, tenderness of years. <i>[He hands</p>

<p>over a key.]</i> Take this key, give enlargement to the</p>

<p>swain, bring him festinately hither. I must employ</p>

<p>him in a letter to my love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  Master, will you win your love with a French</p>

<p>brawl?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  How meanest thou? Brawling in French?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  No, my complete master, but to jig off a tune at the</p>

<p>tongue’s end, canary to it with your feet, humor it</p>

<p>with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and sing a</p>

<p>note, sometimes through the throat as if you</p>

<p>swallowed love with singing love, sometimes</p>

<p>through the nose as if you snuffed up love by</p>

<p>smelling love; with your hat penthouse-like o’er the</p>

<p>shop of your eyes, with your arms crossed on your</p>

<p>thin-belly doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your</p>

<p>hands in your pocket like a man after the old</p>

<p>painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a</p>

<p>snip and away. These are compliments, these are</p>

<p>humors; these betray nice wenches that would be</p>

<p>betrayed without these, and make them men of</p>

<p>note–do you note me?–that most are affected</p>

<p>to these.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  How hast thou purchased this experience?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  By my penny of observation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  But O– but O–.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  “The hobby-horse is forgot.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Call’st thou my love “hobby-horse”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  No, master. The hobby-horse is but a colt, <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>and your love perhaps a hackney.–But have you</p>

<p>forgot your love?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Almost I had.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  Negligent student, learn her by heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  By heart and in heart, boy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  And out of heart, master. All those three I will</p>

<p>prove.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  What wilt thou prove?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  A man, if I live; and this “by, in, and without,”</p>

<p>upon the instant: “by” heart you love her, because</p>

<p>your heart cannot come by her; “in” heart you love</p>

<p>her, because your heart is in love with her; and</p>

<p>“out” of heart you love her, being out of heart that</p>

<p>you cannot enjoy her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  I am all these three.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  And three times as much more, <i>[aside]</i> and yet</p>

<p>nothing at all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Fetch hither the swain. He must carry me a</p>

<p>letter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  A message well sympathized–a horse to be ambassador</p>

<p>for an ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Ha? Ha? What sayest thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,</p>

<p>for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  The way is but short. Away!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  As swift as lead, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Thy meaning, pretty ingenious?</p>

<p>Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span></p>

<p>Minime, honest master, or rather, master, no.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span></p>

<p>I say lead is slow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  You are too swift, sir, to say so.</p>

<p>Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Sweet smoke of rhetoric!</p>

<p>He reputes me a cannon, and the bullet, that’s</p>

<p>he.–</p>

<p>I shoot thee at the swain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  Thump, then, and I flee.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span></p>

<p>A most acute juvenal, voluble and free of grace.</p>

<p>By thy favor, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face.</p>

<p>Most rude melancholy, valor gives thee place.</p>

<p>My herald is returned.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Boy and Clown Costard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  A wonder, master!</p>

<p>Here’s a costard broken in a shin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span></p>

<p>Some enigma, some riddle. Come, thy l’envoi begin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  No egma, no riddle, no l’envoi, no salve in</p>

<p>the mail, sir. O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! No</p>

<p>l’envoi, no l’envoi, no salve, sir, but a plantain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly</p>

<p>thought, my spleen. The heaving of my lungs</p>

<p>provokes me to ridiculous smiling. O pardon me,</p>

<p>my stars! Doth the inconsiderate take salve for</p>

<p>l’envoi, and the word l’envoi for a salve?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span></p>

<p>Do the wise think them other? Is not l’envoi a salve?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span></p>

<p>No, page, it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain</p>

<p>Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.</p>

<p>I will example it:</p>

<p>     <i>The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee</i></p>

<p>     <i>Were still at odds, being but three.</i></p>

<p>There’s the moral. Now the l’envoi.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  I will add the l’envoi. Say the moral again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span></p>

<p>     <i>The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee</i></p>

<p>     <i>Were still at odds, being but three.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span></p>

<p>     <i>Until the goose came out of door</i></p>

<p>     <i>And stayed the odds by adding four.</i></p>

<p>Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with</p>

<p>my l’envoi.</p>

<p>     <i>The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee</i></p>

<p>     <i>Were still at odds, being but three.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span></p>

<p>     <i>Until the goose came out of door,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Staying the odds by adding four.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  A good l’envoi, ending in the goose. Would you</p>

<p>desire more?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span></p>

<p>The boy hath sold him a bargain–a goose, that’s</p>

<p>flat.–</p>

<p>Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.</p>

<p>To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and</p>

<p>loose.</p>

<p>Let me see: a fat l’envoi–ay, that’s a fat goose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span></p>

<p>Come hither, come hither. How did this argument</p>

<p>begin?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span></p>

<p>By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.</p>

<p>Then called you for the l’envoi.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your</p>

<p>argument in. Then the boy’s fat l’envoi, the goose</p>

<p>that you bought; and he ended the market.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  But tell me, how was there a costard broken</p>

<p>in a shin?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  I will tell you sensibly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Thou hast no feeling of it, Mote. I will speak</p>

<p>that l’envoi.</p>

<p>     <i>I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  We will talk no more of this matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Till there be more matter in the shin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  O, marry me to one Frances! I smell some</p>

<p>l’envoi, some goose, in this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  By my sweet soul, I mean, setting thee at</p>

<p>liberty, enfreedoming thy person. Thou wert immured,</p>

<p>restrained, captivated, bound.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  True, true; and now you will be my purgation,</p>

<p>and let me loose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Armado</span>  I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance,</p>

<p>and, in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but</p>

<p>this: bear this significant to the country maid</p>

<p>Jaquenetta. <i>[(He gives him a paper.)]</i> There is remuneration</p>

<p><i>[(giving him a coin,)]</i> for the best ward of</p>

<p>mine honor is rewarding my dependents.–Mote,</p>

<p>follow.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span></p>

<p>My sweet ounce of man’s flesh, my incony Jew!</p>

<p>Now will I look to his remuneration. <i>[He looks at the</p>

<p>coin.]</i> “Remuneration”! O, that’s the Latin word for</p>

<p>three farthings. Three farthings–remuneration.</p>

<p>“What’s the price of this inkle?” “One penny.” “No,</p>

<p>I’ll give you a remuneration.” Why, it carries it!</p>

<p>Remuneration. Why, it is a fairer name than “French</p>

<p>crown.” I will never buy and sell out of this word.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Berowne.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  My good knave Costard, exceedingly well</p>

<p>met.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon</p>

<p>may a man buy for a remuneration?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  What is a remuneration?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Why then, three farthing worth of silk.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  I thank your Worship. God be wi’ you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He begins to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Stay, slave, I must employ thee.</p>

<p>As thou wilt win my favor, good my knave,</p>

<p>Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  When would you have it done, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  This afternoon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Well, I will do it, sir. Fare you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Thou knowest not what it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  I shall know, sir, when I have done it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  Why, villain, thou must know first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  I will come to your Worship tomorrow</p>

<p>morning.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span>  It must be done this afternoon. Hark, slave,</p>

<p>it is but this:</p>

<p>The Princess comes to hunt here in the park,</p>

<p>And in her train there is a gentle lady.</p>

<p>When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her</p>

<p>name,</p>

<p>And Rosaline they call her. Ask for her,</p>

<p>And to her white hand see thou do commend</p>

<p>This sealed-up counsel. There’s thy guerdon. <i>[He</p>

<p>gives him money.]</i> Go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Gardon. <i>[He looks at the money.]</i> O sweet</p>

<p>gardon! Better than remuneration, a ’levenpence</p>

<p>farthing better! Most sweet gardon. I will do it, sir,</p>

<p>in print. Gardon! Remuneration!     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Berowne</span></p>

<p>And I forsooth in love! I that have been love’s whip,</p>

<p>A very beadle to a humorous sigh,</p>

<p>A critic, nay, a nightwatch constable,</p>

<p>A domineering pedant o’er the boy,</p>

<p>Than whom no mortal so magnificent.</p>

<p>This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy,</p>

<p>This Signior Junior, giant dwarf, Dan Cupid,</p>

<p>Regent of love rhymes, lord of folded arms,</p>

<p>Th’ anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,</p>

<p>Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,</p>

<p>Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,</p>

<p>Sole imperator and great general</p>

<p>Of trotting paritors–O my little heart!</p>

<p>And I to be a corporal of his field</p>

<p>And wear his colors like a tumbler’s hoop!</p>

<p>What? I love, I sue, I seek a wife?</p>

<p>A woman, that is like a German clock,</p>

<p>Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,</p>

<p>And never going aright, being a watch,</p>

<p>But being watched that it may still go right.</p>

<p>Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all.</p>

<p>And, among three, to love the worst of all,</p>

<p>A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,</p>

<p>With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes.</p>

<p>Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed</p>

<p>Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard.</p>

<p>And I to sigh for her, to watch for her,</p>

<p>To pray for her! Go to. It is a plague</p>

<p>That Cupid will impose for my neglect</p>

<p>Of his almighty dreadful little might.</p>

<p>Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue, groan.</p>

<p>Some men must love my lady, and some Joan.</p>
