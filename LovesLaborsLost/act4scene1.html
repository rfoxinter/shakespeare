<p><center><i>[Enter the Princess, a Forester, her Ladies, Boyet and</p>

<p>her other Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Was that the King that spurred his horse so hard</p>

<p>Against the steep uprising of the hill?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Forester</span></p>

<p>I know not, but I think it was not he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Whoe’er he was, he showed a mounting mind.–</p>

<p>Well, lords, today we shall have our dispatch.</p>

<p>Or Saturday we will return to France.–</p>

<p>Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush</p>

<p>That we must stand and play the murderer in?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Forester</span></p>

<p>Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice,</p>

<p>A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,</p>

<p>And thereupon thou speakst “the fairest shoot.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Forester</span></p>

<p>Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>What, what? First praise me, and again say no?</p>

<p>O short-lived pride. Not fair? Alack, for woe!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Forester</span></p>

<p>Yes, madam, fair.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  Nay, never paint me now.</p>

<p>Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.</p>

<p>Here, good my glass, take this for telling true.</p>

<p><center><i>[She gives him money.]</i></center></p>

<p>Fair payment for foul words is more than due.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Forester</span></p>

<p>Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>See, see, my beauty will be saved by merit.</p>

<p>O heresy in fair, fit for these days!</p>

<p>A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.</p>

<p>But come, the bow. <i>[He hands her a bow.]</i> Now</p>

<p>mercy goes to kill,</p>

<p>And shooting well is then accounted ill.</p>

<p>Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:</p>

<p>Not wounding, pity would not let me do ’t;</p>

<p>If wounding, then it was to show my skill,</p>

<p>That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.</p>

<p>And out of question so it is sometimes:</p>

<p>Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,</p>

<p>When for fame’s sake, for praise, an outward part,</p>

<p>We bend to that the working of the heart;</p>

<p>As I for praise alone now seek to spill</p>

<p>The poor deer’s blood, that my heart means no ill.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>Do not curst wives hold that self sovereignty</p>

<p>Only for praise’ sake when they strive to be</p>

<p>Lords o’er their lords?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Only for praise; and praise we may afford</p>

<p>To any lady that subdues a lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Clown Costard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>Here comes a member of the commonwealth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the</p>

<p>head lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that</p>

<p>have no heads.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  Which is the greatest lady, the highest?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  The thickest and the tallest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span></p>

<p>The thickest and the tallest: it is so, truth is</p>

<p>truth.</p>

<p>An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,</p>

<p>One o’ these maids’ girdles for your waist should be</p>

<p>fit.</p>

<p>Are not you the chief woman? You are the thickest</p>

<p>here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  What’s your will, sir? What’s your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  I have a letter from Monsieur Berowne to</p>

<p>one Lady Rosaline.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>O, thy letter, thy letter! He’s a good friend of mine.</p>

<p>Stand aside, good bearer.–Boyet, you can carve.</p>

<p>Break up this capon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span> <i>[taking the letter]</i>  I am bound to serve.</p>

<p>This letter is mistook; it importeth none here.</p>

<p>It is writ to Jaquenetta.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  We will read it, I swear.</p>

<p>Break the neck of the wax, and everyone give ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span> <i>[reads.]</i>  By heaven, that thou art fair is most</p>

<p>infallible, true that thou art beauteous, truth itself</p>

<p>that thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful</p>

<p>than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have commiseration</p>

<p>on thy heroical vassal. The magnanimous and</p>

<p>most illustrate King Cophetua set eye upon the pernicious</p>

<p>and indubitate beggar Zenelophon; and he it</p>

<p>was that might rightly say “Veni, vidi, vici,” which to</p>

<p>annothanize in the vulgar (O base and obscure vulgar!)</p>

<p>videlicet, “He came, see, and overcame”: He</p>

<p>came, one; see, two; overcame, three. Who came? The</p>

<p>King. Why did he come? To see. Why did he see? To</p>

<p>overcome. To whom came he? To the beggar. What</p>

<p>saw he? The beggar. Who overcame he? The beggar.</p>

<p>The conclusion is victory. On whose side? The</p>

<p>King’s. The captive is enriched. On whose side? The</p>

<p>beggar’s. The catastrophe is a nuptial. On whose side?</p>

<p>The King’s–no, on both in one, or one in both. I am</p>

<p>the King, for so stands the comparison; thou the</p>

<p>beggar, for so witnesseth thy lowliness. Shall I command</p>

<p>thy love? I may. Shall I enforce thy love? I could.</p>

<p>Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou</p>

<p>exchange for rags? Robes. For tittles? Titles. For thyself?</p>

<p>Me. Thus expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy</p>

<p>foot, my eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every</p>

<p>part.</p>

<p>     <i>Thine, in the dearest design of industry,</i></p>

<p>Don Adriano de Armado.</p>

<p>     <i>Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar</i></p>

<p>        <i>’Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Submissive fall his princely feet before,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And he from forage will incline to play.</i></p>

<p>     <i>But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?</i></p>

<p>     <i>Food for his rage, repasture for his den.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?</p>

<p>What vane? What weathercock? Did you ever hear</p>

<p>better?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>I am much deceived but I remember the style.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Else your memory is bad, going o’er it erewhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>This Armado is a Spaniard that keeps here in court,</p>

<p>A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes</p>

<p>sport</p>

<p>To the Prince and his bookmates.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span> <i>[to Costard]</i>  Thou, fellow, a word.</p>

<p>Who gave thee this letter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  I told you: my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>To whom shouldst thou give it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span>  From my lord to my</p>

<p>lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span>  From which lord to which lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span></p>

<p>From my Lord Berowne, a good master of mine,</p>

<p>To a lady of France that he called Rosaline.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Princess</span></p>

<p>Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.</p>

<p><i>[To Rosaline.]</i> Here, sweet, put up this; ’twill be</p>

<p>thine another day.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Princess, Katherine, Lords, and</p>

<p>Forester exit. Boyet, Rosaline, Maria,</p>

<p>and Costard remain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>Who is the shooter? Who is the shooter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span>  Shall I</p>

<p>teach you to know?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>Ay, my continent of beauty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span>  Why, she that bears the bow.</p>

<p>Finely put off.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>My lady goes to kill horns, but if thou marry,</p>

<p>Hang me by the neck if horns that year miscarry.</p>

<p>Finely put on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>Well, then, I am the shooter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span>  And who is your deer?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span></p>

<p>If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.</p>

<p>Finely put on, indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span></p>

<p>You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at</p>

<p>the brow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>But she herself is hit lower. Have I hit her now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span>  Shall I come upon thee with an old saying,</p>

<p>that was a man when King Pippen of France was a</p>

<p>little boy, as touching the hit it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span>  So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a</p>

<p>woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little</p>

<p>wench, as touching the hit it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosaline</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Thou canst not hit it, my good man.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>An I cannot, cannot, cannot,</i></p>

<p>     <i>An I cannot, another can.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[Rosaline exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span></p>

<p>By my troth, most pleasant. How both did fit it!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span></p>

<p>A mark marvelous well shot, for they both did hit</p>

<p>it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>A mark! O, mark but that mark. “A mark,” says my</p>

<p>lady.</p>

<p>Let the mark have a prick in ’t to mete at, if it may</p>

<p>be.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span></p>

<p>Wide o’ the bow hand! I’ faith, your hand is out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span></p>

<p>Indeed, he must shoot nearer, or he’ll ne’er hit the</p>

<p>clout.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span> <i>[to Maria]</i></p>

<p>An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span></p>

<p>Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Maria</span></p>

<p>Come, come, you talk greasily. Your lips grow foul.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span> <i>[to Boyet]</i></p>

<p>She’s too hard for you at pricks, sir. Challenge her</p>

<p>to bowl.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boyet</span></p>

<p>I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.</p>

<p><center><i>[Boyet and Maria exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Costard</span></p>

<p>By my soul, a swain, a most simple clown.</p>

<p>Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him</p>

<p>down.</p>

<p>O’ my troth, most sweet jests, most incony vulgar</p>

<p>wit,</p>

<p>When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it</p>

<p>were, so fit.</p>

<p>Armado o’ th’ one side, O, a most dainty man!</p>

<p>To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan.</p>

<p>To see him kiss his hand, and how most sweetly he</p>

<p>will swear.</p>

<p>And his page o’ t’ other side, that handful of wit!</p>

<p>Ah heavens, it is a most pathetical nit.</p>

<p><center><i>[Shout within.]</i></center></p>
