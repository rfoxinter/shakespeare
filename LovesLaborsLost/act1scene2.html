<p><center><i>[Enter Armado and Mote, his page.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit</p>

<p>grows melancholy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Why, sadness is one and the selfsame thing,</p>

<p>dear imp.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  No, no. O Lord, sir, no!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  How canst thou part sadness and melancholy,</p>

<p>my tender juvenal?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  By a familiar demonstration of the working, my</p>

<p>tough signior.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Why “tough signior”? Why “tough signior”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Why “tender juvenal”? Why “tender juvenal”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I spoke it “tender juvenal” as a congruent</p>

<p>epitheton appertaining to thy young days, which</p>

<p>we may nominate “tender.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  And I “tough signior” as an appurtenant title to</p>

<p>your old time, which we may name “tough.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Pretty and apt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  How mean you, sir? I pretty and my saying apt, or</p>

<p>I apt and my saying pretty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Thou pretty because little.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  And therefore apt, because quick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Speak you this in my praise, master?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  In thy condign praise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  I will praise an eel with the same praise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  What, that an eel is ingenious?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  That an eel is quick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I do say thou art quick in answers. Thou</p>

<p>heat’st my blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  I am answered, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I love not to be crossed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love</p>

<p>not him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I have promised to study three years with the</p>

<p>Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  You may do it in an hour, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Impossible.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  How many is one thrice told?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I am ill at reckoning. It fitteth the spirit of a</p>

<p>tapster.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I confess both. They are both the varnish of a</p>

<p>complete man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Then I am sure you know how much the gross</p>

<p>sum of deuce-ace amounts to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  It doth amount to one more than two.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Which the base vulgar do call “three.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  True.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here is</p>

<p>“three” studied ere you’ll thrice wink. And how</p>

<p>easy it is to put “years” to the word “three” and</p>

<p>study “three years” in two words, the dancing horse</p>

<p>will tell you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  A most fine figure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  To prove you a cipher.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it</p>

<p>is base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a</p>

<p>base wench. If drawing my sword against the</p>

<p>humor of affection would deliver me from the</p>

<p>reprobate thought of it, I would take desire prisoner</p>

<p>and ransom him to any French courtier for a</p>

<p>new-devised curtsy. I think scorn to sigh; methinks</p>

<p>I should outswear Cupid. Comfort me, boy. What</p>

<p>great men have been in love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Hercules, master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear</p>

<p>boy, name more; and, sweet my child, let them be</p>

<p>men of good repute and carriage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Samson, master; he was a man of good carriage,</p>

<p>great carriage, for he carried the town gates on his</p>

<p>back like a porter, and he was in love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  O, well-knit Samson, strong-jointed Samson;</p>

<p>I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst</p>

<p>me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was</p>

<p>Samson’s love, my dear Mote?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  A woman, master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Of what complexion?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of</p>

<p>the four.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Tell me precisely of what complexion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Of the sea-water green, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Is that one of the four complexions?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  As I have read, sir, and the best of them too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Green indeed is the color of lovers. But to</p>

<p>have a love of that color, methinks Samson had</p>

<p>small reason for it. He surely affected her for her</p>

<p>wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  It was so, sir, for she had a green wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  My love is most immaculate white and red.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked</p>

<p>under such colors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Define, define, well-educated infant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  My father’s wit and my mother’s tongue, assist</p>

<p>me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Sweet invocation of a child, most pretty and</p>

<p>pathetical.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc></p>

<p>     <i>If she be made of white and red,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Her faults will ne’er be known,</i></p>

<p>     <i>For blushing cheeks by faults are bred,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And fears by pale white shown.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Then if she fear, or be to blame,</i></p>

<p>        <i>By this you shall not know,</i></p>

<p>     <i>For still her cheeks possess the same</i></p>

<p>        <i>Which native she doth owe.</i></p>

<p>A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of</p>

<p>white and red.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Is there not a ballad, boy, of “The King and</p>

<p>the Beggar”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  The world was very guilty of such a ballad some</p>

<p>three ages since, but I think now ’tis not to be found;</p>

<p>or if it were, it would neither serve for the writing</p>

<p>nor the tune.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I will have that subject newly writ o’er, that I</p>

<p>may example my digression by some mighty precedent.</p>

<p>Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in</p>

<p>the park with the rational hind Costard. She deserves</p>

<p>well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  To be whipped–and yet a better love than</p>

<p>my master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Sing, boy. My spirit grows heavy in love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  And that’s great marvel, loving a light</p>

<p>wench.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I say sing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Forbear till this company be past.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Clown (Costard,) Constable (Dull,) and Wench</p>

<p>(Jaquenetta.)]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dull</sc> <i>[to Armado]</i>  Sir, the Duke’s pleasure is that you</p>

<p>keep Costard safe, and you must suffer him to take</p>

<p>no delight, nor no penance, but he must fast three</p>

<p>days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at the</p>

<p>park. She is allowed for the dey-woman. Fare you</p>

<p>well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  I do betray myself with blushing.–</p>

<p>Maid.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaquenetta</sc>  Man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I will visit thee at the lodge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaquenetta</sc>  That’s hereby.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I know where it is situate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaquenetta</sc>  Lord, how wise you are.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I will tell thee wonders.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaquenetta</sc>  With that face?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I love thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaquenetta</sc>  So I heard you say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  And so, farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Jaquenetta</sc>  Fair weather after you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dull</sc>  Come, Jaquenetta, away.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dull and Jaquenetta exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc> <i>[to Costard]</i>  Villain, thou shalt fast for thy</p>

<p>offenses ere thou be pardoned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Costard</sc>  Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on</p>

<p>a full stomach.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  Thou shalt be heavily punished.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Costard</sc>  I am more bound to you than your fellows,</p>

<p>for they are but lightly rewarded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc> <i>[to Boy]</i>  Take away this villain. Shut him up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Come, you transgressing slave, away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Costard</sc> <i>[to Armado]</i>  Let me not be pent up, sir. I will</p>

<p>fast being loose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  No, sir, that were fast and loose. Thou shalt to</p>

<p>prison.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Costard</sc>  Well, if ever I do see the merry days of</p>

<p>desolation that I have seen, some shall see.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  What shall some see?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Costard</sc>  Nay, nothing, Master Mote, but what they</p>

<p>look upon. It is not for prisoners to be too silent in</p>

<p>their words, and therefore I will say nothing. I thank</p>

<p>God I have as little patience as another man, and</p>

<p>therefore I can be quiet.</p>

<p><center><i>[Costard and Boy exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Armado</sc>  I do affect the very ground (which is base)</p>

<p>where her shoe (which is baser) guided by her foot</p>

<p>(which is basest) doth tread. I shall be forsworn</p>

<p>(which is a great argument of falsehood) if I love.</p>

<p>And how can that be true love which is falsely</p>

<p>attempted? Love is a familiar; love is a devil. There is</p>

<p>no evil angel but love, yet was Samson so tempted,</p>

<p>and he had an excellent strength; yet was Solomon</p>

<p>so seduced, and he had a very good wit. Cupid’s</p>

<p>butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules’ club, and therefore</p>

<p>too much odds for a Spaniard’s rapier. The first</p>

<p>and second cause will not serve my turn; the</p>

<p>passado he respects not, the duello he regards not.</p>

<p>His disgrace is to be called “boy,” but his glory is to</p>

<p>subdue men. Adieu, valor; rust, rapier; be still,</p>

<p>drum, for your manager is in love. Yea, he loveth.</p>

<p>Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme, for I am</p>

<p>sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise wit, write pen, for I</p>

<p>am for whole volumes in folio.</p>
