<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>  The King, he is hunting the deer; I am</p>

<p>coursing myself. They have pitched a toil; I am</p>

<p>toiling in a pitch–pitch that defiles. Defile! A foul</p>

<p>word. Well, “set thee down, sorrow”; for so they</p>

<p>say the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool. Well</p>

<p>proved, wit. By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax.</p>

<p>It kills sheep, it kills me, I a sheep. Well proved</p>

<p>again, o’ my side. I will not love. If I do, hang me. I’</p>

<p>faith, I will not. O, but her eye! By this light, but for</p>

<p>her eye I would not love her; yes, for her two eyes.</p>

<p>Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and lie in my</p>

<p>throat. By heaven, I do love, and it hath taught me to</p>

<p>rhyme, and to be melancholy. And here is part of my</p>

<p>rhyme, and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one</p>

<p>o’ my sonnets already. The clown bore it, the fool</p>

<p>sent it, and the lady hath it. Sweet clown, sweeter</p>

<p>fool, sweetest lady. By the world, I would not care a</p>

<p>pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one with</p>

<p>a paper. God give him grace to groan.</p>

<p><center><i>[He stands aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[The King entereth with a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Ay me!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet</p>

<p>Cupid. Thou hast thumped him with thy birdbolt</p>

<p>under the left pap. In faith, secrets!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[reads]</i></p>

<p>     <i>So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not</i></p>

<p>        <i>To those fresh morning drops upon the rose</i></p>

<p>     <i>As thy eyebeams, when their fresh rays have smote</i></p>

<p>        <i>The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Nor shines the silver moon one-half so bright</i></p>

<p>        <i>Through the transparent bosom of the deep</i></p>

<p>     <i>As doth thy face, through tears of mine, give light.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Thou shin’st in every tear that I do weep.</i></p>

<p>     <i>No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;</i></p>

<p>        <i>So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Do but behold the tears that swell in me,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And they thy glory through my grief will show.</i></p>

<p>     <i>But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep</i></p>

<p>     <i>My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.</i></p>

<p>     <i>O queen of queens, how far dost thou excel</i></p>

<p>     <i>No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>How shall she know my griefs? I’ll drop the paper.</p>

<p>Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Longaville, with papers. The King steps aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What, Longaville, and reading! Listen, ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc>  Ay me! I am forsworn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>In love, I hope! Sweet fellowship in shame.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>One drunkard loves another of the name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc></p>

<p>Am I the first that have been perjured so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I could put thee in comfort: not by two that I know.</p>

<p>Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of</p>

<p>society,</p>

<p>The shape of love’s Tyburn, that hangs up simplicity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc></p>

<p>I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move.</p>

<p><i>[Reads.]</i> O sweet Maria, empress of my love–</p>

<p>These numbers will I tear and write in prose.</p>

<p><center><i>[He tears the paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid’s hose.</p>

<p>Disfigure not his shop!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc> <i>[taking another paper]</i>  This same shall go.</p>

<p><center><i>[He reads the sonnet.]</i></center></p>

<p>     <i>Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,</i></p>

<p>        <i>’Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Persuade my heart to this false perjury?</i></p>

<p>        <i>Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.</i></p>

<p>     <i>A woman I forswore, but I will prove,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee.</i></p>

<p>     <i>My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Thy grace being gained cures all disgrace in me.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Vows are but breath, and breath a vapor is.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Then thou, fair sun, which on my Earth dost</i></p>

<p>   <i>shine,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Exhal’st this vapor-vow; in thee it is.</i></p>

<p>        <i>If broken, then, it is no fault of mine.</i></p>

<p>     <i>If by me broke, what fool is not so wise</i></p>

<p>     <i>To lose an oath to win a paradise?</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>This is the liver vein, which makes flesh a deity,</p>

<p>A green goose a goddess. Pure, pure idolatry.</p>

<p>God amend us, God amend. We are much out o’ th’</p>

<p>way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc></p>

<p>By whom shall I send this?–Company? Stay.</p>

<p><center><i>[He steps aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dumaine, with a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>All hid, all hid–an old infant play.</p>

<p>Like a demigod here sit I in the sky,</p>

<p>And wretched fools’ secrets heedfully o’ereye.</p>

<p>More sacks to the mill. O heavens, I have my wish.</p>

<p>Dumaine transformed! Four woodcocks in a dish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc>  O most divine Kate!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  O most profane coxcomb!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>By Earth, she is not, corporal. There you lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>Her amber hairs for foul hath amber quoted.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>An amber-colored raven was well noted.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>As upright as the cedar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Stoop, I say.</p>

<p>Her shoulder is with child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc>  As fair as day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Ay, as some days, but then no sun must shine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>O, that I had my wish!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  And I had mine!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  And mine too, good Lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Amen, so I had mine. Is not that a good word?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>I would forget her, but a fever she</p>

<p>Reigns in my blood, and will remembered be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>A fever in your blood? Why, then incision</p>

<p>Would let her out in saucers! Sweet misprision.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>Once more I’ll read the ode that I have writ.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Once more I’ll mark how love can vary wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc> <i>[reads his sonnet.]</i></p>

<p>     <i>On a day–alack the day!–</i></p>

<p>     <i>Love, whose month is ever May,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Spied a blossom passing fair,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Playing in the wanton air.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Through the velvet leaves the wind,</i></p>

<p>     <i>All unseen, can passage find;</i></p>

<p>     <i>That the lover, sick to death,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Wished himself the heaven’s breath.</i></p>

<p>     <i>“Air,” quoth he, “thy cheeks may blow.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Air, would I might triumph so!”</i></p>

<p>     <i>But, alack, my hand is sworn</i></p>

<p>     <i>Ne’er to pluck thee from thy thorn.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Youth so apt to pluck a sweet.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Do not call it sin in me</i></p>

<p>     <i>That I am forsworn for thee–</i></p>

<p>     <i>Thou for whom Jove would swear</i></p>

<p>     <i>Juno but an Ethiope were,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And deny himself for Jove,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Turning mortal for thy love.</i></p>

<p>This will I send, and something else more plain</p>

<p>That shall express my true love’s fasting pain.</p>

<p>O, would the King, Berowne, and Longaville</p>

<p>Were lovers too! Ill to example ill</p>

<p>Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note,</p>

<p>For none offend where all alike do dote.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc> <i>[coming forward]</i></p>

<p>Dumaine, thy love is far from charity,</p>

<p>That in love’s grief desir’st society.</p>

<p>You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,</p>

<p>To be o’er-heard and taken napping so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[coming forward]</i></p>

<p><i>[To Longaville.]</i> Come, sir, you blush! As his, your</p>

<p>case is such.</p>

<p>You chide at him, offending twice as much.</p>

<p>You do not love Maria? Longaville</p>

<p>Did never sonnet for her sake compile,</p>

<p>Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart</p>

<p>His loving bosom to keep down his heart?</p>

<p>I have been closely shrouded in this bush</p>

<p>And marked you both, and for you both did blush.</p>

<p>I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,</p>

<p>Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion.</p>

<p>“Ay, me!” says one. “O Jove!” the other cries.</p>

<p>One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other’s eyes.</p>

<p><i>[To Longaville.]</i> You would for paradise break faith</p>

<p>and troth,</p>

<p><i>[To Dumaine.]</i> And Jove, for your love, would</p>

<p>infringe an oath.</p>

<p>What will Berowne say when that he shall hear</p>

<p>Faith infringed, which such zeal did swear?</p>

<p>How will he scorn, how will he spend his wit!</p>

<p>How will he triumph, leap, and laugh at it!</p>

<p>For all the wealth that ever I did see,</p>

<p>I would not have him know so much by me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc> <i>[coming forward]</i></p>

<p>Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Ah, good my liege, I pray thee pardon me.</p>

<p>Good heart, what grace hast thou thus to reprove</p>

<p>These worms for loving, that art most in love?</p>

<p>Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears</p>

<p>There is no certain princess that appears.</p>

<p>You’ll not be perjured, ’tis a hateful thing!</p>

<p>Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!</p>

<p>But are you not ashamed? Nay, are you not,</p>

<p>All three of you, to be thus much o’ershot?</p>

<p><i>[To Longaville.]</i> You found his mote, the King your</p>

<p>mote did see,</p>

<p>But I a beam do find in each of three.</p>

<p>O, what a scene of fool’ry have I seen,</p>

<p>Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow, and of teen!</p>

<p>O me, with what strict patience have I sat,</p>

<p>To see a king transformed to a gnat!</p>

<p>To see great Hercules whipping a gig,</p>

<p>And profound Solomon to tune a jig,</p>

<p>And Nestor play at pushpin with the boys,</p>

<p>And critic Timon laugh at idle toys.</p>

<p>Where lies thy grief, O tell me, good Dumaine?</p>

<p>And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?</p>

<p>And where my liege’s? All about the breast!</p>

<p>A caudle, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Too bitter is thy jest.</p>

<p>Are we betrayed thus to thy overview?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>Not you to me, but I betrayed by you.</p>

<p>I, that am honest, I, that hold it sin</p>

<p>To break the vow I am engaged in.</p>

<p>I am betrayed by keeping company</p>

<p>With men like you, men of inconstancy.</p>

<p>When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?</p>

<p>Or groan for Joan? or spend a minute’s time</p>

<p>In pruning me? When shall you hear that I</p>

<p>Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,</p>

<p>A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,</p>

<p>A leg, a limb–</p>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Soft, whither away so fast?</p>

<p>A true man, or a thief, that gallops so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p><sc>King</sc>  What present hast thou there?</p>

<p>Some certain treason.</p>

<p><sc>King</sc>  What makes treason here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Costard</sc></p>

<p>Nay, it makes nothing, sir.</p>

<p><sc>Jaquenetta</sc></p>

<p>I beseech your Grace, let this letter be read.</p>

<p>Our person misdoubts it. ’Twas treason, he said.</p>

<p>Berowne, read it over.</p>

<p><center><i>[Berowne reads the letter.]</i></center></p>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>A toy, my liege, a toy. Your Grace needs not fear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc></p>

<p>It did move him to passion, and therefore let’s hear</p>

<p>it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc> <i>[picking up the papers]</i></p>

<p>Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace.</p>

<p>   <i>As true we are as flesh and blood can be.</i></p>

<p>The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;</p>

<p>   <i>Young blood doth not obey an old decree.</i></p>

<p>We cannot cross the cause why we were born;</p>

<p>Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly</p>

<p>Rosaline</p>

<p>That, like a rude and savage man of Ind</p>

<p>   <i>At the first op’ning of the gorgeous East,</i></p>

<p>Bows not his vassal head and, strucken blind,</p>

<p>   <i>Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?</i></p>

<p>What peremptory eagle-sighted eye</p>

<p>   <i>Dares look upon the heaven of her brow</i></p>

<p>That is not blinded by her majesty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>   <i>What zeal, what fury, hath inspired thee now?</i></p>

<p>My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon,</p>

<p>   <i>She an attending star scarce seen a light.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Berowne.</p>

<p>   <i>O, but for my love, day would turn to night!</i></p>

<p>Of all complexions the culled sovereignty</p>

<p>   <i>Do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek.</i></p>

<p>Where several worthies make one dignity,</p>

<p>   <i>Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.</i></p>

<p>Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues–</p>

<p>   <i>Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not!</i></p>

<p>To things of sale a seller’s praise belongs.</p>

<p>   <i>She passes praise. Then praise too short doth blot.</i></p>

<p>A withered hermit, fivescore winters worn,</p>

<p>   <i>Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye.</i></p>

<p>Beauty doth varnish age, as if newborn,</p>

<p>   <i>And gives the crutch the cradle’s infancy.</i></p>

<p>O, ’tis the sun that maketh all things shine!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>   <i>By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>Is ebony like her? O word divine!</p>

<p>   <i>A wife of such wood were felicity.</i></p>

<p>O, who can give an oath? Where is a book,</p>

<p>   <i>That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack</i></p>

<p>If that she learn not of her eye to look?</p>

<p>   <i>No face is fair that is not full so black.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>O, paradox! Black is the badge of hell,</p>

<p>   <i>The hue of dungeons and the school of night,</i></p>

<p>And beauty’s crest becomes the heavens well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>   <i>Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.</i></p>

<p>O, if in black my lady’s brows be decked,</p>

<p>   <i>It mourns that painting and usurping hair</i></p>

<p>Should ravish doters with a false aspect:</p>

<p>   <i>And therefore is she born to make black fair.</i></p>

<p>Her favor turns the fashion of the days,</p>

<p>   <i>For native blood is counted painting now.</i></p>

<p>And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,</p>

<p>   <i>Paints itself black to imitate her brow.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc></p>

<p>   <i>And since her time are colliers counted bright.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>   <i>Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>Your mistresses dare never come in rain,</p>

<p>   <i>For fear their colors should be washed away.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>’Twere good yours did, for, sir, to tell you plain,</p>

<p>   <i>I’ll find a fairer face not washed today.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>I’ll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>   <i>No devil will fright thee then so much as she.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>   <i>Her feet were much too dainty for such tread.</i></p>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>O vile! Then as she goes, what upward lies</p>

<p>   <i>The street should see as she walked overhead.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>But what of this? Are we not all in love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>   <i>Nothing so sure, and thereby all forsworn.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Then leave this chat, and, good Berowne, now prove</p>

<p>   <i>Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>Ay, marry, there, some flattery for this evil.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc></p>

<p>   <i>O, some authority how to proceed,</i></p>

<p>Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dumaine</sc></p>

<p>   <i>Some salve for perjury.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc>     <i>O, ’tis more than need.</i></p>

<p>Have at you, then, affection’s men-at-arms!</p>

<p>O, we have made a vow to study, lords,</p>

<p>And in that vow we have forsworn our books.</p>

<p>For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,</p>

<p>In leaden contemplation have found out</p>

<p>Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes</p>

<p>Of beauty’s tutors have enriched you with?</p>

<p>Other slow arts entirely keep the brain</p>

<p>And therefore, finding barren practicers,</p>

<p>Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil.</p>

<p>But love, first learned in a lady’s eyes,</p>

<p>Lives not alone immured in the brain,</p>

<p>But with the motion of all elements</p>

<p>Courses as swift as thought in every power,</p>

<p>And gives to every power a double power,</p>

<p>Above their functions and their offices.</p>

<p>It adds a precious seeing to the eye.</p>

<p>A lover’s eyes will gaze an eagle blind.</p>

<p>A lover’s ear will hear the lowest sound,</p>

<p>When the suspicious head of theft is stopped.</p>

<p>Love’s feeling is more soft and sensible</p>

<p>Than are the tender horns of cockled snails.</p>

<p>Love’s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.</p>

<p>For valor, is not love a Hercules,</p>

<p>Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?</p>

<p>Subtle as Sphinx, as sweet and musical</p>

<p>As bright Apollo’s lute strung with his hair.</p>

<p>And when love speaks, the voice of all the gods</p>

<p>Make heaven drowsy with the harmony.</p>

<p>Never durst poet touch a pen to write</p>

<p>Until his ink were tempered with love’s sighs.</p>

<p>O, then his lines would ravish savage ears</p>

<p>And plant in tyrants mild humility.</p>

<p>From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive.</p>

<p>They sparkle still the right Promethean fire.</p>

<p>They are the books, the arts, the academes</p>

<p>That show, contain, and nourish all the world.</p>

<p>Else none at all in ought proves excellent.</p>

<p>Then fools you were these women to forswear,</p>

<p>Or, keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.</p>

<p>For wisdom’s sake, a word that all men love,</p>

<p>Or for love’s sake, a word that loves all men,</p>

<p>Or for men’s sake, the authors of these women,</p>

<p>Or women’s sake, by whom we men are men,</p>

<p>Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,</p>

<p>Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.</p>

<p>It is religion to be thus forsworn,</p>

<p>For charity itself fulfills the law,</p>

<p>And who can sever love from charity?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Saint Cupid, then, and, soldiers, to the field!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>Advance your standards, and upon them, lords.</p>

<p>Pell-mell, down with them. But be first advised</p>

<p>In conflict that you get the sun of them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Longaville</sc></p>

<p>Now to plain dealing. Lay these glozes by.</p>

<p>Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>And win them, too. Therefore let us devise</p>

<p>Some entertainment for them in their tents.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>First, from the park let us conduct them thither.</p>

<p>Then homeward every man attach the hand</p>

<p>Of his fair mistress. In the afternoon</p>

<p>We will with some strange pastime solace them,</p>

<p>Such as the shortness of the time can shape;</p>

<p>For revels, dances, masques, and merry hours</p>

<p>Forerun fair love, strewing her way with flowers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Away, away! No time shall be omitted</p>

<p>That will betime and may by us be fitted.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Berowne</sc></p>

<p>Allons! Allons! Sowed cockle reaped no corn,</p>

<p>   <i>And justice always whirls in equal measure.</i></p>

<p>Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;</p>

<p>   <i>If so, our copper buys no better treasure.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
