<p><center><i>[Enter Provost and a Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span></p>

<p>He’s hearing of a cause. He will come straight.</p>

<p>I’ll tell him of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span>  Pray you do.</p>

<p><center><i>[Servant exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>I’ll know</p>

<p>His pleasure. Maybe he will relent. Alas,</p>

<p>He hath but as offended in a dream.</p>

<p>All sects, all ages smack of this vice, and he</p>

<p>To die for ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Angelo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Now, what’s the matter, provost?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span></p>

<p>Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?</p>

<p>Why dost thou ask again?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span>  Lest I might be too rash.</p>

<p>Under your good correction, I have seen</p>

<p>When, after execution, judgment hath</p>

<p>Repented o’er his doom.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Go to. Let that be mine.</p>

<p>Do you your office, or give up your place</p>

<p>And you shall well be spared.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span>  I crave your Honor’s pardon.</p>

<p>What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?</p>

<p>She’s very near her hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Dispose of her</p>

<p>To some more fitter place, and that with speed.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span></p>

<p>Here is the sister of the man condemned</p>

<p>Desires access to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Hath he a sister?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord, a very virtuous maid,</p>

<p>And to be shortly of a sisterhood,</p>

<p>If not already.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span> <i>[to Servant]</i>  Well, let her be admitted.</p>

<p><center><i>[Servant exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>See you the fornicatress be removed.</p>

<p>Let her have needful but not lavish means.</p>

<p>There shall be order for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucio and Isabella.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span> <i>[beginning to exit]</i>  Save your Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Stay a little while. <i>[To Isabella.]</i> You’re welcome.</p>

<p>What’s your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>I am a woeful suitor to your Honor,</p>

<p>Please but your Honor hear me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Well, what’s your</p>

<p>suit?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>There is a vice that most I do abhor,</p>

<p>And most desire should meet the blow of justice,</p>

<p>For which I would not plead, but that I must;</p>

<p>For which I must not plead, but that I am</p>

<p>At war ’twixt will and will not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Well, the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>I have a brother is condemned to die.</p>

<p>I do beseech you let it be his fault</p>

<p>And not my brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Heaven give thee moving</p>

<p>graces.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Condemn the fault, and not the actor of it?</p>

<p>Why, every fault’s condemned ere it be done.</p>

<p>Mine were the very cipher of a function</p>

<p>To fine the faults whose fine stands in record</p>

<p>And let go by the actor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  O just but severe law!</p>

<p>I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span> <i>[aside to Isabella]</i></p>

<p>Give ’t not o’er so. To him again, entreat him,</p>

<p>Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown.</p>

<p>You are too cold. If you should need a pin,</p>

<p>You could not with more tame a tongue desire it.</p>

<p>To him, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span> <i>[to Angelo]</i></p>

<p>Must he needs die?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Maiden, no remedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Yes, I do think that you might pardon him,</p>

<p>And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>I will not do ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  But can you if you would?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Look what I will not, that I cannot do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>But might you do ’t and do the world no wrong</p>

<p>If so your heart were touched with that remorse</p>

<p>As mine is to him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  He’s sentenced. ’Tis too late.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span> <i>[aside to Isabella]</i>  You are too cold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Too late? Why, no. I that do speak a word</p>

<p>May call it back again. Well believe this:</p>

<p>No ceremony that to great ones longs,</p>

<p>Not the king’s crown, nor the deputed sword,</p>

<p>The marshal’s truncheon, nor the judge’s robe</p>

<p>Become them with one half so good a grace</p>

<p>As mercy does.</p>

<p>If he had been as you, and you as he,</p>

<p>You would have slipped like him, but he like you</p>

<p>Would not have been so stern.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Pray you begone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>I would to heaven I had your potency,</p>

<p>And you were Isabel. Should it then be thus?</p>

<p>No. I would tell what ’twere to be a judge</p>

<p>And what a prisoner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span> <i>[aside to Isabella]</i>  Ay, touch him; there’s the</p>

<p>vein.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Your brother is a forfeit of the law,</p>

<p>And you but waste your words.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Alas, alas!</p>

<p>Why all the souls that were were forfeit once,</p>

<p>And He that might the vantage best have took</p>

<p>Found out the remedy. How would you be</p>

<p>If He which is the top of judgment should</p>

<p>But judge you as you are? O, think on that,</p>

<p>And mercy then will breathe within your lips</p>

<p>Like man new-made.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Be you content, fair maid.</p>

<p>It is the law, not I, condemn your brother.</p>

<p>Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,</p>

<p>It should be thus with him. He must die tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Tomorrow? O, that’s sudden! Spare him, spare him.</p>

<p>He’s not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens</p>

<p>We kill the fowl of season. Shall we serve heaven</p>

<p>With less respect than we do minister</p>

<p>To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink</p>

<p>you.</p>

<p>Who is it that hath died for this offense?</p>

<p>There’s many have committed it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span> <i>[aside to Isabella]</i>  Ay, well said.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.</p>

<p>Those many had not dared to do that evil</p>

<p>If the first that did th’ edict infringe</p>

<p>Had answered for his deed. Now ’tis awake,</p>

<p>Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,</p>

<p>Looks in a glass that shows what future evils–</p>

<p>Either now, or by remissness new-conceived,</p>

<p>And so in progress to be hatched and born–</p>

<p>Are now to have no successive degrees</p>

<p>But, ere they live, to end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Yet show some pity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>I show it most of all when I show justice,</p>

<p>For then I pity those I do not know,</p>

<p>Which a dismissed offense would after gall,</p>

<p>And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,</p>

<p>Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;</p>

<p>Your brother dies tomorrow; be content.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>So you must be the first that gives this sentence,</p>

<p>And he that suffers. O, it is excellent</p>

<p>To have a giant’s strength, but it is tyrannous</p>

<p>To use it like a giant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span> <i>[aside to Isabella]</i>  That’s well said.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Could great men thunder</p>

<p>As Jove himself does, Jove would never be quiet,</p>

<p>For every pelting, petty officer</p>

<p>Would use his heaven for thunder,</p>

<p>Nothing but thunder. Merciful heaven,</p>

<p>Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt</p>

<p>Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak,</p>

<p>Than the soft myrtle. But man, proud man,</p>

<p>Dressed in a little brief authority,</p>

<p>Most ignorant of what he’s most assured,</p>

<p>His glassy essence, like an angry ape</p>

<p>Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven</p>

<p>As makes the angels weep, who with our spleens</p>

<p>Would all themselves laugh mortal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span> <i>[aside to Isabella]</i></p>

<p>O, to him, to him, wench. He will relent.</p>

<p>He’s coming. I perceive ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Pray heaven she win him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.</p>

<p>Great men may jest with saints; ’tis wit in them,</p>

<p>But in the less, foul profanation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span> <i>[aside to Isabella]</i></p>

<p>Thou ’rt i’ th’ right, girl. More o’ that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>That in the captain’s but a choleric word</p>

<p>Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span> <i>[aside to Isabella]</i></p>

<p>Art avised o’ that? More on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Why do you put these sayings upon me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Because authority, though it err like others,</p>

<p>Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself</p>

<p>That skins the vice o’ th’ top. Go to your bosom,</p>

<p>Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know</p>

<p>That’s like my brother’s fault. If it confess</p>

<p>A natural guiltiness such as is his,</p>

<p>Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue</p>

<p>Against my brother’s life.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span> <i>[aside]</i>  She speaks, and ’tis such sense</p>

<p>That my sense breeds with it.     <i><i>[He begins to exit.]</i></i></p>

<p>Fare you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Gentle my lord, turn back.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>I will bethink me. Come again tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Hark how I’ll bribe you. Good my lord, turn back.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  How? Bribe me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span> <i>[aside to Isabella]</i>  You had marred all else.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,</p>

<p>Or stones whose rate are either rich or poor</p>

<p>As fancy values them, but with true prayers</p>

<p>That shall be up at heaven and enter there</p>

<p>Ere sunrise, prayers from preserved souls,</p>

<p>From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate</p>

<p>To nothing temporal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Well, come to me tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span> <i>[aside to Isabella]</i>  Go to, ’tis well; away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Heaven keep your Honor safe.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Amen.</p>

<p>For I am that way going to temptation</p>

<p>Where prayers cross.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  At what hour tomorrow</p>

<p>Shall I attend your Lordship?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  At any time ’fore noon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Save your Honor.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits, with Lucio and Provost.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  From thee, even from thy virtue.</p>

<p>What’s this? What’s this? Is this her fault or mine?</p>

<p>The tempter or the tempted, who sins most, ha?</p>

<p>Not she, nor doth she tempt; but it is I</p>

<p>That, lying by the violet in the sun,</p>

<p>Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,</p>

<p>Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be</p>

<p>That modesty may more betray our sense</p>

<p>Than woman’s lightness? Having waste ground</p>

<p>enough,</p>

<p>Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary</p>

<p>And pitch our evils there? O fie, fie, fie!</p>

<p>What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?</p>

<p>Dost thou desire her foully for those things</p>

<p>That make her good? O, let her brother live.</p>

<p>Thieves for their robbery have authority</p>

<p>When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her</p>

<p>That I desire to hear her speak again</p>

<p>And feast upon her eyes? What is ’t I dream on?</p>

<p>O cunning enemy that, to catch a saint,</p>

<p>With saints dost bait thy hook. Most dangerous</p>

<p>Is that temptation that doth goad us on</p>

<p>To sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet</p>

<p>With all her double vigor, art and nature,</p>

<p>Once stir my temper, but this virtuous maid</p>

<p>Subdues me quite. Ever till now</p>

<p>When men were fond, I smiled and wondered how.</p>
