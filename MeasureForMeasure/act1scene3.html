<p><center><i>[Enter Duke and Friar Thomas.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>No, holy father, throw away that thought.</p>

<p>Believe not that the dribbling dart of love</p>

<p>Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee</p>

<p>To give me secret harbor hath a purpose</p>

<p>More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends</p>

<p>Of burning youth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Thomas</sc>  May your Grace speak of it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>My holy sir, none better knows than you</p>

<p>How I have ever loved the life removed,</p>

<p>And held in idle price to haunt assemblies</p>

<p>Where youth and cost witless bravery keeps.</p>

<p>I have delivered to Lord Angelo,</p>

<p>A man of stricture and firm abstinence,</p>

<p>My absolute power and place here in Vienna,</p>

<p>And he supposes me traveled to Poland,</p>

<p>For so I have strewed it in the common ear,</p>

<p>And so it is received. Now, pious sir,</p>

<p>You will demand of me why I do this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Thomas</sc>  Gladly, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>We have strict statutes and most biting laws,</p>

<p>The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,</p>

<p>Which for this fourteen years we have let slip,</p>

<p>Even like an o’ergrown lion in a cave</p>

<p>That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,</p>

<p>Having bound up the threat’ning twigs of birch</p>

<p>Only to stick it in their children’s sight</p>

<p>For terror, not to use–in time the rod</p>

<p>More mocked than feared–so our decrees,</p>

<p>Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead,</p>

<p>And liberty plucks justice by the nose,</p>

<p>The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart</p>

<p>Goes all decorum.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Thomas</sc>  It rested in your Grace</p>

<p>To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased,</p>

<p>And it in you more dreadful would have seemed</p>

<p>Than in Lord Angelo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  I do fear, too dreadful.</p>

<p>Sith ’twas my fault to give the people scope,</p>

<p>’Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them</p>

<p>For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done</p>

<p>When evil deeds have their permissive pass</p>

<p>And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my</p>

<p>father,</p>

<p>I have on Angelo imposed the office,</p>

<p>Who may in th’ ambush of my name strike home,</p>

<p>And yet my nature never in the fight</p>

<p>To do in slander. And to behold his sway</p>

<p>I will, as ’twere a brother of your order,</p>

<p>Visit both prince and people. Therefore I prithee</p>

<p>Supply me with the habit, and instruct me</p>

<p>How I may formally in person bear</p>

<p>Like a true friar. More reasons for this action</p>

<p>At our more leisure shall I render you.</p>

<p>Only this one: Lord Angelo is precise,</p>

<p>Stands at a guard with envy, scarce confesses</p>

<p>That his blood flows or that his appetite</p>

<p>Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,</p>

<p>If power change purpose, what our seemers be.</p>
