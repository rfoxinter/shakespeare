<p><center><i>[Enter Duke, Escalus, Lords, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span>  Escalus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Escalus</span>  My lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Of government the properties to unfold</p>

<p>Would seem in me t’ affect speech and discourse,</p>

<p>Since I am put to know that your own science</p>

<p>Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice</p>

<p>My strength can give you. Then no more remains</p>

<p>But that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,</p>

<p>And let them work. The nature of our people,</p>

<p>Our city’s institutions, and the terms</p>

<p>For common justice, you’re as pregnant in</p>

<p>As art and practice hath enriched any</p>

<p>That we remember. There is our commission,</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands Escalus a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>From which we would not have you warp.–Call</p>

<p>hither,</p>

<p>I say, bid come before us Angelo.</p>

<p><center><i>[An Attendant exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>What figure of us think you he will bear?</p>

<p>For you must know, we have with special soul</p>

<p>Elected him our absence to supply,</p>

<p>Lent him our terror, dressed him with our love,</p>

<p>And given his deputation all the organs</p>

<p>Of our own power. What think you of it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Escalus</span></p>

<p>If any in Vienna be of worth</p>

<p>To undergo such ample grace and honor,</p>

<p>It is Lord Angelo.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Angelo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span>  Look where he comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Always obedient to your Grace’s will,</p>

<p>I come to know your pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span>  Angelo,</p>

<p>There is a kind of character in thy life</p>

<p>That to th’ observer doth thy history</p>

<p>Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings</p>

<p>Are not thine own so proper as to waste</p>

<p>Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.</p>

<p>Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,</p>

<p>Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues</p>

<p>Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike</p>

<p>As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touched</p>

<p>But to fine issues, nor nature never lends</p>

<p>The smallest scruple of her excellence</p>

<p>But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines</p>

<p>Herself the glory of a creditor,</p>

<p>Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech</p>

<p>To one that can my part in him advertise.</p>

<p>Hold, therefore, Angelo.</p>

<p>In our remove be thou at full ourself.</p>

<p>Mortality and mercy in Vienna</p>

<p>Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,</p>

<p>Though first in question, is thy secondary.</p>

<p>Take thy commission.     <i><i>[He hands Angelo a paper.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Now, good my lord,</p>

<p>Let there be some more test made of my mettle</p>

<p>Before so noble and so great a figure</p>

<p>Be stamped upon it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span>  No more evasion.</p>

<p>We have with a leavened and prepared choice</p>

<p>Proceeded to you. Therefore, take your honors.</p>

<p>Our haste from hence is of so quick condition</p>

<p>That it prefers itself and leaves unquestioned</p>

<p>Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,</p>

<p>As time and our concernings shall importune,</p>

<p>How it goes with us, and do look to know</p>

<p>What doth befall you here. So fare you well.</p>

<p>To th’ hopeful execution do I leave you</p>

<p>Of your commissions.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Yet give leave, my lord,</p>

<p>That we may bring you something on the way.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span>  My haste may not admit it.</p>

<p>Nor need you, on mine honor, have to do</p>

<p>With any scruple. Your scope is as mine own,</p>

<p>So to enforce or qualify the laws</p>

<p>As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand.</p>

<p>I’ll privily away. I love the people,</p>

<p>But do not like to stage me to their eyes.</p>

<p>Though it do well, I do not relish well</p>

<p>Their loud applause and aves vehement,</p>

<p>Nor do I think the man of safe discretion</p>

<p>That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>The heavens give safety to your purposes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Escalus</span></p>

<p>Lead forth and bring you back in happiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span>  I thank you. Fare you well.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Escalus</span> <i>[to Angelo]</i></p>

<p>I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave</p>

<p>To have free speech with you; and it concerns me</p>

<p>To look into the bottom of my place.</p>

<p>A power I have, but of what strength and nature</p>

<p>I am not yet instructed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>’Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,</p>

<p>And we may soon our satisfaction have</p>

<p>Touching that point.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Escalus</span>  I’ll wait upon your Honor.</p>
