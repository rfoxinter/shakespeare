<p><center><i>[Enter Angelo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>When I would pray and think, I think and pray</p>

<p>To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,</p>

<p>Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,</p>

<p>Anchors on Isabel. God in my mouth,</p>

<p>As if I did but only chew His name,</p>

<p>And in my heart the strong and swelling evil</p>

<p>Of my conception. The state whereon I studied</p>

<p>Is, like a good thing being often read,</p>

<p>Grown sere and tedious. Yea, my gravity,</p>

<p>Wherein–let no man hear me–I take pride,</p>

<p>Could I with boot change for an idle plume</p>

<p>Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,</p>

<p>How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,</p>

<p>Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls</p>

<p>To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.</p>

<p>Let’s write “good angel” on the devil’s horn.</p>

<p>’Tis not the devil’s crest. <i>[Knock within.]</i> How now,</p>

<p>who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Servant</span></p>

<p>One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Teach her the way. <i>[Servant exits.]</i> O heavens,</p>

<p>Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,</p>

<p>Making both it unable for itself</p>

<p>And dispossessing all my other parts</p>

<p>Of necessary fitness?</p>

<p>So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons,</p>

<p>Come all to help him, and so stop the air</p>

<p>By which he should revive. And even so</p>

<p>The general subject to a well-wished king</p>

<p>Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness</p>

<p>Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love</p>

<p>Must needs appear offense.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Isabella.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, fair maid?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  I am come to know your pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>That you might know it would much better please me</p>

<p>Than to demand what ’tis. Your brother cannot live.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Even so. Heaven keep your Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Yet may he live a while. And it may be</p>

<p>As long as you or I. Yet he must die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Under your sentence?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Yea.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>When, I beseech you? That in his reprieve,</p>

<p>Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted</p>

<p>That his soul sicken not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good</p>

<p>To pardon him that hath from nature stolen</p>

<p>A man already made, as to remit</p>

<p>Their saucy sweetness that do coin God’s image</p>

<p>In stamps that are forbid. ’Tis all as easy</p>

<p>Falsely to take away a life true made</p>

<p>As to put metal in restrained means</p>

<p>To make a false one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>’Tis set down so in heaven, but not in Earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly:</p>

<p>Which had you rather, that the most just law</p>

<p>Now took your brother’s life, or, to redeem him,</p>

<p>Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness</p>

<p>As she that he hath stained?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Sir, believe this:</p>

<p>I had rather give my body than my soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>I talk not of your soul. Our compelled sins</p>

<p>Stand more for number than for accompt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  How say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Nay, I’ll not warrant that, for I can speak</p>

<p>Against the thing I say. Answer to this:</p>

<p>I, now the voice of the recorded law,</p>

<p>Pronounce a sentence on your brother’s life.</p>

<p>Might there not be a charity in sin</p>

<p>To save this brother’s life?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Please you to do ’t,</p>

<p>I’ll take it as a peril to my soul,</p>

<p>It is no sin at all, but charity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Pleased you to do ’t, at peril of your soul,</p>

<p>Were equal poise of sin and charity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>That I do beg his life, if it be sin</p>

<p>Heaven let me bear it. You granting of my suit,</p>

<p>If that be sin, I’ll make it my morn prayer</p>

<p>To have it added to the faults of mine</p>

<p>And nothing of your answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Nay, but hear me.</p>

<p>Your sense pursues not mine. Either you are</p>

<p>ignorant,</p>

<p>Or seem so, crafty, and that’s not good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Let me be ignorant and in nothing good,</p>

<p>But graciously to know I am no better.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright</p>

<p>When it doth tax itself, as these black masks</p>

<p>Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder</p>

<p>Than beauty could, displayed. But mark me.</p>

<p>To be received plain, I’ll speak more gross:</p>

<p>Your brother is to die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  So.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>And his offense is so, as it appears,</p>

<p>Accountant to the law upon that pain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  True.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Admit no other way to save his life–</p>

<p>As I subscribe not that, nor any other–</p>

<p>But, in the loss of question, that you, his sister,</p>

<p>Finding yourself desired of such a person</p>

<p>Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,</p>

<p>Could fetch your brother from the manacles</p>

<p>Of the all-binding law, and that there were</p>

<p>No earthly mean to save him but that either</p>

<p>You must lay down the treasures of your body</p>

<p>To this supposed, or else to let him suffer,</p>

<p>What would you do?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>As much for my poor brother as myself.</p>

<p>That is, were I under the terms of death,</p>

<p>Th’ impression of keen whips I’d wear as rubies</p>

<p>And strip myself to death as to a bed</p>

<p>That longing have been sick for, ere I’d yield</p>

<p>My body up to shame.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Then must your brother die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  And ’twere the cheaper way.</p>

<p>Better it were a brother died at once</p>

<p>Than that a sister, by redeeming him,</p>

<p>Should die forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>Were not you then as cruel as the sentence</p>

<p>That you have slandered so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Ignomy in ransom and free pardon</p>

<p>Are of two houses. Lawful mercy</p>

<p>Is nothing kin to foul redemption.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>You seemed of late to make the law a tyrant,</p>

<p>And rather proved the sliding of your brother</p>

<p>A merriment than a vice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>O, pardon me, my lord. It oft falls out,</p>

<p>To have what we would have, we speak not what we</p>

<p>mean.</p>

<p>I something do excuse the thing I hate</p>

<p>For his advantage that I dearly love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>We are all frail.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Else let my brother die,</p>

<p>If not a fedary but only he</p>

<p>Owe and succeed thy weakness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Nay, women are frail too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,</p>

<p>Which are as easy broke as they make forms.</p>

<p>Women–help, heaven–men their creation mar</p>

<p>In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail,</p>

<p>For we are soft as our complexions are,</p>

<p>And credulous to false prints.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  I think it well.</p>

<p>And from this testimony of your own sex,</p>

<p>Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger</p>

<p>Than faults may shake our frames, let me be bold.</p>

<p>I do arrest your words. Be that you are–</p>

<p>That is, a woman. If you be more, you’re none.</p>

<p>If you be one, as you are well expressed</p>

<p>By all external warrants, show it now</p>

<p>By putting on the destined livery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>I have no tongue but one. Gentle my lord,</p>

<p>Let me entreat you speak the former language.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Plainly conceive I love you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  My brother did love Juliet,</p>

<p>And you tell me that he shall die for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span></p>

<p>He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>I know your virtue hath a license in ’t</p>

<p>Which seems a little fouler than it is</p>

<p>To pluck on others.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Believe me, on mine honor,</p>

<p>My words express my purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Ha! Little honor to be much believed,</p>

<p>And most pernicious purpose. Seeming, seeming!</p>

<p>I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for ’t.</p>

<p>Sign me a present pardon for my brother</p>

<p>Or with an outstretched throat I’ll tell the world</p>

<p>aloud</p>

<p>What man thou art.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Angelo</span>  Who will believe thee, Isabel?</p>

<p>My unsoiled name, th’ austereness of my life,</p>

<p>My vouch against you, and my place i’ th’ state</p>

<p>Will so your accusation overweigh</p>

<p>That you shall stifle in your own report</p>

<p>And smell of calumny. I have begun,</p>

<p>And now I give my sensual race the rein.</p>

<p>Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;</p>

<p>Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes</p>

<p>That banish what they sue for. Redeem thy brother</p>

<p>By yielding up thy body to my will,</p>

<p>Or else he must not only die the death,</p>

<p>But thy unkindness shall his death draw out</p>

<p>To ling’ring sufferance. Answer me tomorrow,</p>

<p>Or by the affection that now guides me most,</p>

<p>I’ll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,</p>

<p>Say what you can, my false o’erweighs your true.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,</p>

<p>Who would believe me? O, perilous mouths,</p>

<p>That bear in them one and the selfsame tongue,</p>

<p>Either of condemnation or approof,</p>

<p>Bidding the law make curtsy to their will,</p>

<p>Hooking both right and wrong to th’ appetite,</p>

<p>To follow as it draws. I’ll to my brother.</p>

<p>Though he hath fall’n by prompture of the blood,</p>

<p>Yet hath he in him such a mind of honor</p>

<p>That, had he twenty heads to tender down</p>

<p>On twenty bloody blocks, he’d yield them up</p>

<p>Before his sister should her body stoop</p>

<p>To such abhorred pollution.</p>

<p>Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die.</p>

<p>More than our brother is our chastity.</p>

<p>I’ll tell him yet of Angelo’s request,</p>

<p>And fit his mind to death, for his soul’s rest.</p>
