<p><center><i>[Enter Provost, Pompey, and Officer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man’s</p>

<p>head?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be</p>

<p>a married man, he’s his wife’s head, and I can never</p>

<p>cut off a woman’s head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield</p>

<p>me a direct answer. Tomorrow morning are to die</p>

<p>Claudio and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a</p>

<p>common executioner, who in his office lacks a</p>

<p>helper. If you will take it on you to assist him, it</p>

<p>shall redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall</p>

<p>have your full time of imprisonment and your</p>

<p>deliverance with an unpitied whipping, for you have</p>

<p>been a notorious bawd.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of</p>

<p>mind, but yet I will be content to be a lawful</p>

<p>hangman. I would be glad to receive some instruction</p>

<p>from my fellow partner.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  What ho, Abhorson!–Where’s Abhorson</p>

<p>there?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Abhorson.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abhorson</sc>  Do you call, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Sirrah, here’s a fellow will help you tomorrow</p>

<p>in your execution. If you think it meet, compound</p>

<p>with him by the year and let him abide here</p>

<p>with you; if not, use him for the present and dismiss</p>

<p>him. He cannot plead his estimation with you; he</p>

<p>hath been a bawd.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abhorson</sc>  A bawd, sir? Fie upon him! He will discredit</p>

<p>our mystery.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Go to, sir; you weigh equally. A feather will</p>

<p>turn the scale.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Pray, sir, by your good favor–for surely, sir, a</p>

<p>good favor you have, but that you have a hanging</p>

<p>look–do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abhorson</sc>  Ay, sir, a mystery.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery;</p>

<p>and your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,</p>

<p>using painting, do prove my occupation a</p>

<p>mystery; but what mystery there should be in hanging,</p>

<p>if I should be hanged, I cannot imagine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abhorson</sc>  Sir, it is a mystery.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Proof?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abhorson</sc>  Every true man’s apparel fits your thief. If it</p>

<p>be too little for your thief, your true man thinks it</p>

<p>big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your thief</p>

<p>thinks it little enough. So every true man’s apparel</p>

<p>fits your thief.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Provost.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Are you agreed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Sir, I will serve him, for I do find your hangman</p>

<p>is a more penitent trade than your bawd. He</p>

<p>doth oftener ask forgiveness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc> <i>[to Abhorson]</i>  You, sirrah, provide your block</p>

<p>and your axe tomorrow, four o’clock.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Abhorson</sc> <i>[to Pompey]</i>  Come on, bawd. I will instruct</p>

<p>thee in my trade. Follow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  I do desire to learn, sir; and I hope, if you have</p>

<p>occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find</p>

<p>me yare. For truly, sir, for your kindness, I owe</p>

<p>you a good turn.     <i><i>[Pompey and Abhorson exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc> <i>[to Officer]</i></p>

<p>Call hither Barnardine and Claudio.</p>

<p><center><i>[Officer exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Th’ one has my pity; not a jot the other,</p>

<p>Being a murderer, though he were my brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Claudio, with Officer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look, here’s the warrant, Claudio, for thy death.</p>

<p>’Tis now dead midnight, and by eight tomorrow</p>

<p>Thou must be made immortal. Where’s Barnardine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>As fast locked up in sleep as guiltless labor</p>

<p>When it lies starkly in the traveler’s bones.</p>

<p>He will not wake.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Who can do good on him?</p>

<p>Well, go, prepare yourself. <i>[Knock within.]</i> But hark,</p>

<p>what noise?–</p>

<p>Heaven give your spirits comfort. <i>[Claudio exits,</p>

<p>with Officer.]</i> <i>[Knock within.]</i> By and by!–</p>

<p>I hope it is some pardon or reprieve</p>

<p>For the most gentle Claudio.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Duke, as a Friar.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Welcome, father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>The best and wholesom’st spirits of the night</p>

<p>Envelop you, good provost. Who called here of late?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc></p>

<p>None since the curfew rung.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Not Isabel?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  They will, then, ere ’t be long.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  What comfort is for Claudio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>There’s some in hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  It is a bitter deputy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Not so, not so. His life is paralleled</p>

<p>Even with the stroke and line of his great justice.</p>

<p>He doth with holy abstinence subdue</p>

<p>That in himself which he spurs on his power</p>

<p>To qualify in others. Were he mealed with that</p>

<p>Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous,</p>

<p>But this being so, he’s just. <i>[Knock within.]</i> Now are</p>

<p>they come.     <i><i>[Provost exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>This is a gentle provost. Seldom when</p>

<p>The steeled jailer is the friend of men.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Provost. Knocking continues.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, what noise? That spirit’s possessed with</p>

<p>haste</p>

<p>That wounds th’ unsisting postern with these strokes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc></p>

<p>There he must stay until the officer</p>

<p>Arise to let him in. He is called up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,</p>

<p>But he must die tomorrow?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  None, sir, none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>As near the dawning, provost, as it is,</p>

<p>You shall hear more ere morning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Happily</p>

<p>You something know, yet I believe there comes</p>

<p>No countermand. No such example have we.</p>

<p>Besides, upon the very siege of justice</p>

<p>Lord Angelo hath to the public ear</p>

<p>Professed the contrary.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>This is his Lordship’s man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  And here comes Claudio’s pardon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc> <i>[giving Provost a paper]</i>  My lord hath sent</p>

<p>you this note, and by me this further charge: that</p>

<p>you swerve not from the smallest article of it,</p>

<p>neither in time, matter, or other circumstance.</p>

<p>Good morrow, for, as I take it, it is almost day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  I shall obey him.     <i><i>[Provost reads message.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[Messenger exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>This is his pardon, purchased by such sin</p>

<p>For which the pardoner himself is in.</p>

<p>Hence hath offense his quick celerity</p>

<p>When it is borne in high authority.</p>

<p>When vice makes mercy, mercy’s so extended</p>

<p>That for the fault’s love is th’ offender friended.</p>

<p><i>[As Friar.]</i> Now, sir, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  I told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me</p>

<p>remiss in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted</p>

<p>putting-on, methinks strangely; for he hath</p>

<p>not used it before.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Pray you let’s hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc> <i>[reads the letter.]</i></p>

<p>Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let Claudio</p>

<p>be executed by four of the clock, and in the afternoon</p>

<p>Barnardine. For my better satisfaction, let me have</p>

<p>Claudio’s head sent me by five. Let this be duly</p>

<p>performed with a thought that more depends on it</p>

<p>than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not to do your</p>

<p>office, as you will answer it at your peril.</p>

<p>What say you to this, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  What is that Barnardine who is to be</p>

<p>executed in th’ afternoon?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  A Bohemian born, but here nursed up and</p>

<p>bred; one that is a prisoner nine years old.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  How came it that the absent duke had</p>

<p>not either delivered him to his liberty, or executed</p>

<p>him? I have heard it was ever his manner to do so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  His friends still wrought reprieves for him;</p>

<p>and indeed his fact, till now in the government of</p>

<p>Lord Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  It is now apparent?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Most manifest, and not denied by himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Hath he borne himself penitently in</p>

<p>prison? How seems he to be touched?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully</p>

<p>but as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and</p>

<p>fearless of what’s past, present, or to come; insensible</p>

<p>of mortality and desperately mortal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  He wants advice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  He will hear none. He hath evermore had the</p>

<p>liberty of the prison; give him leave to escape</p>

<p>hence, he would not. Drunk many times a day, if not</p>

<p>many days entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked</p>

<p>him, as if to carry him to execution, and showed</p>

<p>him a seeming warrant for it. It hath not moved him</p>

<p>at all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  More of him anon. There is written in</p>

<p>your brow, provost, honesty and constancy; if I read</p>

<p>it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me. But in the</p>

<p>boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.</p>

<p>Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is</p>

<p>no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo, who hath</p>

<p>sentenced him. To make you understand this in a</p>

<p>manifested effect, I crave but four days’ respite, for</p>

<p>the which you are to do me both a present and a</p>

<p>dangerous courtesy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Pray, sir, in what?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  In the delaying death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Alack, how may I do it, having the hour</p>

<p>limited, and an express command, under penalty,</p>

<p>to deliver his head in the view of Angelo? I may</p>

<p>make my case as Claudio’s, to cross this in the</p>

<p>smallest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  By the vow of mine order I warrant</p>

<p>you, if my instructions may be your guide. Let this</p>

<p>Barnardine be this morning executed and his head</p>

<p>borne to Angelo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Angelo hath seen them both and will discover</p>

<p>the favor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  O, death’s a great disguiser, and you</p>

<p>may add to it. Shave the head and tie the beard, and</p>

<p>say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared</p>

<p>before his death. You know the course is common.</p>

<p>If anything fall to you upon this, more than thanks</p>

<p>and good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I</p>

<p>will plead against it with my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Pardon me, good father, it is against my oath.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Were you sworn to the Duke or to the</p>

<p>Deputy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  To him and to his substitutes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  You will think you have made no</p>

<p>offense if the Duke avouch the justice of your</p>

<p>dealing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  But what likelihood is in that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Not a resemblance, but a certainty; yet</p>

<p>since I see you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity,</p>

<p>nor persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will</p>

<p>go further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of</p>

<p>you. Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the</p>

<p>Duke. <i>[He shows the Provost a paper.]</i> You know the</p>

<p>character, I doubt not, and the signet is not strange</p>

<p>to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  I know them both.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  The contents of this is the return of the</p>

<p>Duke; you shall anon overread it at your pleasure,</p>

<p>where you shall find within these two days he will</p>

<p>be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows not, for</p>

<p>he this very day receives letters of strange tenor,</p>

<p>perchance of the Duke’s death, perchance entering</p>

<p>into some monastery, but by chance nothing of</p>

<p>what is writ. Look, th’ unfolding star calls up the</p>

<p>shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how</p>

<p>these things should be. All difficulties are but easy</p>

<p>when they are known. Call your executioner, and</p>

<p>off with Barnardine’s head. I will give him a present</p>

<p>shrift, and advise him for a better place. Yet you are</p>

<p>amazed, but this shall absolutely resolve you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives the Provost the paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>Come away; it is almost clear dawn.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
