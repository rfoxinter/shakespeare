<p><center><i>[Enter Mariana, and Boy singing.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Song.</p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>     <i>Take, O take those lips away,</i></p>

<p>        <i>That so sweetly were forsworn,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And those eyes, the break of day,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Lights that do mislead the morn.</i></p>

<p>     <i>But my kisses bring again, bring again,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Duke as a Friar.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc> <i>[to Boy]</i></p>

<p>Break off thy song and haste thee quick away.</p>

<p>Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice</p>

<p>Hath often stilled my brawling discontent.</p>

<p><center><i>[Boy exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>I cry you mercy, sir, and well could wish</p>

<p>You had not found me here so musical.</p>

<p>Let me excuse me, and believe me so,</p>

<p>My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>’Tis good, though music oft hath such a charm</p>

<p>To make bad good and good provoke to harm.</p>

<p>I pray you tell me, hath anybody inquired for me</p>

<p>here today? Much upon this time have I promised</p>

<p>here to meet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  You have not been inquired after. I have sat</p>

<p>here all day.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Isabella.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  I do constantly believe you. The time is</p>

<p>come even now. I shall crave your forbearance a</p>

<p>little. Maybe I will call upon you anon for some</p>

<p>advantage to yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  I am always bound to you.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Very well met, and welcome.</p>

<p>What is the news from this good deputy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>He hath a garden circummured with brick,</p>

<p>Whose western side is with a vineyard backed;</p>

<p>And to that vineyard is a planched gate</p>

<p>That makes his opening with this bigger key.</p>

<p>This other doth command a little door</p>

<p>Which from the vineyard to the garden leads.</p>

<p>There have I made my promise, upon the</p>

<p>Heavy middle of the night, to call upon him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>But shall you on your knowledge find this way?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>I have ta’en a due and wary note upon ’t.</p>

<p>With whispering and most guilty diligence,</p>

<p>In action all of precept, he did show me</p>

<p>The way twice o’er.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Are there no other tokens</p>

<p>Between you ’greed concerning her observance?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>No, none, but only a repair i’ th’ dark,</p>

<p>And that I have possessed him my most stay</p>

<p>Can be but brief, for I have made him know</p>

<p>I have a servant comes with me along</p>

<p>That stays upon me, whose persuasion is</p>

<p>I come about my brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  ’Tis well borne up.</p>

<p>I have not yet made known to Mariana</p>

<p>A word of this.–What ho, within; come forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mariana.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><i>[To Mariana.]</i> I pray you be acquainted with this</p>

<p>maid.</p>

<p>She comes to do you good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  I do desire the like.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar, to Mariana]</i></p>

<p>Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc></p>

<p>Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Take then this your companion by the hand,</p>

<p>Who hath a story ready for your ear.</p>

<p>I shall attend your leisure. But make haste.</p>

<p>The vaporous night approaches.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc> <i>[to Isabella]</i>  Will ’t please you walk aside?</p>

<p><center><i>[Isabella and Mariana exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>O place and greatness, millions of false eyes</p>

<p>Are stuck upon thee; volumes of report</p>

<p>Run with these false, and, most contrarious, quest</p>

<p>Upon thy doings; thousand escapes of wit</p>

<p>Make thee the father of their idle dream</p>

<p>And rack thee in their fancies.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mariana and Isabella.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Welcome. How agreed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>She’ll take the enterprise upon her, father,</p>

<p>If you advise it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  It is not my consent</p>

<p>But my entreaty too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc> <i>[to Mariana]</i>  Little have you to say</p>

<p>When you depart from him, but, soft and low,</p>

<p>“Remember now my brother.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  Fear me not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.</p>

<p>He is your husband on a precontract.</p>

<p>To bring you thus together ’tis no sin,</p>

<p>Sith that the justice of your title to him</p>

<p>Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go.</p>

<p>Our corn’s to reap, for yet our tithe’s to sow.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
