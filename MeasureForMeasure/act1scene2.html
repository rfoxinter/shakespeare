<p><center><i>[Enter Lucio and two other Gentlemen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  If the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to</p>

<p>composition with the King of Hungary, why then all</p>

<p>the dukes fall upon the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Heaven grant us its peace, but not</p>

<p>the King of Hungary’s!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Thou conclud’st like the sanctimonious pirate</p>

<p>that went to sea with the ten commandments but</p>

<p>scraped one out of the table.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  “Thou shalt not steal”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Ay, that he razed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Why, ’twas a commandment to command</p>

<p>the Captain and all the rest from their functions!</p>

<p>They put forth to steal. There’s not a soldier of</p>

<p>us all that in the thanksgiving before meat do relish</p>

<p>the petition well that prays for peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  I never heard any soldier dislike it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  I believe thee, for I think thou never wast where</p>

<p>grace was said.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  No? A dozen times at least.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  What? In meter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  In any proportion or in any language.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  I think, or in any religion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all</p>

<p>controversy; as, for example, thou thyself art a</p>

<p>wicked villain, despite of all grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Well, there went but a pair of shears</p>

<p>between us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  I grant, as there may between the lists and the</p>

<p>velvet. Thou art the list.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  And thou the velvet. Thou art good</p>

<p>velvet; thou ’rt a three-piled piece, I warrant thee. I</p>

<p>had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be piled,</p>

<p>as thou art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak</p>

<p>feelingly now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  I think thou dost, and indeed with most painful</p>

<p>feeling of thy speech. I will, out of thine own</p>

<p>confession, learn to begin thy health, but, whilst I</p>

<p>live, forget to drink after thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  I think I have done myself wrong,</p>

<p>have I not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Yes, that thou hast, whether thou</p>

<p>art tainted or free.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mistress Overdone, a Bawd.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation</p>

<p>comes! I have purchased as many diseases under</p>

<p>her roof as come to–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  To what, I pray?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Judge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  To three thousand dolors a year.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Ay, and more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  A French crown more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Thou art always figuring diseases in</p>

<p>me, but thou art full of error. I am sound.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Nay, not, as one would say, healthy, but so sound</p>

<p>as things that are hollow. Thy bones are hollow.</p>

<p>Impiety has made a feast of thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span> <i>[to Bawd]</i>  How now, which of your</p>

<p>hips has the most profound sciatica?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Well, well. There’s one yonder arrested and</p>

<p>carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Who’s that, I pray thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Marry, sir, that’s Claudio, Signior Claudio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Claudio to prison? ’Tis not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Nay, but I know ’tis so. I saw him arrested, saw</p>

<p>him carried away; and, which is more, within these</p>

<p>three days his head to be chopped off.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so!</p>

<p>Art thou sure of this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  I am too sure of it. And it is for getting Madam</p>

<p>Julietta with child.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Believe me, this may be. He promised to meet</p>

<p>me two hours since, and he was ever precise in</p>

<p>promise-keeping.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Besides, you know, it draws something</p>

<p>near to the speech we had to such a purpose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  But most of all agreeing with the</p>

<p>proclamation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Away. Let’s go learn the truth of it.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lucio and Gentlemen exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat,</p>

<p>what with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am</p>

<p>custom-shrunk.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pompey.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now? What’s the news with you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  Yonder man is carried to prison.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Well, what has he done?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  A woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  But what’s his offense?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  What? Is there a maid with child by him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  No, but there’s a woman with maid by him.</p>

<p>You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  What proclamation, man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be</p>

<p>plucked down.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  And what shall become of those in the city?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  They shall stand for seed. They had gone down</p>

<p>too, but that a wise burgher put in for them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs</p>

<p>be pulled down?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  To the ground, mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  Why, here’s a change indeed in the commonwealth!</p>

<p>What shall become of me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  Come, fear not you. Good counselors lack no</p>

<p>clients. Though you change your place, you need</p>

<p>not change your trade. I’ll be your tapster still.</p>

<p>Courage. There will be pity taken on you. You that</p>

<p>have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you</p>

<p>will be considered.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Provost, Claudio, Juliet, and Officers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bawd</span>  What’s to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let’s</p>

<p>withdraw.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the Provost</p>

<p>to prison. And there’s Madam Juliet.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bawd and Pompey exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span> <i>[to Provost]</i></p>

<p>Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to th’ world?</p>

<p>Bear me to prison, where I am committed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span></p>

<p>I do it not in evil disposition,</p>

<p>But from Lord Angelo by special charge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>Thus can the demigod Authority</p>

<p>Make us pay down for our offense, by weight,</p>

<p>The words of heaven: on whom it will, it will;</p>

<p>On whom it will not, so; yet still ’tis just.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucio and Second Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span></p>

<p>Why, how now, Claudio? Whence comes this</p>

<p>restraint?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty.</p>

<p>As surfeit is the father of much fast,</p>

<p>So every scope by the immoderate use</p>

<p>Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,</p>

<p>Like rats that raven down their proper bane,</p>

<p>A thirsty evil, and when we drink, we die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I</p>

<p>would send for certain of my creditors. And yet, to</p>

<p>say the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of</p>

<p>freedom as the mortality of imprisonment. What’s</p>

<p>thy offense, Claudio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>What but to speak of would offend again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  What, is ’t murder?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Lechery?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Call it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span>  Away, sir. You must go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>One word, good friend.–Lucio, a word with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  A hundred, if they’ll do you any good. Is lechery</p>

<p>so looked after?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract</p>

<p>I got possession of Julietta’s bed.</p>

<p>You know the lady. She is fast my wife,</p>

<p>Save that we do the denunciation lack</p>

<p>Of outward order. This we came not to</p>

<p>Only for propagation of a dower</p>

<p>Remaining in the coffer of her friends,</p>

<p>From whom we thought it meet to hide our love</p>

<p>Till time had made them for us. But it chances</p>

<p>The stealth of our most mutual entertainment</p>

<p>With character too gross is writ on Juliet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span></p>

<p>With child, perhaps?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Unhappily, even so.</p>

<p>And the new deputy now for the Duke–</p>

<p>Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,</p>

<p>Or whether that the body public be</p>

<p>A horse whereon the governor doth ride,</p>

<p>Who, newly in the seat, that it may know</p>

<p>He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;</p>

<p>Whether the tyranny be in his place</p>

<p>Or in his eminence that fills it up,</p>

<p>I stagger in–but this new governor</p>

<p>Awakes me all the enrolled penalties</p>

<p>Which have, like unscoured armor, hung by th’ wall</p>

<p>So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round,</p>

<p>And none of them been worn; and for a name</p>

<p>Now puts the drowsy and neglected act</p>

<p>Freshly on me. ’Tis surely for a name.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  I warrant it is. And thy head stands so tickle on</p>

<p>thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may</p>

<p>sigh it off. Send after the Duke and appeal to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>I have done so, but he’s not to be found.</p>

<p>I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:</p>

<p>This day my sister should the cloister enter</p>

<p>And there receive her approbation.</p>

<p>Acquaint her with the danger of my state;</p>

<p>Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends</p>

<p>To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him.</p>

<p>I have great hope in that, for in her youth</p>

<p>There is a prone and speechless dialect</p>

<p>Such as move men. Besides, she hath prosperous art</p>

<p>When she will play with reason and discourse,</p>

<p>And well she can persuade.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  I pray she may, as well for the encouragement of</p>

<p>the like, which else would stand under grievous</p>

<p>imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I</p>

<p>would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a</p>

<p>game of tick-tack. I’ll to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  I thank you, good friend Lucio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Within two hours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Come, officer, away.</p>
