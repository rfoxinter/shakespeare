<p><center><i>[Enter Duke as a Friar, Claudio, and Provost.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>The miserable have no other medicine</p>

<p>But only hope.</p>

<p>I have hope to live and am prepared to die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Be absolute for death. Either death or life</p>

<p>Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:</p>

<p>If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</p>

<p>That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,</p>

<p>Servile to all the skyey influences</p>

<p>That doth this habitation where thou keep’st</p>

<p>Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art death’s fool,</p>

<p>For him thou labor’st by thy flight to shun,</p>

<p>And yet runn’st toward him still. Thou art not noble,</p>

<p>For all th’ accommodations that thou bear’st</p>

<p>Are nursed by baseness. Thou ’rt by no means</p>

<p>valiant,</p>

<p>For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork</p>

<p>Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,</p>

<p>And that thou oft provok’st, yet grossly fear’st</p>

<p>Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself,</p>

<p>For thou exists on many a thousand grains</p>

<p>That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not,</p>

<p>For what thou hast not, still thou striv’st to get,</p>

<p>And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain,</p>

<p>For thy complexion shifts to strange effects</p>

<p>After the moon. If thou art rich, thou ’rt poor,</p>

<p>For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,</p>

<p>Thou bear’st thy heavy riches but a journey,</p>

<p>And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none,</p>

<p>For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,</p>

<p>The mere effusion of thy proper loins,</p>

<p>Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum</p>

<p>For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor</p>

<p>age,</p>

<p>But as it were an after-dinner’s sleep</p>

<p>Dreaming on both, for all thy blessed youth</p>

<p>Becomes as aged and doth beg the alms</p>

<p>Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,</p>

<p>Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty</p>

<p>To make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this</p>

<p>That bears the name of life? Yet in this life</p>

<p>Lie hid more thousand deaths; yet death we fear,</p>

<p>That makes these odds all even.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  I humbly thank you.</p>

<p>To sue to live, I find I seek to die,</p>

<p>And seeking death, find life. Let it come on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>What ho! Peace here, grace, and good company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span></p>

<p>Who’s there? Come in. The wish deserves a welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar, to Claudio]</i></p>

<p>Dear sir, ere long I’ll visit you again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Most holy sir, I thank you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Isabella.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span> <i>[to Provost]</i></p>

<p>My business is a word or two with Claudio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span></p>

<p>And very welcome.–Look, signior, here’s your</p>

<p>sister.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Provost, a word with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span>  As many as you please.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar, aside to Provost]</i></p>

<p>Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be</p>

<p>concealed.</p>

<p><center><i>[Duke and Provost exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Now, sister, what’s the comfort?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Why,</p>

<p>As all comforts are, most good, most good indeed.</p>

<p>Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,</p>

<p>Intends you for his swift ambassador,</p>

<p>Where you shall be an everlasting leiger;</p>

<p>Therefore your best appointment make with speed.</p>

<p>Tomorrow you set on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Is there no remedy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>None but such remedy as, to save a head,</p>

<p>To cleave a heart in twain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  But is there any?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Yes, brother, you may live.</p>

<p>There is a devilish mercy in the judge,</p>

<p>If you’ll implore it, that will free your life</p>

<p>But fetter you till death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Perpetual durance?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,</p>

<p>Though all the world’s vastidity you had,</p>

<p>To a determined scope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  But in what nature?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>In such a one as, you consenting to ’t,</p>

<p>Would bark your honor from that trunk you bear</p>

<p>And leave you naked.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Let me know the point.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>O, I do fear thee, Claudio, and I quake</p>

<p>Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,</p>

<p>And six or seven winters more respect</p>

<p>Than a perpetual honor. Dar’st thou die?</p>

<p>The sense of death is most in apprehension,</p>

<p>And the poor beetle that we tread upon</p>

<p>In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great</p>

<p>As when a giant dies.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Why give you me this shame?</p>

<p>Think you I can a resolution fetch</p>

<p>From flowery tenderness? If I must die,</p>

<p>I will encounter darkness as a bride,</p>

<p>And hug it in mine arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>There spake my brother! There my father’s grave</p>

<p>Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die.</p>

<p>Thou art too noble to conserve a life</p>

<p>In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy–</p>

<p>Whose settled visage and deliberate word</p>

<p>Nips youth i’ th’ head, and follies doth enew</p>

<p>As falcon doth the fowl–is yet a devil.</p>

<p>His filth within being cast, he would appear</p>

<p>A pond as deep as hell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  The prenzie Angelo?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>O, ’tis the cunning livery of hell</p>

<p>The damned’st body to invest and cover</p>

<p>In prenzie guards. Dost thou think, Claudio,</p>

<p>If I would yield him my virginity</p>

<p>Thou mightst be freed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  O heavens, it cannot be!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Yes, he would give ’t thee; from this rank offense,</p>

<p>So to offend him still. This night’s the time</p>

<p>That I should do what I abhor to name,</p>

<p>Or else thou diest tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Thou shalt not do ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  O, were it but my life,</p>

<p>I’d throw it down for your deliverance</p>

<p>As frankly as a pin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Thanks, dear Isabel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Yes. Has he affections in him</p>

<p>That thus can make him bite the law by th’ nose,</p>

<p>When he would force it? Sure it is no sin,</p>

<p>Or of the deadly seven it is the least.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Which is the least?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>If it were damnable, he being so wise,</p>

<p>Why would he for the momentary trick</p>

<p>Be perdurably fined? O, Isabel–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>What says my brother?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Death is a fearful thing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  And shamed life a hateful.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>Ay, but to die, and go we know not where,</p>

<p>To lie in cold obstruction and to rot,</p>

<p>This sensible warm motion to become</p>

<p>A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit</p>

<p>To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside</p>

<p>In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice,</p>

<p>To be imprisoned in the viewless winds</p>

<p>And blown with restless violence round about</p>

<p>The pendent world; or to be worse than worst</p>

<p>Of those that lawless and incertain thought</p>

<p>Imagine howling–’tis too horrible.</p>

<p>The weariest and most loathed worldly life</p>

<p>That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment</p>

<p>Can lay on nature is a paradise</p>

<p>To what we fear of death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Alas, alas!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Sweet sister, let me live.</p>

<p>What sin you do to save a brother’s life,</p>

<p>Nature dispenses with the deed so far</p>

<p>That it becomes a virtue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  O, you beast!</p>

<p>O faithless coward, O dishonest wretch,</p>

<p>Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?</p>

<p>Is ’t not a kind of incest to take life</p>

<p>From thine own sister’s shame? What should I think?</p>

<p>Heaven shield my mother played my father fair,</p>

<p>For such a warped slip of wilderness</p>

<p>Ne’er issued from his blood. Take my defiance;</p>

<p>Die, perish. Might but my bending down</p>

<p>Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed.</p>

<p>I’ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,</p>

<p>No word to save thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Nay, hear me, Isabel–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  O, fie, fie, fie!</p>

<p>Thy sin’s not accidental, but a trade.</p>

<p>Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd.</p>

<p>’Tis best that thou diest quickly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  O, hear me, Isabella–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Duke as a Friar.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar, to Isabella]</i></p>

<p>Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  What is your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Might you dispense with your leisure, I</p>

<p>would by and by have some speech with you. The</p>

<p>satisfaction I would require is likewise your own</p>

<p>benefit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  I have no superfluous leisure. My stay must</p>

<p>be stolen out of other affairs, but I will attend you</p>

<p>awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar, taking Claudio aside]</i>  Son, I have overheard</p>

<p>what hath passed between you and your</p>

<p>sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her;</p>

<p>only he hath made an assay of her virtue, to practice</p>

<p>his judgment with the disposition of natures. She,</p>

<p>having the truth of honor in her, hath made him</p>

<p>that gracious denial which he is most glad to</p>

<p>receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this</p>

<p>to be true. Therefore prepare yourself to death. Do</p>

<p>not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are</p>

<p>fallible. Tomorrow you must die. Go to your knees</p>

<p>and make ready.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of</p>

<p>love with life that I will sue to be rid of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Hold you there. Farewell.–Provost, a</p>

<p>word with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Provost.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span>  What’s your will, father?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  That now you are come, you will be</p>

<p>gone. Leave me awhile with the maid. My mind</p>

<p>promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by</p>

<p>my company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span>  In good time.     <i><i>[He exits, with Claudio.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar, to Isabella]</i>  The hand that hath made</p>

<p>you fair hath made you good. The goodness that is</p>

<p>cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness,</p>

<p>but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall</p>

<p>keep the body of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo</p>

<p>hath made to you, fortune hath conveyed to my</p>

<p>understanding; and but that frailty hath examples</p>

<p>for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How will</p>

<p>you do to content this substitute and to save your</p>

<p>brother?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  I am now going to resolve him. I had rather</p>

<p>my brother die by the law than my son should be</p>

<p>unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good</p>

<p>duke deceived in Angelo! If ever he return, and I</p>

<p>can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or</p>

<p>discover his government.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  That shall not be much amiss. Yet, as</p>

<p>the matter now stands, he will avoid your accusation:</p>

<p>he made trial of you only. Therefore, fasten</p>

<p>your ear on my advisings. To the love I have in doing</p>

<p>good, a remedy presents itself. I do make myself</p>

<p>believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor</p>

<p>wronged lady a merited benefit, redeem your brother</p>

<p>from the angry law, do no stain to your own</p>

<p>gracious person, and much please the absent duke,</p>

<p>if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing</p>

<p>of this business.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to</p>

<p>do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my</p>

<p>spirit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Virtue is bold, and goodness never</p>

<p>fearful. Have you not heard speak of Mariana, the</p>

<p>sister of Frederick, the great soldier who miscarried</p>

<p>at sea?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  I have heard of the lady, and good words</p>

<p>went with her name.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  She should this Angelo have married,</p>

<p>was affianced to her oath, and the nuptial appointed.</p>

<p>Between which time of the contract and</p>

<p>limit of the solemnity, her brother Frederick was</p>

<p>wracked at sea, having in that perished vessel the</p>

<p>dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this befell</p>

<p>to the poor gentlewoman. There she lost a noble</p>

<p>and renowned brother, in his love toward her ever</p>

<p>most kind and natural; with him, the portion and</p>

<p>sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry; with</p>

<p>both, her combinate husband, this well-seeming</p>

<p>Angelo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Left her in her tears and dried not one</p>

<p>of them with his comfort, swallowed his vows</p>

<p>whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonor; in</p>

<p>few, bestowed her on her own lamentation, which</p>

<p>she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her</p>

<p>tears, is washed with them but relents not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  What a merit were it in death to take this</p>

<p>poor maid from the world! What corruption in this</p>

<p>life, that it will let this man live! But how out of this</p>

<p>can she avail?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  It is a rupture that you may easily heal,</p>

<p>and the cure of it not only saves your brother, but</p>

<p>keeps you from dishonor in doing it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Show me how, good father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  This forenamed maid hath yet in her</p>

<p>the continuance of her first affection. His unjust</p>

<p>unkindness, that in all reason should have</p>

<p>quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the</p>

<p>current, made it more violent and unruly. Go you to</p>

<p>Angelo, answer his requiring with a plausible obedience,</p>

<p>agree with his demands to the point. Only</p>

<p>refer yourself to this advantage: first, that your stay</p>

<p>with him may not be long, that the time may have all</p>

<p>shadow and silence in it, and the place answer to</p>

<p>convenience. This being granted in course, and</p>

<p>now follows all: we shall advise this wronged maid</p>

<p>to stead up your appointment, go in your place. If</p>

<p>the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may</p>

<p>compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is</p>

<p>your brother saved, your honor untainted, the poor</p>

<p>Mariana advantaged, and the corrupt deputy</p>

<p>scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for his</p>

<p>attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may,</p>

<p>the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit</p>

<p>from reproof. What think you of it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  The image of it gives me content already, and</p>

<p>I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  It lies much in your holding up. Haste</p>

<p>you speedily to Angelo. If for this night he entreat</p>

<p>you to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I</p>

<p>will presently to Saint Luke’s. There at the moated</p>

<p>grange resides this dejected Mariana. At that place</p>

<p>call upon me, and dispatch with Angelo that it may</p>

<p>be quickly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well,</p>

<p>good father.</p>
