<p><center><i>[Enter Angelo, Escalus, Servants, and a Justice.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>We must not make a scarecrow of the law,</p>

<p>Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,</p>

<p>And let it keep one shape till custom make it</p>

<p>Their perch and not their terror.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Ay, but yet</p>

<p>Let us be keen and rather cut a little</p>

<p>Than fall and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman</p>

<p>Whom I would save had a most noble father.</p>

<p>Let but your Honor know,</p>

<p>Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,</p>

<p>That, in the working of your own affections,</p>

<p>Had time cohered with place, or place with wishing,</p>

<p>Or that the resolute acting of your blood</p>

<p>Could have attained th’ effect of your own purpose,</p>

<p>Whether you had not sometime in your life</p>

<p>Erred in this point which now you censure him,</p>

<p>And pulled the law upon you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>’Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,</p>

<p>Another thing to fall. I not deny</p>

<p>The jury passing on the prisoner’s life</p>

<p>May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two</p>

<p>Guiltier than him they try. What’s open made to</p>

<p>justice,</p>

<p>That justice seizes. What knows the laws</p>

<p>That thieves do pass on thieves? ’Tis very pregnant,</p>

<p>The jewel that we find, we stoop and take ’t</p>

<p>Because we see it; but what we do not see,</p>

<p>We tread upon and never think of it.</p>

<p>You may not so extenuate his offense</p>

<p>For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,</p>

<p>When I that censure him do so offend,</p>

<p>Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,</p>

<p>And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Provost.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc></p>

<p>Be it as your wisdom will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  Where is the Provost?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc></p>

<p>Here, if it like your Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  See that Claudio</p>

<p>Be executed by nine tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared,</p>

<p>For that’s the utmost of his pilgrimage.</p>

<p><center><i>[Provost exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc></p>

<p>Well, heaven forgive him and forgive us all.</p>

<p>Some rise by sin and some by virtue fall.</p>

<p>Some run from brakes of ice and answer none,</p>

<p>And some condemned for a fault alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Elbow and Officers, with Froth</p>

<p>and Pompey.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc> <i>[to Officers]</i>  Come, bring them away. If these</p>

<p>be good people in a commonweal that do nothing</p>

<p>but use their abuses in common houses, I know no</p>

<p>law. Bring them away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  How now, sir, what’s your name? And what’s</p>

<p>the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  If it please your Honor, I am the poor duke’s</p>

<p>constable, and my name is Elbow. I do lean upon</p>

<p>justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good</p>

<p>Honor two notorious benefactors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  Benefactors? Well, what benefactors are they?</p>

<p>Are they not malefactors?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  If it please your Honor, I know not well what</p>

<p>they are, but precise villains they are, that I am sure</p>

<p>of, and void of all profanation in the world that</p>

<p>good Christians ought to have.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc> <i>[to Angelo]</i>  This comes off well. Here’s a wise</p>

<p>officer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc> <i>[to Elbow]</i>  Go to. What quality are they of?</p>

<p>Elbow is your name? Why dost thou not speak,</p>

<p>Elbow?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  He cannot, sir. He’s out at elbow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  What are you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  He, sir? A tapster, sir, parcel bawd; one that</p>

<p>serves a bad woman, whose house, sir, was, as they</p>

<p>say, plucked down in the suburbs, and now she</p>

<p>professes a hothouse, which I think is a very ill</p>

<p>house too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  How know you that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and</p>

<p>your Honor–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  How? Thy wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  Ay, sir, whom I thank heaven is an honest</p>

<p>woman–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Dost thou detest her therefore?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she,</p>

<p>that this house, if it be not a bawd’s house, it is pity</p>

<p>of her life, for it is a naughty house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  How dost thou know that, constable?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  Marry, sir, by my wife, who, if she had been a</p>

<p>woman cardinally given, might have been accused</p>

<p>in fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness</p>

<p>there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  By the woman’s means?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone’s means; but as</p>

<p>she spit in his face, so she defied him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc> <i>[to Escalus]</i>  Sir, if it please your Honor, this is</p>

<p>not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  Prove it before these varlets here, thou honorable</p>

<p>man, prove it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc> <i>[to Angelo]</i>  Do you hear how he misplaces?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Sir, she came in great with child, and longing,</p>

<p>saving your Honor’s reverence, for stewed prunes.</p>

<p>Sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very</p>

<p>distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit dish, a dish</p>

<p>of some threepence; your Honors have seen such</p>

<p>dishes; they are not china dishes, but very good</p>

<p>dishes–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Go to, go to. No matter for the dish, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in</p>

<p>the right. But to the point: as I say, this Mistress</p>

<p>Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and being great-bellied,</p>

<p>and longing, as I said, for prunes; and</p>

<p>having but two in the dish, as I said, Master Froth</p>

<p>here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I said,</p>

<p>and, as I say, paying for them very honestly–for, as</p>

<p>you know, Master Froth, I could not give you threepence</p>

<p>again–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Froth</sc>  No, indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Very well. You being then, if you be remembered,</p>

<p>cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Froth</sc>  Ay, so I did indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Why, very well. I telling you then, if you be</p>

<p>remembered, that such a one and such a one were</p>

<p>past cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept</p>

<p>very good diet, as I told you–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Froth</sc>  All this is true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Why, very well then–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose:</p>

<p>what was done to Elbow’s wife that he hath cause to</p>

<p>complain of? Come me to what was done to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Sir, your Honor cannot come to that yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  No, sir, nor I mean it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Sir, but you shall come to it, by your Honor’s</p>

<p>leave. And I beseech you, look into Master Froth</p>

<p>here, sir, a man of fourscore pound a year, whose</p>

<p>father died at Hallowmas–was ’t not at Hallowmas,</p>

<p>Master Froth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Froth</sc>  All-hallond Eve.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Why, very well. I hope here be truths.–He,</p>

<p>sir, sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir–<i>[To Froth.]</i></p>

<p>’Twas in the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you</p>

<p>have a delight to sit, have you not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Froth</sc>  I have so, because it is an open room, and good</p>

<p>for winter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Why, very well then. I hope here be truths.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc> <i>[to Escalus]</i></p>

<p>This will last out a night in Russia</p>

<p>When nights are longest there. I’ll take my leave,</p>

<p>And leave you to the hearing of the cause,</p>

<p>Hoping you’ll find good cause to whip them all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc></p>

<p>I think no less. Good morrow to your Lordship</p>

<p><center><i>[Angelo exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now, sir, come on. What was done to Elbow’s wife,</p>

<p>once more?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Once, sir? There was nothing done to her</p>

<p>once.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc> <i>[to Escalus]</i>  I beseech you, sir, ask him what</p>

<p>this man did to my wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc> <i>[to Escalus]</i>  I beseech your Honor, ask me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman’s</p>

<p>face.–Good Master Froth, look upon his Honor.</p>

<p>’Tis for a good purpose.–Doth your Honor mark</p>

<p>his face?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Ay, sir, very well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Well, I do so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Doth your Honor see any harm in his face?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Why, no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  I’ll be supposed upon a book, his face is the</p>

<p>worst thing about him. Good, then, if his face be the</p>

<p>worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do</p>

<p>the Constable’s wife any harm? I would know that</p>

<p>of your Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  He’s in the right, constable. What say you to</p>

<p>it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  First, an it like you, the house is a respected</p>

<p>house; next, this is a respected fellow, and his</p>

<p>mistress is a respected woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected</p>

<p>person than any of us all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! The</p>

<p>time is yet to come that she was ever respected with</p>

<p>man, woman, or child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Sir, she was respected with him before he</p>

<p>married with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity?</p>

<p>Is this true?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc> <i>[to Pompey]</i>  O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O</p>

<p>thou wicked Hannibal! I respected with her before I</p>

<p>was married to her?–If ever I was respected with</p>

<p>her, or she with me, let not your Worship think me</p>

<p>the poor duke’s officer.–Prove this, thou wicked</p>

<p>Hannibal, or I’ll have mine action of batt’ry on thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  If he took you a box o’ th’ ear, you might have</p>

<p>your action of slander too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  Marry, I thank your good Worship for it. What</p>

<p>is ’t your Worship’s pleasure I shall do with this</p>

<p>wicked caitiff?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Truly, officer, because he hath some offenses</p>

<p>in him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst,</p>

<p>let him continue in his courses till thou know’st</p>

<p>what they are.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  Marry, I thank your Worship for it. <i>[To Pompey.]</i></p>

<p>Thou seest, thou wicked varlet, now, what’s</p>

<p>come upon thee. Thou art to continue now, thou</p>

<p>varlet, thou art to continue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc> <i>[to Froth]</i>  Where were you born, friend?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Froth</sc>  Here in Vienna, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Are you of fourscore pounds a year?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Froth</sc>  Yes, an ’t please you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  So. <i>[To Pompey.]</i> What trade are you of, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  A tapster, a poor widow’s tapster.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Your mistress’ name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Mistress Overdone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Hath she had any more than one husband?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Nine, sir. Overdone by the last.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Nine?–Come hither to me, Master Froth.</p>

<p>Master Froth, I would not have you acquainted with</p>

<p>tapsters; they will draw you, Master Froth, and you</p>

<p>will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no</p>

<p>more of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Froth</sc>  I thank your Worship. For mine own part, I</p>

<p>never come into any room in a taphouse but I am</p>

<p>drawn in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Well, no more of it, Master Froth. Farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[Froth exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Come you hither to me, Master Tapster. What’s your</p>

<p>name, Master Tapster?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Pompey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  What else?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Bum, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing</p>

<p>about you, so that in the beastliest sense you are</p>

<p>Pompey the Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd,</p>

<p>Pompey, howsoever you color it in being a tapster,</p>

<p>are you not? Come, tell me true. It shall be the</p>

<p>better for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  How would you live, Pompey? By being a</p>

<p>bawd? What do you think of the trade, Pompey? Is it</p>

<p>a lawful trade?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  If the law would allow it, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  But the law will not allow it, Pompey, nor it</p>

<p>shall not be allowed in Vienna.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Does your Worship mean to geld and splay all</p>

<p>the youth of the city?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  No, Pompey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to ’t</p>

<p>then. If your Worship will take order for the drabs</p>

<p>and the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell</p>

<p>you. It is but heading and hanging.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  If you head and hang all that offend that way</p>

<p>but for ten year together, you’ll be glad to give out a</p>

<p>commission for more heads. If this law hold in</p>

<p>Vienna ten year, I’ll rent the fairest house in it after</p>

<p>threepence a bay. If you live to see this come to</p>

<p>pass, say Pompey told you so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Thank you, good Pompey. And in requital of</p>

<p>your prophecy, hark you: I advise you let me not</p>

<p>find you before me again upon any complaint</p>

<p>whatsoever; no, not for dwelling where you do. If I</p>

<p>do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent and prove</p>

<p>a shrewd Caesar to you. In plain dealing, Pompey, I</p>

<p>shall have you whipped. So, for this time, Pompey,</p>

<p>fare you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  I thank your Worship for your good counsel.</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> But I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune</p>

<p>shall better determine.</p>

<p>Whip me? No, no, let carman whip his jade.</p>

<p>The valiant heart’s not whipped out of his trade.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Come hither to me, Master Elbow. Come</p>

<p>hither, Master Constable. How long have you been</p>

<p>in this place of constable?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  Seven year and a half, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  I thought, by the readiness in the office, you</p>

<p>had continued in it some time. You say seven years</p>

<p>together?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  And a half, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do</p>

<p>you wrong to put you so oft upon ’t. Are there not</p>

<p>men in your ward sufficient to serve it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters. As</p>

<p>they are chosen, they are glad to choose me for</p>

<p>them. I do it for some piece of money and go</p>

<p>through with all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Look you bring me in the names of some six</p>

<p>or seven, the most sufficient of your parish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  To your Worship’s house, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  To my house. Fare you well.</p>

<p><center><i>[Elbow and Officers exit.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Justice.]</i> What’s o’clock, think you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Justice</sc>  Eleven, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  I pray you home to dinner with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Justice</sc>  I humbly thank you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc></p>

<p>It grieves me for the death of Claudio,</p>

<p>But there’s no remedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Justice</sc></p>

<p>Lord Angelo is severe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  It is but needful.</p>

<p>Mercy is not itself that oft looks so.</p>

<p>Pardon is still the nurse of second woe.</p>

<p>But yet, poor Claudio. There is no remedy.</p>

<p>Come, sir.</p>
