<p><center><i>[Enter Isabella and Francisca, a Nun.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>And have you nuns no farther privileges?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nun</sc>  Are not these large enough?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>Yes, truly. I speak not as desiring more,</p>

<p>But rather wishing a more strict restraint</p>

<p>Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Ho, peace be in this place!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  Who’s that which calls?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nun</sc></p>

<p>It is a man’s voice. Gentle Isabella,</p>

<p>Turn you the key and know his business of him.</p>

<p>You may; I may not. You are yet unsworn.</p>

<p>When you have vowed, you must not speak with men</p>

<p>But in the presence of the Prioress.</p>

<p>Then, if you speak, you must not show your face;</p>

<p>Or if you show your face, you must not speak.</p>

<p>He calls again. I pray you answer him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>Peace and prosperity! Who is ’t that calls?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc></p>

<p>Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses</p>

<p>Proclaim you are no less. Can you so stead me</p>

<p>As bring me to the sight of Isabella,</p>

<p>A novice of this place and the fair sister</p>

<p>To her unhappy brother, Claudio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>Why “her unhappy brother”? Let me ask,</p>

<p>The rather for I now must make you know</p>

<p>I am that Isabella, and his sister.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc></p>

<p>Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you.</p>

<p>Not to be weary with you, he’s in prison.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  Woe me, for what?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc></p>

<p>For that which, if myself might be his judge,</p>

<p>He should receive his punishment in thanks:</p>

<p>He hath got his friend with child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>Sir, make me not your story.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  ’Tis true.</p>

<p>I would not, though ’tis my familiar sin</p>

<p>With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,</p>

<p>Tongue far from heart, play with all virgins so.</p>

<p>I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted,</p>

<p>By your renouncement an immortal spirit,</p>

<p>And to be talked with in sincerity</p>

<p>As with a saint.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc></p>

<p>Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, ’tis thus:</p>

<p>Your brother and his lover have embraced;</p>

<p>As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time</p>

<p>That from the seedness the bare fallow brings</p>

<p>To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb</p>

<p>Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>Someone with child by him? My cousin Juliet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Is she your cousin?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>Adoptedly, as schoolmaids change their names</p>

<p>By vain though apt affection.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  She it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>O, let him marry her!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  This is the point.</p>

<p>The Duke is very strangely gone from hence;</p>

<p>Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,</p>

<p>In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn,</p>

<p>By those that know the very nerves of state,</p>

<p>His givings-out were of an infinite distance</p>

<p>From his true-meant design. Upon his place,</p>

<p>And with full line of his authority,</p>

<p>Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood</p>

<p>Is very snow-broth; one who never feels</p>

<p>The wanton stings and motions of the sense,</p>

<p>But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge</p>

<p>With profits of the mind: study and fast.</p>

<p>He–to give fear to use and liberty,</p>

<p>Which have for long run by the hideous law</p>

<p>As mice by lions–hath picked out an act</p>

<p>Under whose heavy sense your brother’s life</p>

<p>Falls into forfeit. He arrests him on it,</p>

<p>And follows close the rigor of the statute</p>

<p>To make him an example. All hope is gone</p>

<p>Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer</p>

<p>To soften Angelo. And that’s my pith of business</p>

<p>’Twixt you and your poor brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  Doth he so</p>

<p>Seek his life?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Has censured him already,</p>

<p>And, as I hear, the Provost hath a warrant</p>

<p>For ’s execution.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>Alas, what poor ability’s in me</p>

<p>To do him good?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Assay the power you have.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>My power? Alas, I doubt–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Our doubts are traitors</p>

<p>And makes us lose the good we oft might win</p>

<p>By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo</p>

<p>And let him learn to know, when maidens sue</p>

<p>Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,</p>

<p>All their petitions are as freely theirs</p>

<p>As they themselves would owe them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  I’ll see what I can do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  But speedily!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  I will about it straight,</p>

<p>No longer staying but to give the Mother</p>

<p>Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you.</p>

<p>Commend me to my brother. Soon at night</p>

<p>I’ll send him certain word of my success.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc></p>

<p>I take my leave of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  Good sir, adieu.</p>
