<p><center><i>[Enter Pompey.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  I am as well acquainted here as I was in our</p>

<p>house of profession. One would think it were Mistress</p>

<p>Overdone’s own house, for here be many of</p>

<p>her old customers. First, here’s young Master Rash.</p>

<p>He’s in for a commodity of brown paper and old</p>

<p>ginger, ninescore and seventeen pounds, of which</p>

<p>he made five marks ready money. Marry, then</p>

<p>ginger was not much in request, for the old women</p>

<p>were all dead. Then is there here one Master Caper,</p>

<p>at the suit of Master Three-pile the mercer, for some</p>

<p>four suits of peach-colored satin, which now</p>

<p>peaches him a beggar. Then have we here young</p>

<p>Dizzy and young Master Deep-vow, and Master</p>

<p>Copper-spur and Master Starve-lackey the rapier-and-dagger</p>

<p>man, and young Drop-heir that killed</p>

<p>lusty Pudding, and Master Forth-light the tilter, and</p>

<p>brave Master Shoe-tie the great traveler, and wild</p>

<p>Half-can that stabbed Pots, and I think forty more,</p>

<p>all great doers in our trade, and are now “for the</p>

<p>Lord’s sake.”</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Abhorson.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Abhorson</span>  Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span> <i>[calling]</i>  Master Barnardine, you must rise</p>

<p>and be hanged, Master Barnardine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Abhorson</span> <i>[calling]</i>  What ho, Barnardine!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Barnardine</span> <i>[within]</i>  A pox o’ your throats! Who makes</p>

<p>that noise there? What are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span> <i>[calling to Barnardine offstage]</i>  Your friends,</p>

<p>sir, the hangman. You must be so good, sir, to rise</p>

<p>and be put to death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Barnardine</span> <i>[within]</i>  Away, you rogue, away! I am</p>

<p>sleepy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Abhorson</span> <i>[to Pompey]</i>  Tell him he must awake, and</p>

<p>that quickly too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span> <i>[calling]</i>  Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till</p>

<p>you are executed, and sleep afterwards.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Abhorson</span>  Go in to him, and fetch him out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  He is coming, sir, he is coming. I hear his</p>

<p>straw rustle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Abhorson</span>  Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  Very ready, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Barnardine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Barnardine</span>  How now, Abhorson? What’s the news</p>

<p>with you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Abhorson</span>  Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into</p>

<p>your prayers, for, look you, the warrant’s come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Barnardine</span>  You rogue, I have been drinking all night.</p>

<p>I am not fitted for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pompey</span>  O, the better, sir, for he that drinks all night</p>

<p>and is hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the</p>

<p>sounder all the next day.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Duke, as a Friar.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Abhorson</span> <i>[to Barnardine]</i>  Look you, sir, here comes</p>

<p>your ghostly father. Do we jest now, think you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar, to Barnardine]</i>  Sir, induced by my</p>

<p>charity, and hearing how hastily you are to depart, I</p>

<p>am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Barnardine</span>  Friar, not I. I have been drinking hard all</p>

<p>night, and I will have more time to prepare me, or</p>

<p>they shall beat out my brains with billets. I will not</p>

<p>consent to die this day, that’s certain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  O, sir, you must. And therefore I</p>

<p>beseech you look forward on the journey you shall</p>

<p>go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Barnardine</span>  I swear I will not die today for any man’s</p>

<p>persuasion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  But hear you–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Barnardine</span>  Not a word. If you have anything to say to</p>

<p>me, come to my ward, for thence will not I today.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Unfit to live or die. O gravel heart!</p>

<p>After him, fellows; bring him to the block.</p>

<p><center><i>[Abhorson and Pompey exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Provost.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span></p>

<p>Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>A creature unprepared, unmeet for death,</p>

<p>And to transport him in the mind he is</p>

<p>Were damnable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span>  Here in the prison, father,</p>

<p>There died this morning of a cruel fever</p>

<p>One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,</p>

<p>A man of Claudio’s years, his beard and head</p>

<p>Just of his color. What if we do omit</p>

<p>This reprobate till he were well inclined,</p>

<p>And satisfy the Deputy with the visage</p>

<p>Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>O, ’tis an accident that heaven provides!</p>

<p>Dispatch it presently. The hour draws on</p>

<p>Prefixed by Angelo. See this be done</p>

<p>And sent according to command, whiles I</p>

<p>Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span></p>

<p>This shall be done, good father, presently.</p>

<p>But Barnardine must die this afternoon,</p>

<p>And how shall we continue Claudio,</p>

<p>To save me from the danger that might come</p>

<p>If he were known alive?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Let this be done:</p>

<p>Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and</p>

<p>Claudio.</p>

<p>Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting</p>

<p>To yonder generation, you shall find</p>

<p>Your safety manifested.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span>  I am your free dependent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.</p>

<p><center><i>[Provost exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>Now will I write letters to Angelo–</p>

<p>The Provost he shall bear them–whose contents</p>

<p>Shall witness to him I am near at home</p>

<p>And that by great injunctions I am bound</p>

<p>To enter publicly. Him I’ll desire</p>

<p>To meet me at the consecrated fount</p>

<p>A league below the city; and from thence,</p>

<p>By cold gradation and well-balanced form,</p>

<p>We shall proceed with Angelo.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Provost, carrying a head.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span></p>

<p>Here is the head. I’ll carry it myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Convenient is it. Make a swift return,</p>

<p>For I would commune with you of such things</p>

<p>That want no ear but yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Provost</span>  I’ll make all speed.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span> <i>[within]</i>  Peace, ho, be here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span></p>

<p>The tongue of Isabel. She’s come to know</p>

<p>If yet her brother’s pardon be come hither.</p>

<p>But I will keep her ignorant of her good</p>

<p>To make her heavenly comforts of despair</p>

<p>When it is least expected.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Isabella.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  Ho, by your leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>The better, given me by so holy a man.</p>

<p>Hath yet the Deputy sent my brother’s pardon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>He hath released him, Isabel, from the world.</p>

<p>His head is off, and sent to Angelo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Nay, but it is not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  It is no other.</p>

<p>Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>You shall not be admitted to his sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span></p>

<p>Unhappy Claudio, wretched Isabel,</p>

<p>Injurious world, most damned Angelo!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot.</p>

<p>Forbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven.</p>

<p>Mark what I say, which you shall find</p>

<p>By every syllable a faithful verity.</p>

<p>The Duke comes home tomorrow–nay, dry your</p>

<p>eyes.</p>

<p>One of our convent, and his confessor,</p>

<p>Gives me this instance. Already he hath carried</p>

<p>Notice to Escalus and Angelo,</p>

<p>Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,</p>

<p>There to give up their power. If you can, pace your</p>

<p>wisdom</p>

<p>In that good path that I would wish it go,</p>

<p>And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,</p>

<p>Grace of the Duke, revenges to your heart,</p>

<p>And general honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Isabella</span>  I am directed by you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar, showing her a paper]</i></p>

<p>This letter, then, to Friar Peter give.</p>

<p>’Tis that he sent me of the Duke’s return.</p>

<p>Say, by this token, I desire his company</p>

<p>At Mariana’s house tonight. Her cause and yours</p>

<p>I’ll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you</p>

<p>Before the Duke, and to the head of Angelo</p>

<p>Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,</p>

<p>I am combined by a sacred vow</p>

<p>And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands her the paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>Command these fretting waters from your eyes</p>

<p>With a light heart. Trust not my holy order</p>

<p>If I pervert your course.–Who’s here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Good even, friar, where’s the Provost?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Not within, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  O, pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see</p>

<p>thine eyes so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to</p>

<p>dine and sup with water and bran. I dare not for my</p>

<p>head fill my belly. One fruitful meal would set me to</p>

<p>’t. But they say the Duke will be here tomorrow. By</p>

<p>my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother. If the old</p>

<p>fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home,</p>

<p>he had lived.     <i><i>[Isabella exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Sir, the Duke is marvelous little beholding</p>

<p>to your reports, but the best is, he lives not</p>

<p>in them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do.</p>

<p>He’s a better woodman than thou tak’st him for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Well, you’ll answer this one day. Fare</p>

<p>you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Nay, tarry, I’ll go along with thee. I can tell thee</p>

<p>pretty tales of the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  You have told me too many of him</p>

<p>already, sir, if they be true; if not true, none were</p>

<p>enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  I was once before him for getting a wench with</p>

<p>child.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Did you such a thing?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  Yes, marry, did I, but I was fain to forswear it.</p>

<p>They would else have married me to the rotten</p>

<p>medlar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duke</span> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Sir, your company is fairer than honest.</p>

<p>Rest you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lucio</span>  By my troth, I’ll go with thee to the lane’s end. If</p>

<p>bawdy talk offend you, we’ll have very little of it.</p>

<p>Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr. I shall stick.</p>
