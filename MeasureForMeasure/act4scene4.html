<p><center><i>[Enter Angelo and Escalus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched</p>

<p>other.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  In most uneven and distracted manner. His</p>

<p>actions show much like to madness. Pray heaven his</p>

<p>wisdom be not tainted. And why meet him at the</p>

<p>gates and deliver our authorities there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  I guess not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  And why should we proclaim it in an hour</p>

<p>before his entering, that if any crave redress of</p>

<p>injustice, they should exhibit their petitions in the</p>

<p>street?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch</p>

<p>of complaints, and to deliver us from devices</p>

<p>hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand</p>

<p>against us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  Well, I beseech you let it be proclaimed.</p>

<p>Betimes i’ th’ morn, I’ll call you at your house. Give</p>

<p>notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet</p>

<p>him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  I shall, sir. Fare you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  Good night.     <i><i>[Escalus exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant</p>

<p>And dull to all proceedings. A deflowered maid,</p>

<p>And by an eminent body that enforced</p>

<p>The law against it. But that her tender shame</p>

<p>Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,</p>

<p>How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no,</p>

<p>For my authority bears of a credent bulk</p>

<p>That no particular scandal once can touch</p>

<p>But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,</p>

<p>Save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense</p>

<p>Might in the times to come have ta’en revenge</p>

<p>By so receiving a dishonored life</p>

<p>With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived.</p>

<p>Alack, when once our grace we have forgot,</p>

<p>Nothing goes right. We would, and we would not.</p>
