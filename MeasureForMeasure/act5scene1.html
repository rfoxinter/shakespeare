<p><center><i>[Enter Duke, Varrius, Lords, Angelo, Escalus, Lucio,</p>

<p>Provost, Officers, and Citizens at several doors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[to Angelo]</i></p>

<p>My very worthy cousin, fairly met.</p>

<p><i>[To Escalus.]</i> Our old and faithful friend, we are</p>

<p>glad to see you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc> <sc>Escalus</sc></p>

<p>Happy return be to your royal Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Many and hearty thankings to you both.</p>

<p>We have made inquiry of you, and we hear</p>

<p>Such goodness of your justice that our soul</p>

<p>Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,</p>

<p>Forerunning more requital.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  You make my bonds still greater.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>O, your desert speaks loud, and I should wrong it</p>

<p>To lock it in the wards of covert bosom</p>

<p>When it deserves with characters of brass</p>

<p>A forted residence ’gainst the tooth of time</p>

<p>And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand</p>

<p>And let the subject see, to make them know</p>

<p>That outward courtesies would fain proclaim</p>

<p>Favors that keep within.–Come, Escalus,</p>

<p>You must walk by us on our other hand.</p>

<p>And good supporters are you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Friar Peter and Isabella.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Peter</sc> <i>[to Isabella]</i></p>

<p>Now is your time. Speak loud, and kneel before him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Justice, O royal duke. Vail your regard</p>

<p>Upon a wronged–I would fain have said, a maid.</p>

<p>O worthy prince, dishonor not your eye</p>

<p>By throwing it on any other object</p>

<p>Till you have heard me in my true complaint</p>

<p>And given me justice, justice, justice, justice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Relate your wrongs. In what, by whom? Be brief.</p>

<p>Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice.</p>

<p>Reveal yourself to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  O worthy duke,</p>

<p>You bid me seek redemption of the devil.</p>

<p>Hear me yourself, for that which I must speak</p>

<p>Must either punish me, not being believed,</p>

<p>Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me,</p>

<p>here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm.</p>

<p>She hath been a suitor to me for her brother</p>

<p>Cut off by course of justice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc> <i>[standing]</i>  By course of justice!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>And she will speak most bitterly and strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>Most strange, but yet most truly will I speak.</p>

<p>That Angelo’s forsworn, is it not strange?</p>

<p>That Angelo’s a murderer, is ’t not strange?</p>

<p>That Angelo is an adulterous thief,</p>

<p>An hypocrite, a virgin-violator,</p>

<p>Is it not strange, and strange?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Nay, it is ten times strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>It is not truer he is Angelo</p>

<p>Than this is all as true as it is strange.</p>

<p>Nay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth</p>

<p>To th’ end of reck’ning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Away with her. Poor soul,</p>

<p>She speaks this in th’ infirmity of sense.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest</p>

<p>There is another comfort than this world,</p>

<p>That thou neglect me not with that opinion</p>

<p>That I am touched with madness. Make not</p>

<p>impossible</p>

<p>That which but seems unlike. ’Tis not impossible</p>

<p>But one, the wicked’st caitiff on the ground,</p>

<p>May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute</p>

<p>As Angelo. Even so may Angelo,</p>

<p>In all his dressings, caracts, titles, forms,</p>

<p>Be an archvillain. Believe it, royal prince,</p>

<p>If he be less, he’s nothing, but he’s more,</p>

<p>Had I more name for badness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  By mine honesty,</p>

<p>If she be mad–as I believe no other–</p>

<p>Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,</p>

<p>Such a dependency of thing on thing,</p>

<p>As e’er I heard in madness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  O gracious duke,</p>

<p>Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason</p>

<p>For inequality, but let your reason serve</p>

<p>To make the truth appear where it seems hid,</p>

<p>And hide the false seems true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Many that are not mad</p>

<p>Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you</p>

<p>say?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>I am the sister of one Claudio,</p>

<p>Condemned upon the act of fornication</p>

<p>To lose his head, condemned by Angelo.</p>

<p>I, in probation of a sisterhood,</p>

<p>Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio</p>

<p>As then the messenger–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc> <i>[to Duke]</i>  That’s I, an ’t like your Grace.</p>

<p>I came to her from Claudio and desired her</p>

<p>To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo</p>

<p>For her poor brother’s pardon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc> <i>[to Duke]</i>  That’s he indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[to Lucio]</i></p>

<p>You were not bid to speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  No, my good lord,</p>

<p>Nor wished to hold my peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  I wish you now, then.</p>

<p>Pray you take note of it, and when you have</p>

<p>A business for yourself, pray heaven you then</p>

<p>Be perfect.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  I warrant your Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>The warrant’s for yourself. Take heed to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Right.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>It may be right, but you are i’ the wrong</p>

<p>To speak before your time.–Proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  I went</p>

<p>To this pernicious caitiff deputy–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>That’s somewhat madly spoken.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  Pardon it;</p>

<p>The phrase is to the matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Mended again. The matter; proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>In brief, to set the needless process by:</p>

<p>How I persuaded, how I prayed and kneeled,</p>

<p>How he refelled me, and how I replied–</p>

<p>For this was of much length–the vile conclusion</p>

<p>I now begin with grief and shame to utter.</p>

<p>He would not, but by gift of my chaste body</p>

<p>To his concupiscible intemperate lust,</p>

<p>Release my brother; and after much debatement,</p>

<p>My sisterly remorse confutes mine honor,</p>

<p>And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,</p>

<p>His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant</p>

<p>For my poor brother’s head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  This is most likely!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>O, that it were as like as it is true!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>By heaven, fond wretch, thou know’st not what</p>

<p>thou speak’st,</p>

<p>Or else thou art suborned against his honor</p>

<p>In hateful practice. First, his integrity</p>

<p>Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason</p>

<p>That with such vehemency he should pursue</p>

<p>Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended,</p>

<p>He would have weighed thy brother by himself</p>

<p>And not have cut him off. Someone hath set you on.</p>

<p>Confess the truth, and say by whose advice</p>

<p>Thou cam’st here to complain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  And is this all?</p>

<p>Then, O you blessed ministers above,</p>

<p>Keep me in patience, and with ripened time</p>

<p>Unfold the evil which is here wrapped up</p>

<p>In countenance. Heaven shield your Grace from</p>

<p>woe,</p>

<p>As I, thus wronged, hence unbelieved go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>I know you’d fain be gone.–An officer!</p>

<p><center><i>[An Officer comes forward.]</i></center></p>

<p>To prison with her. Shall we thus permit</p>

<p>A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall</p>

<p>On him so near us? This needs must be a practice.–</p>

<p>Who knew of your intent and coming hither?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc></p>

<p>One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.</p>

<p><center><i>[Officer exits with Isabella.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I know him. ’Tis a meddling friar.</p>

<p>I do not like the man. Had he been lay, my lord,</p>

<p>For certain words he spake against your Grace</p>

<p>In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Words against me? This’ a good friar, belike.</p>

<p>And to set on this wretched woman here</p>

<p>Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc></p>

<p>But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,</p>

<p>I saw them at the prison. A saucy friar,</p>

<p>A very scurvy fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Peter</sc> <i>[to Duke]</i>  Blessed be your royal Grace.</p>

<p>I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard</p>

<p>Your royal ear abused. First hath this woman</p>

<p>Most wrongfully accused your substitute,</p>

<p>Who is as free from touch or soil with her</p>

<p>As she from one ungot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  We did believe no less.</p>

<p>Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Peter</sc></p>

<p>I know him for a man divine and holy,</p>

<p>Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,</p>

<p>As he’s reported by this gentleman;</p>

<p>And on my trust, a man that never yet</p>

<p>Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc></p>

<p>My lord, most villainously, believe it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Peter</sc></p>

<p>Well, he in time may come to clear himself;</p>

<p>But at this instant he is sick, my lord,</p>

<p>Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,</p>

<p>Being come to knowledge that there was complaint</p>

<p>Intended ’gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither</p>

<p>To speak as from his mouth, what he doth know</p>

<p>Is true and false, and what he with his oath</p>

<p>And all probation will make up full clear</p>

<p>Whensoever he’s convented. First, for this woman,</p>

<p>To justify this worthy nobleman,</p>

<p>So vulgarly and personally accused,</p>

<p>Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes</p>

<p>Till she herself confess it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Good friar, let’s hear it.–</p>

<p>Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?</p>

<p>O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!–</p>

<p>Give us some seats.–Come, cousin Angelo,</p>

<p>In this I’ll be impartial. Be you judge</p>

<p>Of your own cause.     <i><i>[Duke and Angelo are seated.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Mariana, veiled.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Is this the witness, friar?</p>

<p>First, let her show her face, and after speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc></p>

<p>Pardon, my lord, I will not show my face</p>

<p>Until my husband bid me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  What, are you married?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  No, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Are you a maid?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  No, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  A widow, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  Neither, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Why you are nothing, then, neither maid, widow,</p>

<p>nor wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  My lord, she may be a punk, for many of them</p>

<p>are neither maid, widow, nor wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Silence that fellow. I would he had some cause</p>

<p>to prattle for himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Well, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I do confess I ne’er was married,</p>

<p>And I confess besides I am no maid.</p>

<p>I have known my husband, yet my husband</p>

<p>Knows not that ever he knew me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  He was drunk, then, my lord; it can be no better.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so</p>

<p>too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Well, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>This is no witness for Lord Angelo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  Now I come to ’t, my lord.</p>

<p>She that accuses him of fornication</p>

<p>In selfsame manner doth accuse my husband,</p>

<p>And charges him, my lord, with such a time</p>

<p>When, I’ll depose, I had him in mine arms</p>

<p>With all th’ effect of love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  Charges she more than me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  Not that I know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  No? You say your husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc></p>

<p>Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,</p>

<p>Who thinks he knows that he ne’er knew my body,</p>

<p>But knows, he thinks, that he knows Isabel’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>This is a strange abuse. Let’s see thy face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc></p>

<p>My husband bids me. Now I will unmask.</p>

<p><center><i>[She removes her veil.]</i></center></p>

<p>This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,</p>

<p>Which once thou swor’st was worth the looking on.</p>

<p>This is the hand which, with a vowed contract,</p>

<p>Was fast belocked in thine. This is the body</p>

<p>That took away the match from Isabel</p>

<p>And did supply thee at thy garden house</p>

<p>In her imagined person.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[to Angelo]</i>  Know you this woman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Carnally, she says.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Sirrah, no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Enough, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I must confess I know this woman,</p>

<p>And five years since there was some speech of</p>

<p>marriage</p>

<p>Betwixt myself and her, which was broke off,</p>

<p>Partly for that her promised proportions</p>

<p>Came short of composition, but in chief</p>

<p>For that her reputation was disvalued</p>

<p>In levity. Since which time of five years</p>

<p>I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,</p>

<p>Upon my faith and honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc> <i>[kneeling, to Duke]</i>  Noble prince,</p>

<p>As there comes light from heaven and words from</p>

<p>breath,</p>

<p>As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,</p>

<p>I am affianced this man’s wife as strongly</p>

<p>As words could make up vows. And, my good lord,</p>

<p>But Tuesday night last gone in ’s garden house</p>

<p>He knew me as a wife. As this is true,</p>

<p>Let me in safety raise me from my knees,</p>

<p>Or else forever be confixed here</p>

<p>A marble monument.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  I did but smile till now.</p>

<p>Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice.</p>

<p>My patience here is touched. I do perceive</p>

<p>These poor informal women are no more</p>

<p>But instruments of some more mightier member</p>

<p>That sets them on. Let me have way, my lord,</p>

<p>To find this practice out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Ay, with my heart,</p>

<p>And punish them to your height of pleasure.–</p>

<p>Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,</p>

<p>Compact with her that’s gone, think’st thou thy</p>

<p>oaths,</p>

<p>Though they would swear down each particular</p>

<p>saint,</p>

<p>Were testimonies against his worth and credit</p>

<p>That’s sealed in approbation?–You, Lord Escalus,</p>

<p>Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains</p>

<p>To find out this abuse, whence ’tis derived.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Duke rises. Escalus is seated.]</i></center></p>

<p>There is another friar that set them on.</p>

<p>Let him be sent for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <sc>Peter</sc></p>

<p>Would he were here, my lord, for he indeed</p>

<p>Hath set the women on to this complaint;</p>

<p>Your provost knows the place where he abides,</p>

<p>And he may fetch him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[to Provost]</i>  Go, do it instantly.</p>

<p><center><i>[Provost exits.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Angelo.]</i> And you, my noble and well-warranted</p>

<p>cousin,</p>

<p>Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,</p>

<p>Do with your injuries as seems you best</p>

<p>In any chastisement. I for a while</p>

<p>Will leave you; but stir not you till you have</p>

<p>Well determined upon these slanderers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  My lord, we’ll do it throughly.     <i><i>[Duke exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar</p>

<p>Lodowick to be a dishonest person?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Cucullus non facit monachum, honest in nothing</p>

<p>but in his clothes, and one that hath spoke most</p>

<p>villainous speeches of the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  We shall entreat you to abide here till he</p>

<p>come, and enforce them against him. We shall find</p>

<p>this friar a notable fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  As any in Vienna, on my word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Call that same Isabel here once again. I would</p>

<p>speak with her.     <i><i>[An Attendant exits.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[To Angelo.]</i> Pray you, my lord, give me leave to</p>

<p>question. You shall see how I’ll handle her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Not better than he, by her own report.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,</p>

<p>she would sooner confess; perchance publicly she’ll</p>

<p>be ashamed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  I will go darkly to work with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  That’s the way, for women are light at midnight.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Duke as a Friar, Provost, and Isabella,</p>

<p>with Officers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc> <i>[to Isabella]</i>  Come on, mistress. Here’s a gentlewoman</p>

<p>denies all that you have said.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here</p>

<p>with the Provost.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  In very good time. Speak not you to him till</p>

<p>we call upon you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Mum.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc> <i>[to disguised Duke]</i>  Come, sir, did you set</p>

<p>these women on to slander Lord Angelo? They have</p>

<p>confessed you did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>’Tis false.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  How? Know you where you are?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Respect to your great place, and let the devil</p>

<p>Be sometime honored for his burning throne.</p>

<p>Where is the Duke? ’Tis he should hear me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc></p>

<p>The Duke’s in us, and we will hear you speak.</p>

<p>Look you speak justly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Boldly, at least.–But, O, poor souls,</p>

<p>Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?</p>

<p>Good night to your redress. Is the Duke gone?</p>

<p>Then is your cause gone too. The Duke’s unjust</p>

<p>Thus to retort your manifest appeal,</p>

<p>And put your trial in the villain’s mouth</p>

<p>Which here you come to accuse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc></p>

<p>This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc> <i>[to disguised Duke]</i></p>

<p>Why, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar,</p>

<p>Is ’t not enough thou hast suborned these women</p>

<p>To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth</p>

<p>And in the witness of his proper ear,</p>

<p>To call him villain? And then to glance from him</p>

<p>To th’ Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?–</p>

<p>Take him hence. To th’ rack with him. We’ll touse</p>

<p>him</p>

<p>Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.</p>

<p>What? “Unjust”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Be not so hot. The Duke</p>

<p>Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he</p>

<p>Dare rack his own. His subject am I not,</p>

<p>Nor here provincial. My business in this state</p>

<p>Made me a looker-on here in Vienna,</p>

<p>Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble</p>

<p>Till it o’errun the stew. Laws for all faults,</p>

<p>But faults so countenanced that the strong statutes</p>

<p>Stand like the forfeits in a barber’s shop,</p>

<p>As much in mock as mark.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Slander to th’ state!</p>

<p>Away with him to prison.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc> <i>[to Lucio]</i></p>

<p>What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?</p>

<p>Is this the man that you did tell us of?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  ’Tis he, my lord.–Come hither, Goodman Baldpate.</p>

<p>Do you know me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  I remember you, sir, by the sound of</p>

<p>your voice. I met you at the prison in the absence of</p>

<p>the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  O, did you so? And do you remember what you</p>

<p>said of the Duke?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Most notedly, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger,</p>

<p>a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to</p>

<p>be?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  You must, sir, change persons with me</p>

<p>ere you make that my report. You indeed spoke so</p>

<p>of him, and much more, much worse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  O, thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by</p>

<p>the nose for thy speeches?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  I protest I love the Duke as I love</p>

<p>myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  Hark how the villain would close now, after</p>

<p>his treasonable abuses!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away</p>

<p>with him to prison. Where is the Provost? <i>[Provost</p>

<p>comes forward.]</i> Away with him to prison. Lay bolts</p>

<p>enough upon him. Let him speak no more. Away</p>

<p>with those giglets too, and with the other confederate</p>

<p>companion.</p>

<p><center><i>[Provost seizes the disguised Duke.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Stay, sir, stay awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  What, resists he?–Help him, Lucio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc> <i>[to the disguised Duke]</i>  Come, sir, come, sir,</p>

<p>come, sir. Foh, sir! Why you bald-pated, lying rascal,</p>

<p>you must be hooded, must you? Show your knave’s</p>

<p>visage, with a pox to you! Show your sheep-biting</p>

<p>face, and be hanged an hour! Will ’t not off?</p>

<p><center><i>[He pulls off the friar’s hood, and reveals the Duke.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Angelo and Escalus stand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Thou art the first knave that e’er mad’st a duke.–</p>

<p>First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.</p>

<p><i>[To Lucio.]</i> Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and</p>

<p>you</p>

<p>Must have a word anon.–Lay hold on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  This may prove worse than hanging.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[to Escalus]</i></p>

<p>What you have spoke I pardon. Sit you down.</p>

<p>We’ll borrow place of him. <i>[To Angelo.]</i> Sir, by your</p>

<p>leave.</p>

<p>Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence</p>

<p>That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,</p>

<p>Rely upon it till my tale be heard,</p>

<p>And hold no longer out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  O my dread lord,</p>

<p>I should be guiltier than my guiltiness</p>

<p>To think I can be undiscernible,</p>

<p>When I perceive your Grace, like power divine,</p>

<p>Hath looked upon my passes. Then, good prince,</p>

<p>No longer session hold upon my shame,</p>

<p>But let my trial be mine own confession.</p>

<p>Immediate sentence then and sequent death</p>

<p>Is all the grace I beg.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Come hither, Mariana.</p>

<p><center><i>[Mariana stands and comes forward.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Angelo.]</i> Say, wast thou e’er contracted to this</p>

<p>woman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc>  I was, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Go take her hence and marry her instantly.</p>

<p><i>[To Friar Peter.]</i> Do you the office, friar, which</p>

<p>consummate,</p>

<p>Return him here again.–Go with him, provost.</p>

<p><center><i>[Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter, and Provost exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonor</p>

<p>Than at the strangeness of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Come hither, Isabel.</p>

<p>Your friar is now your prince. As I was then</p>

<p>Advertising and holy to your business,</p>

<p>Not changing heart with habit, I am still</p>

<p>Attorneyed at your service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  O, give me pardon</p>

<p>That I, your vassal, have employed and pained</p>

<p>Your unknown sovereignty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  You are pardoned,</p>

<p>Isabel.</p>

<p>And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.</p>

<p>Your brother’s death, I know, sits at your heart,</p>

<p>And you may marvel why I obscured myself,</p>

<p>Laboring to save his life, and would not rather</p>

<p>Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power</p>

<p>Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,</p>

<p>It was the swift celerity of his death,</p>

<p>Which I did think with slower foot came on,</p>

<p>That brained my purpose. But peace be with him.</p>

<p>That life is better life past fearing death</p>

<p>Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,</p>

<p>So happy is your brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc>  I do, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter, and Provost.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>For this new-married man approaching here,</p>

<p>Whose salt imagination yet hath wronged</p>

<p>Your well-defended honor, you must pardon</p>

<p>For Mariana’s sake. But as he adjudged your</p>

<p>brother–</p>

<p>Being criminal in double violation</p>

<p>Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach</p>

<p>Thereon dependent for your brother’s life–</p>

<p>The very mercy of the law cries out</p>

<p>Most audible, even from his proper tongue,</p>

<p>“An Angelo for Claudio, death for death.”</p>

<p>Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;</p>

<p>Like doth quit like, and measure still for</p>

<p>measure.–</p>

<p>Then, Angelo, thy fault’s thus manifested,</p>

<p>Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee</p>

<p>vantage.</p>

<p>We do condemn thee to the very block</p>

<p>Where Claudio stooped to death, and with like</p>

<p>haste.–</p>

<p>Away with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  O my most gracious lord,</p>

<p>I hope you will not mock me with a husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>It is your husband mocked you with a husband.</p>

<p>Consenting to the safeguard of your honor,</p>

<p>I thought your marriage fit. Else imputation,</p>

<p>For that he knew you, might reproach your life</p>

<p>And choke your good to come. For his possessions,</p>

<p>Although by confiscation they are ours,</p>

<p>We do instate and widow you with all</p>

<p>To buy you a better husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  O my dear lord,</p>

<p>I crave no other nor no better man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Never crave him. We are definitive.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Gentle my liege–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  You do but lose your labor.–</p>

<p>Away with him to death. <i>[To Lucio.]</i> Now, sir, to</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc></p>

<p>O, my good lord.–Sweet Isabel, take my part.</p>

<p>Lend me your knees, and all my life to come</p>

<p>I’ll lend you all my life to do you service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Against all sense you do importune her.</p>

<p>Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,</p>

<p>Her brother’s ghost his paved bed would break</p>

<p>And take her hence in horror.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  Isabel,</p>

<p>Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me,</p>

<p>Hold up your hands, say nothing. I’ll speak all.</p>

<p>They say best men are molded out of faults,</p>

<p>And, for the most, become much more the better</p>

<p>For being a little bad. So may my husband.</p>

<p>O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>He dies for Claudio’s death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Isabella</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i>  Most bounteous sir,</p>

<p>Look, if it please you, on this man condemned</p>

<p>As if my brother lived. I partly think</p>

<p>A due sincerity governed his deeds</p>

<p>Till he did look on me. Since it is so,</p>

<p>Let him not die. My brother had but justice,</p>

<p>In that he did the thing for which he died.</p>

<p>For Angelo,</p>

<p>His act did not o’ertake his bad intent,</p>

<p>And must be buried but as an intent</p>

<p>That perished by the way. Thoughts are no subjects,</p>

<p>Intents but merely thoughts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mariana</sc>  Merely, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Your suit’s unprofitable. Stand up, I say.</p>

<p><center><i>[They stand.]</i></center></p>

<p>I have bethought me of another fault.–</p>

<p>Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded</p>

<p>At an unusual hour?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  It was commanded so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Had you a special warrant for the deed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc></p>

<p>No, my good lord, it was by private message.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>For which I do discharge you of your office.</p>

<p>Give up your keys.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  Pardon me, noble lord.</p>

<p>I thought it was a fault, but knew it not,</p>

<p>Yet did repent me after more advice,</p>

<p>For testimony whereof, one in the prison</p>

<p>That should by private order else have died,</p>

<p>I have reserved alive.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  What’s he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  His name is Barnardine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.</p>

<p>Go fetch him hither. Let me look upon him.</p>

<p><center><i>[Provost exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc> <i>[to Angelo]</i></p>

<p>I am sorry one so learned and so wise</p>

<p>As you, Lord Angelo, have still appeared,</p>

<p>Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood</p>

<p>And lack of tempered judgment afterward.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Angelo</sc></p>

<p>I am sorry that such sorrow I procure;</p>

<p>And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart</p>

<p>That I crave death more willingly than mercy.</p>

<p>’Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Barnardine and Provost, Claudio, muffled,</p>

<p>and Juliet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[to Provost]</i></p>

<p>Which is that Barnardine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  This, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>There was a friar told me of this man.–</p>

<p>Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul</p>

<p>That apprehends no further than this world,</p>

<p>And squar’st thy life according. Thou ’rt condemned.</p>

<p>But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,</p>

<p>And pray thee take this mercy to provide</p>

<p>For better times to come.–Friar, advise him.</p>

<p>I leave him to your hand.–What muffled fellow’s</p>

<p>that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc></p>

<p>This is another prisoner that I saved</p>

<p>Who should have died when Claudio lost his head,</p>

<p>As like almost to Claudio as himself.</p>

<p><center><i>[He unmuffles Claudio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[to Isabella]</i></p>

<p>If he be like your brother, for his sake</p>

<p>Is he pardoned; and for your lovely sake,</p>

<p>Give me your hand and say you will be mine,</p>

<p>He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.</p>

<p>By this Lord Angelo perceives he’s safe;</p>

<p>Methinks I see a quick’ning in his eye.–</p>

<p>Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well.</p>

<p>Look that you love your wife, her worth worth</p>

<p>yours.</p>

<p>I find an apt remission in myself.</p>

<p>And yet here’s one in place I cannot pardon.</p>

<p><i>[To Lucio.]</i> You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a</p>

<p>coward,</p>

<p>One all of luxury, an ass, a madman.</p>

<p>Wherein have I so deserved of you</p>

<p>That you extol me thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the</p>

<p>trick. If you will hang me for it, you may, but I had</p>

<p>rather it would please you I might be whipped.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Whipped first, sir, and hanged after.–</p>

<p>Proclaim it, provost, round about the city,</p>

<p>If any woman wronged by this lewd fellow–</p>

<p>As I have heard him swear himself there’s one</p>

<p>Whom he begot with child–let her appear,</p>

<p>And he shall marry her. The nuptial finished,</p>

<p>Let him be whipped and hanged.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  I beseech your Highness do not marry me to a</p>

<p>whore. Your Highness said even now I made you a</p>

<p>duke. Good my lord, do not recompense me in</p>

<p>making me a cuckold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Upon mine honor, thou shalt marry her.</p>

<p>Thy slanders I forgive and therewithal</p>

<p>Remit thy other forfeits.–Take him to prison,</p>

<p>And see our pleasure herein executed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,</p>

<p>whipping, and hanging.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Slandering a prince deserves it.</p>

<p><center><i>[Officers take Lucio away.]</i></center></p>

<p>She, Claudio, that you wronged, look you restore.–</p>

<p>Joy to you, Mariana.–Love her, Angelo.</p>

<p>I have confessed her, and I know her virtue.–</p>

<p>Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness.</p>

<p>There’s more behind that is more gratulate.–</p>

<p>Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy.</p>

<p>We shall employ thee in a worthier place.–</p>

<p>Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home</p>

<p>The head of Ragozine for Claudio’s.</p>

<p>Th’ offense pardons itself.–Dear Isabel,</p>

<p>I have a motion much imports your good,</p>

<p>Whereto if you’ll a willing ear incline,</p>

<p>What’s mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.–</p>

<p>So, bring us to our palace, where we’ll show</p>

<p>What’s yet behind that’s meet you all should know.</p>
