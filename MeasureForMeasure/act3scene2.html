<p><center><i>[Enter Elbow, Pompey, and Officers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc> <i>[to Pompey]</i>  Nay, if there be no remedy for it</p>

<p>but that you will needs buy and sell men and</p>

<p>women like beasts, we shall have all the world drink</p>

<p>brown and white bastard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar, aside]</i>  O heavens, what stuff is here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  ’Twas never merry world since, of two usuries,</p>

<p>the merriest was put down, and the worser allowed</p>

<p>by order of law a furred gown to keep him warm,</p>

<p>and furred with fox and lambskins too, to signify</p>

<p>that craft, being richer than innocency, stands for</p>

<p>the facing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  Come your way, sir.–Bless you, good father</p>

<p>friar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  And you, good brother father. What</p>

<p>offense hath this man made you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir,</p>

<p>we take him to be a thief too, sir, for we have found</p>

<p>upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have</p>

<p>sent to the Deputy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar, to Pompey]</i></p>

<p>Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!</p>

<p>The evil that thou causest to be done,</p>

<p>That is thy means to live. Do thou but think</p>

<p>What ’tis to cram a maw or clothe a back</p>

<p>From such a filthy vice; say to thyself,</p>

<p>From their abominable and beastly touches</p>

<p>I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.</p>

<p>Canst thou believe thy living is a life,</p>

<p>So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir. But yet,</p>

<p>sir, I would prove–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,</p>

<p>Thou wilt prove his.–Take him to prison, officer.</p>

<p>Correction and instruction must both work</p>

<p>Ere this rude beast will profit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  He must before the Deputy, sir; he has given</p>

<p>him warning. The Deputy cannot abide a whoremaster.</p>

<p>If he be a whoremonger and comes before</p>

<p>him, he were as good go a mile on his errand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>That we were all, as some would seem to be,</p>

<p>From our faults, as faults from seeming, free.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  His neck will come to your waist–a cord, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lucio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  I spy comfort, I cry bail. Here’s a gentleman</p>

<p>and a friend of mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  How now, noble Pompey? What, at the wheels of</p>

<p>Caesar? Art thou led in triumph? What, is there</p>

<p>none of Pygmalion’s images, newly made woman,</p>

<p>to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket</p>

<p>and extracting it clutched? What reply, ha? What</p>

<p>sayst thou to this tune, matter, and method? Is ’t not</p>

<p>drowned i’ th’ last rain, ha? What sayst thou, trot? Is</p>

<p>the world as it was, man? Which is the way? Is it sad</p>

<p>and few words? Or how? The trick of it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar, aside]</i>  Still thus, and thus; still worse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc> <i>[to Pompey]</i>  How doth my dear morsel, thy</p>

<p>mistress? Procures she still, ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and</p>

<p>she is herself in the tub.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Why, ’tis good. It is the right of it. It must be so.</p>

<p>Ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd, an</p>

<p>unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going to</p>

<p>prison, Pompey?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  Yes, faith, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Why, ’tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell. Go say I</p>

<p>sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? Or how?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc>  For being a bawd, for being a bawd.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be</p>

<p>the due of a bawd, why, ’tis his right. Bawd is he,</p>

<p>doubtless, and of antiquity too. Bawd born.–</p>

<p>Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,</p>

<p>Pompey. You will turn good husband now,</p>

<p>Pompey; you will keep the house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc>  I hope, sir, your good Worship will be my bail.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the</p>

<p>wear. I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage.</p>

<p>If you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is</p>

<p>the more. Adieu, trusty Pompey.–Bless you, friar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  And you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc> <i>[to Pompey]</i>  Does Bridget paint still, Pompey,</p>

<p>ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc> <i>[to Pompey]</i>  Come your ways, sir, come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pompey</sc> <i>[to Lucio]</i>  You will not bail me, then, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Then, Pompey, nor now.–What news abroad,</p>

<p>friar? What news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Elbow</sc> <i>[to Pompey]</i>  Come your ways, sir, come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Go to kennel, Pompey, go.</p>

<p><center><i>[Elbow, Pompey, and Officers exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>What news, friar, of the Duke?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  I know none. Can you tell me of any?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia;</p>

<p>other some, he is in Rome. But where is he, think</p>

<p>you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  I know not where, but wheresoever, I</p>

<p>wish him well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal</p>

<p>from the state and usurp the beggary he was never</p>

<p>born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence.</p>

<p>He puts transgression to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  He does well in ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm</p>

<p>in him. Something too crabbed that way, friar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  It is too general a vice, and severity</p>

<p>must cure it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;</p>

<p>it is well allied, but it is impossible to extirp it quite,</p>

<p>friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say</p>

<p>this Angelo was not made by man and woman after</p>

<p>this downright way of creation. Is it true, think</p>

<p>you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  How should he be made, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some,</p>

<p>that he was begot between two stockfishes. But it is</p>

<p>certain that when he makes water, his urine is</p>

<p>congealed ice; that I know to be true. And he is a</p>

<p>motion generative, that’s infallible.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the</p>

<p>rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a</p>

<p>man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?</p>

<p>Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting</p>

<p>a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the</p>

<p>nursing a thousand. He had some feeling of the</p>

<p>sport, he knew the service, and that instructed him</p>

<p>to mercy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  I never heard the absent duke much</p>

<p>detected for women. He was not inclined that way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  O, sir, you are deceived.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  ’Tis not possible.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Who, not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty;</p>

<p>and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The</p>

<p>Duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too,</p>

<p>that let me inform you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  You do him wrong, surely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the</p>

<p>Duke, and I believe I know the cause of his</p>

<p>withdrawing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  What, I prithee, might be the cause?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  No, pardon. ’Tis a secret must be locked within</p>

<p>the teeth and the lips. But this I can let you</p>

<p>understand: the greater file of the subject held the</p>

<p>Duke to be wise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Wise? Why, no question but he was.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Either this is envy in you, folly, or</p>

<p>mistaking. The very stream of his life and the</p>

<p>business he hath helmed must, upon a warranted</p>

<p>need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be</p>

<p>but testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he</p>

<p>shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman,</p>

<p>and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskillfully. Or,</p>

<p>if your knowledge be more, it is much darkened in</p>

<p>your malice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Sir, I know him, and I love him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Love talks with better knowledge, and</p>

<p>knowledge with dearer love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Come, sir, I know what I know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  I can hardly believe that, since you</p>

<p>know not what you speak. But if ever the Duke</p>

<p>return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you</p>

<p>to make your answer before him. If it be honest you</p>

<p>have spoke, you have courage to maintain it. I am</p>

<p>bound to call upon you, and, I pray you, your name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  He shall know you better, sir, if I may</p>

<p>live to report you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  I fear you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  O, you hope the Duke will return no</p>

<p>more, or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite.</p>

<p>But indeed I can do you little harm; you’ll</p>

<p>forswear this again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  I’ll be hanged first. Thou art deceived in me,</p>

<p>friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio</p>

<p>die tomorrow or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Why should he die, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lucio</sc>  Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would</p>

<p>the Duke we talk of were returned again. This</p>

<p>ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with</p>

<p>continency. Sparrows must not build in his house</p>

<p>eaves, because they are lecherous. The Duke yet</p>

<p>would have dark deeds darkly answered. He would</p>

<p>never bring them to light Would he were returned.</p>

<p>Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.</p>

<p>Farewell, good friar. I prithee pray for me. The</p>

<p>Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on</p>

<p>Fridays. He’s now past it, yet–and I say to thee–</p>

<p>he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt</p>

<p>brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>No might nor greatness in mortality</p>

<p>Can censure scape. Back-wounding calumny</p>

<p>The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong</p>

<p>Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?</p>

<p>But who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Escalus, Provost, Officers, and Mistress</p>

<p>Overdone, a Bawd.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc> <i>[to Officers]</i>  Go, away with her to prison.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bawd</sc>  Good my lord, be good to me. Your Honor is</p>

<p>accounted a merciful man, good my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit</p>

<p>in the same kind? This would make mercy</p>

<p>swear and play the tyrant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  A bawd of eleven years’ continuance, may it</p>

<p>please your Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bawd</sc> <i>[to Escalus]</i>  My lord, this is one Lucio’s information</p>

<p>against me. Mistress Kate Keepdown was</p>

<p>with child by him in the Duke’s time; he promised</p>

<p>her marriage. His child is a year and a quarter old</p>

<p>come Philip and Jacob. I have kept it myself, and see</p>

<p>how he goes about to abuse me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  That fellow is a fellow of much license. Let</p>

<p>him be called before us. Away with her to prison.–</p>

<p>Go to, no more words.     <i><i>[Officers exit with Bawd.]</i></i></p>

<p>Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered.</p>

<p>Claudio must die tomorrow. Let him be furnished</p>

<p>with divines and have all charitable preparation. If</p>

<p>my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be so</p>

<p>with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Provost</sc>  So please you, this friar hath been with him,</p>

<p>and advised him for th’ entertainment of death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Good even, good father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Bliss and goodness on you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Of whence are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i></p>

<p>Not of this country, though my chance is now</p>

<p>To use it for my time. I am a brother</p>

<p>Of gracious order, late come from the See</p>

<p>In special business from his Holiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  What news abroad i’ th’ world?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  None but that there is so great a fever</p>

<p>on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it.</p>

<p>Novelty is only in request, and it is as dangerous to</p>

<p>be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be</p>

<p>constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth</p>

<p>enough alive to make societies secure, but security</p>

<p>enough to make fellowships accursed. Much upon</p>

<p>this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news</p>

<p>is old enough, yet it is every day’s news. I pray you,</p>

<p>sir, of what disposition was the Duke?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  One that, above all other strifes, contended</p>

<p>especially to know himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  What pleasure was he given to?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  Rather rejoicing to see another merry than</p>

<p>merry at anything which professed to make him</p>

<p>rejoice–a gentleman of all temperance. But leave</p>

<p>we him to his events, with a prayer they may prove</p>

<p>prosperous, and let me desire to know how you find</p>

<p>Claudio prepared. I am made to understand that</p>

<p>you have lent him visitation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  He professes to have received no</p>

<p>sinister measure from his judge but most willingly</p>

<p>humbles himself to the determination of justice. Yet</p>

<p>had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his</p>

<p>frailty, many deceiving promises of life, which I, by</p>

<p>my good leisure, have discredited to him, and now</p>

<p>is he resolved to die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  You have paid the heavens your function and</p>

<p>the prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have</p>

<p>labored for the poor gentleman to the extremest</p>

<p>shore of my modesty, but my brother justice have I</p>

<p>found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him</p>

<p>he is indeed Justice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  If his own life answer the straitness of</p>

<p>his proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if</p>

<p>he chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Escalus</sc>  I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[as Friar]</i>  Peace be with you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Escalus and Provost exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>He who the sword of heaven will bear</p>

<p>Should be as holy as severe,</p>

<p>Pattern in himself to know,</p>

<p>Grace to stand, and virtue go;</p>

<p>More nor less to others paying</p>

<p>Than by self-offenses weighing.</p>

<p>Shame to him whose cruel striking</p>

<p>Kills for faults of his own liking.</p>

<p>Twice treble shame on Angelo,</p>

<p>To weed my vice, and let his grow.</p>

<p>O, what may man within him hide,</p>

<p>Though angel on the outward side!</p>

<p>How may likeness made in crimes,</p>

<p>Making practice on the times,</p>

<p>To draw with idle spiders’ strings</p>

<p>Most ponderous and substantial things.</p>

<p>Craft against vice I must apply.</p>

<p>With Angelo tonight shall lie</p>

<p>His old betrothed but despised.</p>

<p>So disguise shall, by th’ disguised,</p>

<p>Pay with falsehood false exacting</p>

<p>And perform an old contracting.</p>
