<p><center><i>[Enter Bevis and John Holland with staves.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bevis</sc>  Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a</p>

<p>lath. They have been up these two days.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holland</sc>  They have the more need to sleep now, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bevis</sc>  I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress</p>

<p>the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap</p>

<p>upon it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holland</sc>  So he had need, for ’tis threadbare. Well, I</p>

<p>say, it was never merry world in England since</p>

<p>gentlemen came up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bevis</sc>  O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in</p>

<p>handicraftsmen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holland</sc>  The nobility think scorn to go in leather</p>

<p>aprons.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bevis</sc>  Nay, more, the King’s Council are no good</p>

<p>workmen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holland</sc>  True, and yet it is said “Labor in thy vocation,”</p>

<p>which is as much to say as “Let the magistrates</p>

<p>be laboring men.” And therefore should we</p>

<p>be magistrates.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bevis</sc>  Thou hast hit it, for there’s no better sign of a</p>

<p>brave mind than a hard hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holland</sc>  I see them, I see them! There’s Best’s son, the</p>

<p>tanner of Wingham–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bevis</sc>  He shall have the skins of our enemies to make</p>

<p>dog’s leather of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holland</sc>  And Dick the butcher–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bevis</sc>  Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity’s</p>

<p>throat cut like a calf.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holland</sc>  And Smith the weaver.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bevis</sc>  Argo, their thread of life is spun.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holland</sc>  Come, come, let’s fall in with them.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Drum. Enter Cade, Dick the butcher, Smith the</p>

<p>weaver, and a Sawyer, with infinite numbers,</p>

<p>all with staves.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  We, John Cade, so termed of our supposed</p>

<p>father–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Or rather of stealing a cade of herrings.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired</p>

<p>with the spirit of putting down kings and princes–</p>

<p>command silence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc>  Silence!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  My father was a Mortimer–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He was an honest man and a good</p>

<p>bricklayer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  My mother a Plantagenet–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  I knew her well; she was a midwife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  My wife descended of the Lacys.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  She was indeed a peddler’s daughter, and</p>

<p>sold many laces.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Smith</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  But now of late, not able to travel with</p>

<p>her furred pack, she washes bucks here at home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Therefore am I of an honorable house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Ay, by my faith, the field is honorable;</p>

<p>and there was he born, under a hedge, for his</p>

<p>father had never a house but the cage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Valiant I am–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Smith</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He must needs, for beggary is valiant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  I am able to endure much–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  No question of that; for I have seen him</p>

<p>whipped three market-days together.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  I fear neither sword nor fire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Smith</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He need not fear the sword, for his coat</p>

<p>is of proof.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  But methinks he should stand in fear of</p>

<p>fire, being burnt i’ th’ hand for stealing of sheep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Be brave, then, for your captain is brave and</p>

<p>vows reformation. There shall be in England seven</p>

<p>halfpenny loaves sold for a penny. The three-hooped</p>

<p>pot shall have ten hoops, and I will make it</p>

<p>felony to drink small beer. All the realm shall be in</p>

<p>common, and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to</p>

<p>grass. And when I am king, as king I will be–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  God save your Majesty!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  I thank you, good people.–There shall be no</p>

<p>money; all shall eat and drink on my score; and I</p>

<p>will apparel them all in one livery, that they may</p>

<p>agree like brothers and worship me their lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc>  The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable</p>

<p>thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should</p>

<p>be made parchment? That parchment, being scribbled</p>

<p>o’er, should undo a man? Some say the bee</p>

<p>stings, but I say, ’tis the beeswax; for I did but seal</p>

<p>once to a thing, and I was never mine own man</p>

<p>since. How now? Who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Clerk of Chartham, under guard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Smith</sc>  The clerk of Chartham. He can write and read</p>

<p>and cast account.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  O, monstrous!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Smith</sc>  We took him setting of boys’ copies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Here’s a villain!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Smith</sc>  H’as a book in his pocket with red letters in ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Nay, then, he is a conjurer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc>  Nay, he can make obligations and write court</p>

<p>hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  I am sorry for ’t. The man is a proper man, of</p>

<p>mine honor. Unless I find him guilty, he shall not</p>

<p>die.–Come hither, sirrah; I must examine thee.</p>

<p>What is thy name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clerk</sc>  Emmanuel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc>  They use to write it on the top of letters.–’Twill</p>

<p>go hard with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Let me alone.–Dost thou use to write thy</p>

<p>name? Or hast thou a mark to thyself, like an</p>

<p>honest, plain-dealing man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clerk</sc>  Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought</p>

<p>up that I can write my name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  He hath confessed. Away with him! He’s a villain</p>

<p>and a traitor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Away with him, I say! Hang him with his pen</p>

<p>and inkhorn about his neck.</p>

<p><center><i>[One exits with the Clerk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Michael.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Michael</sc>  Where’s our general?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Here I am, thou particular fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Michael</sc>  Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his</p>

<p>brother are hard by, with the King’s forces.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Stand, villain, stand, or I’ll fell thee down. He</p>

<p>shall be encountered with a man as good as himself.</p>

<p>He is but a knight, is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Michael</sc>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  To equal him I will make myself a knight</p>

<p>presently. <i>[He kneels.]</i> Rise up Sir John Mortimer.</p>

<p><i>[He rises.]</i> Now have at him!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir Humphrey Stafford and his Brother, with</p>

<p>a Herald, Drum, and Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stafford</sc></p>

<p>Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,</p>

<p>Marked for the gallows, lay your weapons down!</p>

<p>Home to your cottages; forsake this groom.</p>

<p>The King is merciful, if you revolt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,</p>

<p>If you go forward. Therefore yield, or die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc></p>

<p>As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not.</p>

<p>It is to you, good people, that I speak,</p>

<p>Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign,</p>

<p>For I am rightful heir unto the crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stafford</sc></p>

<p>Villain, thy father was a plasterer,</p>

<p>And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc></p>

<p>And Adam was a gardener.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brother</sc>  And what of that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc></p>

<p>Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March,</p>

<p>Married the Duke of Clarence’ daughter, did he not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stafford</sc>  Ay, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc></p>

<p>By her he had two children at one birth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brother</sc>  That’s false.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc></p>

<p>Ay, there’s the question. But I say ’tis true.</p>

<p>The elder of them, being put to nurse,</p>

<p>Was by a beggar-woman stol’n away,</p>

<p>And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,</p>

<p>Became a bricklayer when he came to age.</p>

<p>His son am I. Deny it if you can.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc></p>

<p>Nay, ’tis too true. Therefore he shall be king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Smith</sc>  Sir, he made a chimney in my father’s house,</p>

<p>and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it.</p>

<p>Therefore deny it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stafford</sc></p>

<p>And will you credit this base drudge’s words,</p>

<p>That speaks he knows not what?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc></p>

<p>Ay, marry, will we. Therefore get you gone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  He lies, <i>[aside]</i> for I invented it myself.–Go to,</p>

<p>sirrah. Tell the King from me that, for his father’s</p>

<p>sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boys went to</p>

<p>span-counter for French crowns, I am content he</p>

<p>shall reign, but I’ll be Protector over him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc>  And, furthermore, we’ll have the Lord Saye’s</p>

<p>head for selling the dukedom of Maine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  And good reason: for thereby is England mained</p>

<p>and fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance</p>

<p>holds it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord</p>

<p>Saye hath gelded the commonwealth and made it</p>

<p>an eunuch; and, more than that, he can speak</p>

<p>French, and therefore he is a traitor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stafford</sc></p>

<p>O, gross and miserable ignorance!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Nay, answer if you can. The Frenchmen are our</p>

<p>enemies. Go to, then, I ask but this: can he that</p>

<p>speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good</p>

<p>counselor, or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  No, no, and therefore we’ll have his head!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brother</sc> <i>[to Stafford]</i></p>

<p>Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,</p>

<p>Assail them with the army of the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stafford</sc></p>

<p>Herald, away, and throughout every town</p>

<p>Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade,</p>

<p>That those which fly before the battle ends</p>

<p>May, even in their wives’ and children’s sight</p>

<p>Be hanged up for example at their doors.–</p>

<p>And you that be the King’s friends, follow me.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Staffords, Soldiers, and Herald exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc></p>

<p>And you that love the Commons, follow me.</p>

<p>Now show yourselves men. ’Tis for liberty!</p>

<p>We will not leave one lord, one gentleman;</p>

<p>Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon,</p>

<p>For they are thrifty, honest men and such</p>

<p>As would, but that they dare not, take our parts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc>  They are all in order and march toward us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  But then are we in order when we are most out</p>

<p>of order. Come, march forward.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
