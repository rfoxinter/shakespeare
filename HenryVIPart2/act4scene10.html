<p><center><i>[Enter Cade.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Fie on ambitions! Fie on myself, that have a</p>

<p>sword and yet am ready to famish! These five days</p>

<p>have I hid me in these woods and durst not peep</p>

<p>out, for all the country is laid for me. But now am</p>

<p>I so hungry that, if I might have a lease of my life</p>

<p>for a thousand years, I could stay no longer.</p>

<p>Wherefore, o’er a brick wall have I climbed into</p>

<p>this garden, to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet</p>

<p>another while, which is not amiss to cool a man’s</p>

<p>stomach this hot weather. And I think this word</p>

<p>sallet was born to do me good; for many a time,</p>

<p>but for a sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a</p>

<p>brown bill; and many a time, when I have been dry</p>

<p>and bravely marching, it hath served me instead of</p>

<p>a quart pot to drink in; and now the word sallet</p>

<p>must serve me to feed on.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Iden and his Men.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iden</sc></p>

<p>Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court</p>

<p>And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?</p>

<p>This small inheritance my father left me</p>

<p>Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.</p>

<p>I seek not to wax great by others’ waning,</p>

<p>Or gather wealth, I care not with what envy.</p>

<p>Sufficeth that I have maintains my state</p>

<p>And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Here’s the lord of the soil come to seize</p>

<p>me for a stray, for entering his fee-simple without</p>

<p>leave.–Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me and get a</p>

<p>thousand crowns of the King by carrying my head</p>

<p>to him; but I’ll make thee eat iron like an ostrich</p>

<p>and swallow my sword like a great pin, ere thou</p>

<p>and I part.     <i><i>[He draws his sword.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iden</sc></p>

<p>Why, rude companion, whatsoe’er thou be,</p>

<p>I know thee not. Why, then, should I betray thee?</p>

<p>Is ’t not enough to break into my garden</p>

<p>And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,</p>

<p>Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,</p>

<p>But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Brave thee? Ay, by the best blood that ever was</p>

<p>broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I</p>

<p>have eat no meat these five days, yet come thou</p>

<p>and thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as</p>

<p>dead as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat</p>

<p>grass more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iden</sc></p>

<p>Nay, it shall ne’er be said, while England stands,</p>

<p>That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,</p>

<p>Took odds to combat a poor famished man.</p>

<p>Oppose thy steadfast gazing eyes to mine;</p>

<p>See if thou canst outface me with thy looks.</p>

<p>Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;</p>

<p>Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,</p>

<p>Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon.</p>

<p>My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;</p>

<p>And if mine arm be heaved in the air,</p>

<p>Thy grave is digged already in the earth.</p>

<p>As for words, whose greatness answers words,</p>

<p>Let this my sword report what speech forbears.</p>

<p><center><i>[He draws his sword.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  By my valor, the most complete champion that</p>

<p>ever I heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge or cut not</p>

<p>out the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere</p>

<p>thou sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my</p>

<p>knees thou mayst be turned to hobnails.</p>

<p><center><i>[Here they fight, and Cade falls.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, I am slain! Famine, and no other, hath slain me.</p>

<p>Let ten thousand devils come against me, and give</p>

<p>me but the ten meals I have lost, and I’d defy them</p>

<p>all. Wither, garden, and be henceforth a burying</p>

<p>place to all that do dwell in this house, because the</p>

<p>unconquered soul of Cade is fled.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iden</sc></p>

<p>Is ’t Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?</p>

<p>Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deed,</p>

<p>And hang thee o’er my tomb when I am dead.</p>

<p>Ne’er shall this blood be wiped from thy point,</p>

<p>But thou shalt wear it as a herald’s coat</p>

<p>To emblaze the honor that thy master got.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell</p>

<p>Kent from me she hath lost her best man, and</p>

<p>exhort all the world to be cowards; for I, that never</p>

<p>feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valor.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iden</sc></p>

<p>How much thou wrong’st me, heaven be my judge!</p>

<p>Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee!</p>

<p>And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,</p>

<p>So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.</p>

<p>Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels</p>

<p>Unto a dunghill, which shall be thy grave,</p>

<p>And there cut off thy most ungracious head,</p>

<p>Which I will bear in triumph to the King,</p>

<p>Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with his Men, dragging Cade’s body.]</i></center></p>
