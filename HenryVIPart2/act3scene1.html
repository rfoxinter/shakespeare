<p><center><i>[Sound a sennet. Enter King Henry, Queen Margaret,</p>

<p>Cardinal, Suffolk, York, Buckingham, Salisbury, and</p>

<p>Warwick, and Others to the Parliament.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>I muse my lord of Gloucester is not come.</p>

<p>’Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,</p>

<p>Whate’er occasion keeps him from us now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Can you not see, or will you not observe,</p>

<p>The strangeness of his altered countenance?</p>

<p>With what a majesty he bears himself,</p>

<p>How insolent of late he is become,</p>

<p>How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?</p>

<p>We know the time since he was mild and affable;</p>

<p>And if we did but glance a far-off look,</p>

<p>Immediately he was upon his knee,</p>

<p>That all the court admired him for submission.</p>

<p>But meet him now, and, be it in the morn</p>

<p>When everyone will give the time of day,</p>

<p>He knits his brow and shows an angry eye</p>

<p>And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,</p>

<p>Disdaining duty that to us belongs.</p>

<p>Small curs are not regarded when they grin,</p>

<p>But great men tremble when the lion roars–</p>

<p>And Humphrey is no little man in England.</p>

<p>First, note that he is near you in descent,</p>

<p>And, should you fall, he is the next will mount.</p>

<p>Meseemeth then it is no policy,</p>

<p>Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears</p>

<p>And his advantage following your decease,</p>

<p>That he should come about your royal person</p>

<p>Or be admitted to your Highness’ Council.</p>

<p>By flattery hath he won the Commons’ hearts;</p>

<p>And when he please to make commotion,</p>

<p>’Tis to be feared they all will follow him.</p>

<p>Now ’tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;</p>

<p>Suffer them now, and they’ll o’ergrow the garden</p>

<p>And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.</p>

<p>The reverent care I bear unto my lord</p>

<p>Made me collect these dangers in the Duke.</p>

<p>If it be fond, call it a woman’s fear,</p>

<p>Which fear, if better reasons can supplant,</p>

<p>I will subscribe and say I wronged the Duke.</p>

<p>My lords of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,</p>

<p>Reprove my allegation if you can,</p>

<p>Or else conclude my words effectual.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Well hath your Highness seen into this duke,</p>

<p>And, had I first been put to speak my mind,</p>

<p>I think I should have told your Grace’s tale.</p>

<p>The Duchess by his subornation,</p>

<p>Upon my life, began her devilish practices;</p>

<p>Or if he were not privy to those faults,</p>

<p>Yet, by reputing of his high descent–</p>

<p>As next the King he was successive heir,</p>

<p>And such high vaunts of his nobility–</p>

<p>Did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess</p>

<p>By wicked means to frame our sovereign’s fall.</p>

<p>Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,</p>

<p>And in his simple show he harbors treason.</p>

<p>The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.</p>

<p>No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man</p>

<p>Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>Did he not, contrary to form of law,</p>

<p>Devise strange deaths for small offenses done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>And did he not, in his protectorship,</p>

<p>Levy great sums of money through the realm</p>

<p>For soldiers’ pay in France, and never sent it,</p>

<p>By means whereof the towns each day revolted?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown,</p>

<p>Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke</p>

<p>Humphrey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>My lords, at once: the care you have of us</p>

<p>To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot</p>

<p>Is worthy praise; but, shall I speak my conscience,</p>

<p>Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent</p>

<p>From meaning treason to our royal person</p>

<p>As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove.</p>

<p>The Duke is virtuous, mild, and too well given</p>

<p>To dream on evil or to work my downfall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Ah, what’s more dangerous than this fond affiance?</p>

<p>Seems he a dove? His feathers are but borrowed,</p>

<p>For he’s disposed as the hateful raven.</p>

<p>Is he a lamb? His skin is surely lent him,</p>

<p>For he’s inclined as is the ravenous wolves.</p>

<p>Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?</p>

<p>Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all</p>

<p>Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Somerset.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Somerset</sc></p>

<p>All health unto my gracious sovereign!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Somerset</sc></p>

<p>That all your interest in those territories</p>

<p>Is utterly bereft you. All is lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God’s will be done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Cold news for me, for I had hope of France</p>

<p>As firmly as I hope for fertile England.</p>

<p>Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud,</p>

<p>And caterpillars eat my leaves away.</p>

<p>But I will remedy this gear ere long,</p>

<p>Or sell my title for a glorious grave.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>All happiness unto my lord the King!</p>

<p>Pardon, my liege, that I have stayed so long.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,</p>

<p>Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art.</p>

<p>I do arrest thee of high treason here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush</p>

<p>Nor change my countenance for this arrest.</p>

<p>A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.</p>

<p>The purest spring is not so free from mud</p>

<p>As I am clear from treason to my sovereign.</p>

<p>Who can accuse me? Wherein am I guilty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>’Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France</p>

<p>And, being Protector, stayed the soldiers’ pay,</p>

<p>By means whereof his Highness hath lost France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Is it but thought so? What are they that think it?</p>

<p>I never robbed the soldiers of their pay</p>

<p>Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.</p>

<p>So help me God as I have watched the night–</p>

<p>Ay, night by night–in studying good for England!</p>

<p>That doit that e’er I wrested from the King,</p>

<p>Or any groat I hoarded to my use,</p>

<p>Be brought against me at my trial day!</p>

<p>No, many a pound of mine own proper store,</p>

<p>Because I would not tax the needy Commons,</p>

<p>Have I dispursed to the garrisons</p>

<p>And never asked for restitution.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>I say no more than truth, so help me God.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>In your protectorship, you did devise</p>

<p>Strange tortures for offenders, never heard of,</p>

<p>That England was defamed by tyranny.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Why, ’tis well known that whiles I was Protector,</p>

<p>Pity was all the fault that was in me;</p>

<p>For I should melt at an offender’s tears,</p>

<p>And lowly words were ransom for their fault.</p>

<p>Unless it were a bloody murderer</p>

<p>Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,</p>

<p>I never gave them condign punishment.</p>

<p>Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured</p>

<p>Above the felon or what trespass else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered;</p>

<p>But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge</p>

<p>Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.</p>

<p>I do arrest you in his Highness’ name,</p>

<p>And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal</p>

<p>To keep until your further time of trial.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>My lord of Gloucester, ’tis my special hope</p>

<p>That you will clear yourself from all suspense.</p>

<p>My conscience tells me you are innocent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous.</p>

<p>Virtue is choked with foul ambition,</p>

<p>And charity chased hence by rancor’s hand;</p>

<p>Foul subornation is predominant,</p>

<p>And equity exiled your Highness’ land.</p>

<p>I know their complot is to have my life;</p>

<p>And if my death might make this island happy</p>

<p>And prove the period of their tyranny,</p>

<p>I would expend it with all willingness.</p>

<p>But mine is made the prologue to their play;</p>

<p>For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,</p>

<p>Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.</p>

<p>Beaufort’s red sparkling eyes blab his heart’s malice,</p>

<p>And Suffolk’s cloudy brow his stormy hate;</p>

<p>Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue</p>

<p>The envious load that lies upon his heart;</p>

<p>And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,</p>

<p>Whose overweening arm I have plucked back,</p>

<p>By false accuse doth level at my life.–</p>

<p>And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,</p>

<p>Causeless have laid disgraces on my head</p>

<p>And with your best endeavor have stirred up</p>

<p>My liefest liege to be mine enemy.</p>

<p>Ay, all of you have laid your heads together–</p>

<p>Myself had notice of your conventicles–</p>

<p>And all to make away my guiltless life.</p>

<p>I shall not want false witness to condemn me</p>

<p>Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt.</p>

<p>The ancient proverb will be well effected:</p>

<p>“A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>My liege, his railing is intolerable.</p>

<p>If those that care to keep your royal person</p>

<p>From treason’s secret knife and traitor’s rage</p>

<p>Be thus upbraided, chid, and rated at,</p>

<p>And the offender granted scope of speech,</p>

<p>’Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here</p>

<p>With ignominious words, though clerkly couched,</p>

<p>As if she had suborned some to swear</p>

<p>False allegations to o’erthrow his state?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>But I can give the loser leave to chide.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Far truer spoke than meant. I lose, indeed;</p>

<p>Beshrew the winners, for they played me false!</p>

<p>And well such losers may have leave to speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>He’ll wrest the sense and hold us here all day.</p>

<p>Lord Cardinal, he is your prisoner.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc> <i>[to his Men]</i></p>

<p>Sirs, take away the Duke, and guard him sure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Ah, thus King Henry throws away his crutch</p>

<p>Before his legs be firm to bear his body.–</p>

<p>Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,</p>

<p>And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.</p>

<p>Ah, that my fear were false; ah, that it were!</p>

<p>For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gloucester exits, guarded by Cardinal’s Men.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best</p>

<p>Do, or undo, as if ourself were here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>What, will your Highness leave the Parliament?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Ay, Margaret. My heart is drowned with grief,</p>

<p>Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,</p>

<p>My body round engirt with misery;</p>

<p>For what’s more miserable than discontent?</p>

<p>Ah, uncle Humphrey, in thy face I see</p>

<p>The map of honor, truth, and loyalty;</p>

<p>And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come</p>

<p>That e’er I proved thee false or feared thy faith.</p>

<p>What louring star now envies thy estate</p>

<p>That these great lords and Margaret our queen</p>

<p>Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?</p>

<p>Thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong.</p>

<p>And as the butcher takes away the calf</p>

<p>And binds the wretch and beats it when it strains,</p>

<p>Bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse,</p>

<p>Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;</p>

<p>And as the dam runs lowing up and down,</p>

<p>Looking the way her harmless young one went,</p>

<p>And can do naught but wail her darling’s loss,</p>

<p>Even so myself bewails good Gloucester’s case</p>

<p>With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimmed eyes</p>

<p>Look after him and cannot do him good,</p>

<p>So mighty are his vowed enemies.</p>

<p>His fortunes I will weep and, ’twixt each groan,</p>

<p>Say “Who’s a traitor, Gloucester he is none.”</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits, with Buckingham, Salisbury, Warwick,</p>

<p>and Others. Somerset steps aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[to Cardinal, Suffolk, and York]</i></p>

<p>Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun’s hot</p>

<p>beams.</p>

<p>Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,</p>

<p>Too full of foolish pity; and Gloucester’s show</p>

<p>Beguiles him, as the mournful crocodile</p>

<p>With sorrow snares relenting passengers,</p>

<p>Or as the snake, rolled in a flow’ring bank,</p>

<p>With shining checkered slough, doth sting a child</p>

<p>That for the beauty thinks it excellent.</p>

<p>Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I–</p>

<p>And yet herein I judge mine own wit good–</p>

<p>This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,</p>

<p>To rid us from the fear we have of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>That he should die is worthy policy,</p>

<p>But yet we want a color for his death.</p>

<p>’Tis meet he be condemned by course of law.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>But, in my mind, that were no policy.</p>

<p>The King will labor still to save his life,</p>

<p>The Commons haply rise to save his life,</p>

<p>And yet we have but trivial argument,</p>

<p>More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>So that, by this, you would not have him die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>’Tis York that hath more reason for his death.</p>

<p>But, my Lord Cardinal, and you, my lord of Suffolk,</p>

<p>Say as you think, and speak it from your souls:</p>

<p>Were ’t not all one an empty eagle were set</p>

<p>To guard the chicken from a hungry kite</p>

<p>As place Duke Humphrey for the King’s Protector?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>So the poor chicken should be sure of death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Madam, ’tis true; and were ’t not madness then</p>

<p>To make the fox surveyor of the fold–</p>

<p>Who, being accused a crafty murderer,</p>

<p>His guilt should be but idly posted over</p>

<p>Because his purpose is not executed?</p>

<p>No, let him die in that he is a fox,</p>

<p>By nature proved an enemy to the flock,</p>

<p>Before his chaps be stained with crimson blood,</p>

<p>As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.</p>

<p>And do not stand on quillets how to slay him–</p>

<p>Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,</p>

<p>Sleeping or waking. ’Tis no matter how,</p>

<p>So he be dead; for that is good deceit</p>

<p>Which mates him first that first intends deceit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Thrice noble Suffolk, ’tis resolutely spoke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Not resolute, except so much were done,</p>

<p>For things are often spoke and seldom meant;</p>

<p>But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,</p>

<p>Seeing the deed is meritorious,</p>

<p>And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,</p>

<p>Say but the word and I will be his priest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>But I would have him dead, my lord of Suffolk,</p>

<p>Ere you can take due orders for a priest.</p>

<p>Say you consent and censure well the deed,</p>

<p>And I’ll provide his executioner.</p>

<p>I tender so the safety of my liege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Here is my hand. The deed is worthy doing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc>  And so say I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>And I. And now we three have spoke it,</p>

<p>It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Post.]</i></center></p>

<p>Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain</p>

<p>A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!</p>

<p>What counsel give you in this weighty cause?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>That Somerset be sent as regent thither.</p>

<p>’Tis meet that lucky ruler be employed–</p>

<p>Witness the fortune he hath had in France.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Somerset</sc> <i>[advancing]</i></p>

<p>If York, with all his far-fet policy,</p>

<p>Had been the regent there instead of me,</p>

<p>He never would have stayed in France so long.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done.</p>

<p>I rather would have lost my life betimes</p>

<p>Than bring a burden of dishonor home</p>

<p>By staying there so long till all were lost.</p>

<p>Show me one scar charactered on thy skin.</p>

<p>Men’s flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire</p>

<p>If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with.–</p>

<p>No more, good York.–Sweet Somerset, be still.–</p>

<p>Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,</p>

<p>Might happily have proved far worse than his.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>What, worse than naught? Nay, then, a shame take</p>

<p>all!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Somerset</sc></p>

<p>And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>My lord of York, try what your fortune is.</p>

<p>Th’ uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms</p>

<p>And temper clay with blood of Englishmen.</p>

<p>To Ireland will you lead a band of men,</p>

<p>Collected choicely, from each county some,</p>

<p>And try your hap against the Irishmen?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>I will, my lord, so please his Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Why, our authority is his consent,</p>

<p>And what we do establish he confirms.</p>

<p>Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>I am content. Provide me soldiers, lords,</p>

<p>Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>A charge, Lord York, that I will see performed.</p>

<p>But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>No more of him, for I will deal with him,</p>

<p>That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.</p>

<p>And so break off; the day is almost spent.</p>

<p>Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>My lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days</p>

<p>At Bristow I expect my soldiers,</p>

<p>For there I’ll ship them all for Ireland.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>I’ll see it truly done, my lord of York.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but York exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts</p>

<p>And change misdoubt to resolution.</p>

<p>Be that thou hop’st to be, or what thou art</p>

<p>Resign to death; it is not worth th’ enjoying.</p>

<p>Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man</p>

<p>And find no harbor in a royal heart.</p>

<p>Faster than springtime showers comes thought on</p>

<p>thought,</p>

<p>And not a thought but thinks on dignity.</p>

<p>My brain, more busy than the laboring spider,</p>

<p>Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.</p>

<p>Well, nobles, well, ’tis politicly done</p>

<p>To send me packing with an host of men.</p>

<p>I fear me you but warm the starved snake,</p>

<p>Who, cherished in your breasts, will sting your</p>

<p>hearts.</p>

<p>’Twas men I lacked, and you will give them me;</p>

<p>I take it kindly. Yet be well assured</p>

<p>You put sharp weapons in a madman’s hands.</p>

<p>Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,</p>

<p>I will stir up in England some black storm</p>

<p>Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;</p>

<p>And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage</p>

<p>Until the golden circuit on my head,</p>

<p>Like to the glorious sun’s transparent beams,</p>

<p>Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.</p>

<p>And for a minister of my intent,</p>

<p>I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,</p>

<p>John Cade of Ashford,</p>

<p>To make commotion, as full well he can,</p>

<p>Under the title of John Mortimer.</p>

<p>In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade</p>

<p>Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,</p>

<p>And fought so long till that his thighs with darts</p>

<p>Were almost like a sharp-quilled porpentine;</p>

<p>And in the end being rescued, I have seen</p>

<p>Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,</p>

<p>Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.</p>

<p>Full often, like a shag-haired crafty kern,</p>

<p>Hath he conversed with the enemy,</p>

<p>And undiscovered come to me again</p>

<p>And given me notice of their villainies.</p>

<p>This devil here shall be my substitute;</p>

<p>For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,</p>

<p>In face, in gait, in speech he doth resemble.</p>

<p>By this, I shall perceive the Commons’ mind,</p>

<p>How they affect the house and claim of York.</p>

<p>Say he be taken, racked, and tortured,</p>

<p>I know no pain they can inflict upon him</p>

<p>Will make him say I moved him to those arms.</p>

<p>Say that he thrive, as ’tis great like he will,</p>

<p>Why then from Ireland come I with my strength</p>

<p>And reap the harvest which that rascal sowed.</p>

<p>For, Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,</p>

<p>And Henry put apart, the next for me.</p>
