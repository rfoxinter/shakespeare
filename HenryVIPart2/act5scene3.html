<p><center><i>[Alarum. Retreat. Enter York, Edward, Richard,</p>

<p>Warwick, and Soldiers, all wearing the white rose,</p>

<p>with Drum and Colors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Of Salisbury, who can report of him,</p>

<p>That winter lion, who in rage forgets</p>

<p>Aged contusions and all brush of time,</p>

<p>And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,</p>

<p>Repairs him with occasion? This happy day</p>

<p>Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,</p>

<p>If Salisbury be lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span>  My noble father,</p>

<p>Three times today I holp him to his horse,</p>

<p>Three times bestrid him. Thrice I led him off,</p>

<p>Persuaded him from any further act;</p>

<p>But still, where danger was, still there I met him,</p>

<p>And, like rich hangings in a homely house,</p>

<p>So was his will in his old feeble body.</p>

<p>But, noble as he is, look where he comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Salisbury, wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought today!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>By th’ Mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard.</p>

<p>God knows how long it is I have to live,</p>

<p>And it hath pleased Him that three times today</p>

<p>You have defended me from imminent death.</p>

<p>Well, lords, we have not got that which we have;</p>

<p>’Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,</p>

<p>Being opposites of such repairing nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>I know our safety is to follow them;</p>

<p>For, as I hear, the King is fled to London</p>

<p>To call a present court of Parliament.</p>

<p>Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.–</p>

<p>What says Lord Warwick? Shall we after them?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>After them? Nay, before them, if we can.</p>

<p>Now, by my hand, lords, ’twas a glorious day.</p>

<p>Saint Albans battle won by famous York</p>

<p>Shall be eternized in all age to come.–</p>

<p>Sound drum and trumpets, and to London all;</p>

<p>And more such days as these to us befall!</p>
