<p><center><i>[Enter King Henry, Queen Margaret, Gloucester the</p>

<p>Lord Protector, Cardinal, and Suffolk, and</p>

<p>Attendants, with Falconers hallowing.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook</p>

<p>I saw not better sport these seven years’ day.</p>

<p>Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high,</p>

<p>And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc> <i>[to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,</p>

<p>And what a pitch she flew above the rest!</p>

<p>To see how God in all his creatures works!</p>

<p>Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>No marvel, an it like your Majesty,</p>

<p>My Lord Protector’s hawks do tower so well;</p>

<p>They know their master loves to be aloft</p>

<p>And bears his thoughts above his falcon’s pitch.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>My lord, ’tis but a base ignoble mind</p>

<p>That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>I thought as much. He would be above the clouds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Ay, my Lord Cardinal, how think you by that?</p>

<p>Were it not good your Grace could fly to heaven?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>The treasury of everlasting joy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc> <i>[to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>Thy heaven is on Earth; thine eyes and thoughts</p>

<p>Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart.</p>

<p>Pernicious Protector, dangerous peer,</p>

<p>That smooth’st it so with king and commonweal!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>What, cardinal, is your priesthood grown</p>

<p>peremptory?</p>

<p>Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?</p>

<p>Churchmen so hot? Good uncle, hide such malice.</p>

<p>With such holiness, can you do it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>No malice, sir, no more than well becomes</p>

<p>So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>As who, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  Why, as you, my lord,</p>

<p>An ’t like your lordly Lord Protectorship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>And thy ambition, Gloucester.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  I prithee peace,</p>

<p>Good queen, and whet not on these furious peers,</p>

<p>For blessed are the peacemakers on Earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>Let me be blessed for the peace I make</p>

<p>Against this proud Protector with my sword!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc> <i>[aside to Cardinal]</i></p>

<p>Faith, holy uncle, would ’t were come to that!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc> <i>[aside to Gloucester]</i>  Marry, when thou</p>

<p>dar’st!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc> <i>[aside to Cardinal]</i></p>

<p>Make up no factious numbers for the matter.</p>

<p>In thine own person answer thy abuse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc> <i>[aside to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>Ay, where thou dar’st not peep. An if thou dar’st,</p>

<p>This evening, on the east side of the grove.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>How now, my lords?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc>  Believe me, cousin Gloucester,</p>

<p>Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,</p>

<p>We had had more sport. <i>[(Aside to Gloucester.)]</i></p>

<p>Come with thy two-hand sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>True, uncle. <i>[(Aside to Cardinal.)]</i> Are you advised?</p>

<p>The east side of the grove.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc> <i>[aside to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>I am with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Why, how now, uncle Gloucester?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.</p>

<p><i>[(Aside to Cardinal.)]</i> Now, by God’s mother, priest,</p>

<p>I’ll shave your crown for this,</p>

<p>Or all my fence shall fail.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc> <i>[aside to Gloucester]</i>  Medice, teipsum;</p>

<p>Protector, see to ’t well; protect yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.</p>

<p>How irksome is this music to my heart!</p>

<p>When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?</p>

<p>I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a man from St. Albans crying “A miracle!”]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  What means this noise?–</p>

<p>Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Man</sc>  A miracle, a miracle!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Come to the King, and tell him what miracle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Man</sc></p>

<p>Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban’s shrine</p>

<p>Within this half hour hath received his sight,</p>

<p>A man that ne’er saw in his life before.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Now, God be praised, that to believing souls</p>

<p>Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Mayor of Saint Albans, and his brethren,</p>

<p>bearing the man Simpcox between two in a chair,</p>

<p>followed by Simpcox’s Wife and Others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>Here comes the townsmen on procession</p>

<p>To present your Highness with the man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,</p>

<p>Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Stand by, my masters.–Bring him near the King.</p>

<p>His Highness’ pleasure is to talk with him.</p>

<p><center><i>[The two bearers bring the chair forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,</p>

<p>That we for thee may glorify the Lord.</p>

<p>What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  Born blind, an ’t please your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wife</sc>  Ay, indeed, was he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  What woman is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wife</sc>  His wife, an ’t like your Worship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst</p>

<p>have better told.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Where wert thou born?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc></p>

<p>At Berwick in the North, an ’t like your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Poor soul, God’s goodness hath been great to thee.</p>

<p>Let never day nor night unhallowed pass,</p>

<p>But still remember what the Lord hath done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Tell me, good fellow, cam’st thou here by chance,</p>

<p>Or of devotion to this holy shrine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc></p>

<p>God knows, of pure devotion, being called</p>

<p>A hundred times and oftener in my sleep</p>

<p>By good Saint Alban, who said “Simon, come,</p>

<p>Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wife</sc></p>

<p>Most true, forsooth, and many time and oft</p>

<p>Myself have heard a voice to call him so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc>  What, art thou lame?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  Ay, God Almighty help me!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  How cam’st thou so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  A fall off of a tree.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wife</sc>  A plum tree, master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  How long hast thou been blind?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  O, born so, master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  What, and wouldst climb a tree?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  But that in all my life, when I was a youth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wife</sc>  Too true, and bought his climbing very dear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Mass, thou lov’dst plums well, that</p>

<p>wouldst venture so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  Alas, good master, my wife desired some</p>

<p>damsons, and made me climb, with danger of my</p>

<p>life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>A subtle knave, but yet it shall not serve.–</p>

<p>Let me see thine eyes. Wink now. Now open them.</p>

<p>In my opinion, yet thou seest not well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and</p>

<p>Saint Alban.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Sayst thou me so? What color is this cloak of?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  Red, master, red as blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Why, that’s well said. What color is my gown of?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  Black, forsooth, coal-black as jet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Why, then, thou know’st what color jet is of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>And yet, I think, jet did he never see.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wife</sc></p>

<p>Never, before this day, in all his life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Tell me, sirrah, what’s my name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  Alas, master, I know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc> <i>[pointing]</i>  What’s his name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  I know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc> <i>[pointing to someone else]</i>  Nor his?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  No, indeed, master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  What’s thine own name?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  Sander Simpcox, an if it please you, master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Then, Sander, sit there, the lying’st knave</p>

<p>in Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind,</p>

<p>thou mightst as well have known all our names as</p>

<p>thus to name the several colors we do wear. Sight</p>

<p>may distinguish of colors; but suddenly to nominate</p>

<p>them all, it is impossible.–My lords, Saint</p>

<p>Alban here hath done a miracle; and would you</p>

<p>not think his cunning to be great that could</p>

<p>restore this cripple to his legs again?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  O master, that you could!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  My masters of Saint Albans, have you not</p>

<p>beadles in your town and things called whips?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mayor</sc>  Yes, my lord, if it please your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Then send for one presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mayor</sc>  Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.</p>

<p><center><i>[A man exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Now fetch me a stool hither by and by.</p>

<p><i>[One brings a stool.]</i> Now, sirrah, if you mean to</p>

<p>save yourself from whipping, leap me over this</p>

<p>stool, and run away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone.</p>

<p>You go about to torture me in vain.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Beadle with whips.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Well, sir, we must have you find your</p>

<p>legs.–Sirrah beadle, whip him till he leap over</p>

<p>that same stool.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beadle</sc>  I will, my lord.–Come on, sirrah, off with</p>

<p>your doublet quickly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Simpcox</sc>  Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to</p>

<p>stand.</p>

<p><center><i>[After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps</p>

<p>over the stool and runs away; and they follow</p>

<p>and cry “A miracle!”]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>It made me laugh to see the villain run.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc> <i>[to the Beadle]</i></p>

<p>Follow the knave, and take this drab away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Wife</sc>  Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Let them be whipped through every market town</p>

<p>Till they come to Berwick, from whence they came.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Beadle, Mayor, Wife, and the others from</p>

<p>Saint Albans exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>Duke Humphrey has done a miracle today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>True, made the lame to leap and fly away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>But you have done more miracles than I.</p>

<p>You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Buckingham.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold:</p>

<p>A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,</p>

<p>Under the countenance and confederacy</p>

<p>Of Lady Eleanor, the Protector’s wife,</p>

<p>The ringleader and head of all this rout,</p>

<p>Have practiced dangerously against your state,</p>

<p>Dealing with witches and with conjurers,</p>

<p>Whom we have apprehended in the fact,</p>

<p>Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,</p>

<p>Demanding of King Henry’s life and death</p>

<p>And other of your Highness’ Privy Council,</p>

<p>As more at large your Grace shall understand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cardinal</sc></p>

<p>And so, my Lord Protector, by this means</p>

<p>Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.</p>

<p><i>[Aside to Gloucester.]</i> This news, I think, hath turned</p>

<p>your weapon’s edge;</p>

<p>’Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart.</p>

<p>Sorrow and grief have vanquished all my powers,</p>

<p>And, vanquished as I am, I yield to thee,</p>

<p>Or to the meanest groom.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,</p>

<p>Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest,</p>

<p>And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal</p>

<p>How I have loved my king and commonweal;</p>

<p>And, for my wife, I know not how it stands.</p>

<p>Sorry I am to hear what I have heard.</p>

<p>Noble she is; but if she have forgot</p>

<p>Honor and virtue, and conversed with such</p>

<p>As, like to pitch, defile nobility,</p>

<p>I banish her my bed and company</p>

<p>And give her as a prey to law and shame</p>

<p>That hath dishonored Gloucester’s honest name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Well, for this night we will repose us here.</p>

<p>Tomorrow toward London back again,</p>

<p>To look into this business thoroughly,</p>

<p>And call these foul offenders to their answers,</p>

<p>And poise the cause in Justice’ equal scales,</p>

<p>Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause</p>

<p>prevails.</p>
