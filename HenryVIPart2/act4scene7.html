<p><center><i>[Alarums. Matthew Gough is slain, and all the rest.</p>

<p>Then enter Jack Cade with his company.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  So, sirs. Now go some and pull down the Savoy;</p>

<p>others to th’ Inns of Court. Down with them all!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc>  I have a suit unto your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc>  Only that the laws of England may come out of</p>

<p>your mouth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holland</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Mass, ’twill be sore law, then, for he</p>

<p>was thrust in the mouth with a spear, and ’tis not</p>

<p>whole yet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Smith</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Nay, John, it will be stinking law, for</p>

<p>his breath stinks with eating toasted cheese.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  I have thought upon it; it shall be so. Away!</p>

<p>Burn all the records of the realm. My mouth shall</p>

<p>be the Parliament of England.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Holland</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Then we are like to have biting</p>

<p>statutes–unless his teeth be pulled out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  And henceforward all things shall be in</p>

<p>common.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  My lord, a prize, a prize! Here’s the Lord</p>

<p>Saye, which sold the towns in France, he that</p>

<p>made us pay one-and-twenty fifteens, and one</p>

<p>shilling to the pound, the last subsidy.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter George with the Lord Saye.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times.–Ah,</p>

<p>thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord, now</p>

<p>art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction</p>

<p>regal. What canst thou answer to my Majesty for</p>

<p>giving up of Normandy unto Monsieur Basimecu,</p>

<p>the Dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by</p>

<p>these presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer,</p>

<p>that I am the besom that must sweep the</p>

<p>court clean of such filth as thou art. Thou hast</p>

<p>most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm</p>

<p>in erecting a grammar school; and whereas,</p>

<p>before, our forefathers had no other books but the</p>

<p>score and the tally, thou hast caused printing to be</p>

<p>used, and, contrary to the King his crown and dignity,</p>

<p>thou hast built a paper mill. It will be proved</p>

<p>to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually</p>

<p>talk of a noun and a verb and such abominable</p>

<p>words as no Christian ear can endure to hear.</p>

<p>Thou hast appointed justices of peace to call poor</p>

<p>men before them about matters they were not able</p>

<p>to answer. Moreover, thou hast put them in prison;</p>

<p>and, because they could not read, thou hast</p>

<p>hanged them, when indeed only for that cause</p>

<p>they have been most worthy to live. Thou dost ride</p>

<p>on a footcloth, dost thou not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc>  What of that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Marry, thou oughtst not to let thy horse wear a</p>

<p>cloak when honester men than thou go in their</p>

<p>hose and doublets.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc>  And work in their shirt too–as myself, for example,</p>

<p>that am a butcher.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc>  You men of Kent–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc>  What say you of Kent?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc>  Nothing but this: ’tis bona terra, mala gens.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Away with him, away with him! He speaks</p>

<p>Latin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc></p>

<p>Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.</p>

<p>Kent, in the commentaries Caesar writ,</p>

<p>Is termed the civil’st place of all this isle.</p>

<p>Sweet is the country, because full of riches;</p>

<p>The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;</p>

<p>Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.</p>

<p>I sold not Maine; I lost not Normandy;</p>

<p>Yet to recover them would lose my life.</p>

<p>Justice with favor have I always done;</p>

<p>Prayers and tears have moved me; gifts could never.</p>

<p>When have I aught exacted at your hands</p>

<p>Kent to maintain, the King, the realm, and you?</p>

<p>Large gifts have I bestowed on learned clerks,</p>

<p>Because my book preferred me to the King.</p>

<p>And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,</p>

<p>Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,</p>

<p>Unless you be possessed with devilish spirits,</p>

<p>You cannot but forbear to murder me.</p>

<p>This tongue hath parleyed unto foreign kings</p>

<p>For your behoof–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Tut, when struck’st thou one blow in the field?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc></p>

<p>Great men have reaching hands. Oft have I struck</p>

<p>Those that I never saw, and struck them dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>George</sc>  O monstrous coward! What, to come behind</p>

<p>folks?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc></p>

<p>These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Give him a box o’ th’ ear, and that will make ’em</p>

<p>red again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc></p>

<p>Long sitting to determine poor men’s causes</p>

<p>Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  You shall have a hempen caudle, then, and</p>

<p>the help of hatchet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc>  Why dost thou quiver, man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc>  The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Nay, he nods at us, as who should say “I’ll be</p>

<p>even with you.” I’ll see if his head will stand steadier</p>

<p>on a pole, or no. Take him away, and behead</p>

<p>him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc></p>

<p>Tell me, wherein have I offended most?</p>

<p>Have I affected wealth or honor? Speak.</p>

<p>Are my chests filled up with extorted gold?</p>

<p>Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?</p>

<p>Whom have I injured, that you seek my death?</p>

<p>These hands are free from guiltless blood-shedding,</p>

<p>This breast from harboring foul deceitful thoughts.</p>

<p>O, let me live!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  I feel remorse in myself with his words, but I’ll</p>

<p>bridle it. He shall die, an it be but for pleading so</p>

<p>well for his life. Away with him! He has a familiar</p>

<p>under his tongue; he speaks not i’ God’s name. Go,</p>

<p>take him away, I say, and strike off his head</p>

<p>presently; and then break into his son-in-law’s</p>

<p>house, Sir James Cromer, and strike off his head;</p>

<p>and bring them both upon two poles hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  It shall be done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc></p>

<p>Ah, countrymen, if when you make your prayers,</p>

<p>God should be so obdurate as yourselves,</p>

<p>How would it fare with your departed souls?</p>

<p>And therefore yet relent, and save my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Away with him, and do as I command you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Some exit with Lord Saye.]</i></center></p>

<p>The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a</p>

<p>head on his shoulders unless he pay me tribute.</p>

<p>There shall not a maid be married but she shall</p>

<p>pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it. Men</p>

<p>shall hold of me in capite; and we charge and command</p>

<p>that their wives be as free as heart can wish</p>

<p>or tongue can tell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dick</sc>  My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside and take</p>

<p>up commodities upon our bills?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  Marry, presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  O, brave!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter one with the heads of Lord Saye and Sir James</p>

<p>Cromer on poles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cade</sc>  But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another,</p>

<p>for they loved well when they were alive. <i>[The</p>

<p>heads are brought together.]</i> Now part them again,</p>

<p>lest they consult about the giving up of some more</p>

<p>towns in France. Soldiers, defer the spoil of the</p>

<p>city until night, for, with these borne before us</p>

<p>instead of maces, will we ride through the streets</p>

<p>and at every corner have them kiss. Away!</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with his company.]</i></center></p>
