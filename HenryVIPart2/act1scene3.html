<p><center><i>[Enter three or four Petitioners, Peter, the</p>

<p>Armorer’s man, being one.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Petitioner</span>  My masters, let’s stand close. My</p>

<p>Lord Protector will come this way by and by, and</p>

<p>then we may deliver our supplications in the quill.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Petitioner</span>  Marry, the Lord protect him, for</p>

<p>he’s a good man! Jesu bless him!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Suffolk, wearing the red rose,</p>

<p>and Queen Margaret.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Petitioner</span>  Here he comes, methinks, and the</p>

<p>Queen with him. I’ll be the first, sure.</p>

<p><center><i>[He steps forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Petitioner</span>  Come back, fool! This is the Duke</p>

<p>of Suffolk, and not my Lord Protector.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  How now, fellow? Wouldst anything with</p>

<p>me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Petitioner</span>  I pray, my lord, pardon me. I took</p>

<p>you for my Lord Protector.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[takes a petition and reads.]</i>  To my</p>

<p>Lord Protector. Are your supplications to his Lordship?</p>

<p>Let me see them.–What is thine?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Petitioner</span>  Mine is, an ’t please your Grace,</p>

<p>against John Goodman, my Lord Cardinal’s man,</p>

<p>for keeping my house, and lands, and wife and all,</p>

<p>from me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  Thy wife too? That’s some wrong indeed.–</p>

<p>What’s yours? <i>[Taking a petition.]</i> What’s here?</p>

<p><i>[(Reads.)]</i> Against the Duke of Suffolk for enclosing</p>

<p>the commons of Melford. How now, sir knave?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Petitioner</span>  Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner</p>

<p>of our whole township.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span> <i>[showing his petition]</i>  Against my master,</p>

<p>Thomas Horner, for saying that the Duke of York</p>

<p>was rightful heir to the crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  What sayst thou? Did the Duke of</p>

<p>York say he was rightful heir to the crown?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  That my master was? No, forsooth. My master</p>

<p>said that he was and that the King was an</p>

<p>usurper.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[calling]</i>  Who is there?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Take this fellow in, and send for his master with a</p>

<p>pursuivant presently.–We’ll hear more of your</p>

<p>matter before the King.</p>

<p><center><i>[Peter exits with Servant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>And as for you that love to be protected</p>

<p>Under the wings of our Protector’s grace,</p>

<p>Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.</p>

<p><center><i>[Tear the supplication.]</i></center></p>

<p>Away, base cullions.–Suffolk, let them go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  Come, let’s be gone.     <i><i>[They exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>My lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,</p>

<p>Is this the fashions in the court of England?</p>

<p>Is this the government of Britain’s isle</p>

<p>And this the royalty of Albion’s king?</p>

<p>What, shall King Henry be a pupil still</p>

<p>Under the surly Gloucester’s governance?</p>

<p>Am I a queen in title and in style,</p>

<p>And must be made a subject to a duke?</p>

<p>I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours</p>

<p>Thou rann’st atilt in honor of my love</p>

<p>And stol’st away the ladies’ hearts of France,</p>

<p>I thought King Henry had resembled thee</p>

<p>In courage, courtship, and proportion.</p>

<p>But all his mind is bent to holiness,</p>

<p>To number Ave Marys on his beads;</p>

<p>His champions are the prophets and apostles,</p>

<p>His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,</p>

<p>His study is his tiltyard, and his loves</p>

<p>Are brazen images of canonized saints.</p>

<p>I would the College of the Cardinals</p>

<p>Would choose him pope and carry him to Rome</p>

<p>And set the triple crown upon his head!</p>

<p>That were a state fit for his holiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Madam, be patient. As I was cause</p>

<p>Your Highness came to England, so will I</p>

<p>In England work your Grace’s full content.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Besides the haughty Protector, have we Beaufort</p>

<p>The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,</p>

<p>And grumbling York; and not the least of these</p>

<p>But can do more in England than the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>And he of these that can do most of all</p>

<p>Cannot do more in England than the Nevilles;</p>

<p>Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Not all these lords do vex me half so much</p>

<p>As that proud dame, the Lord Protector’s wife.</p>

<p>She sweeps it through the court with troops of</p>

<p>ladies,</p>

<p>More like an empress than Duke Humphrey’s wife.</p>

<p>Strangers in court do take her for the Queen.</p>

<p>She bears a duke’s revenues on her back,</p>

<p>And in her heart she scorns our poverty.</p>

<p>Shall I not live to be avenged on her?</p>

<p>Contemptuous baseborn callet as she is,</p>

<p>She vaunted ’mongst her minions t’ other day</p>

<p>The very train of her worst wearing gown</p>

<p>Was better worth than all my father’s lands</p>

<p>Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Madam, myself have limed a bush for her</p>

<p>And placed a choir of such enticing birds</p>

<p>That she will light to listen to the lays</p>

<p>And never mount to trouble you again.</p>

<p>So let her rest. And, madam, list to me,</p>

<p>For I am bold to counsel you in this:</p>

<p>Although we fancy not the Cardinal,</p>

<p>Yet must we join with him and with the lords</p>

<p>Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.</p>

<p>As for the Duke of York, this late complaint</p>

<p>Will make but little for his benefit.</p>

<p>So, one by one, we’ll weed them all at last,</p>

<p>And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Sound a sennet. Enter King Henry, Duke Humphrey</p>

<p>of Gloucester, Cardinal, Somerset, wearing the red</p>

<p>rose, Buckingham, Salisbury; York and Warwick, both</p>

<p>wearing the white rose; and the Duchess of</p>

<p>Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>For my part, noble lords, I care not which;</p>

<p>Or Somerset or York, all’s one to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>If York have ill demeaned himself in France,</p>

<p>Then let him be denied the regentship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>If Somerset be unworthy of the place,</p>

<p>Let York be regent; I will yield to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Whether your Grace be worthy, yea or no,</p>

<p>Dispute not that. York is the worthier.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cardinal</span></p>

<p>Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>The Cardinal’s not my better in the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Warwick may live to be the best of all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Peace, son.–And show some reason, Buckingham,</p>

<p>Why Somerset should be preferred in this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Because the King, forsooth, will have it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Madam, the King is old enough himself</p>

<p>To give his censure. These are no women’s matters.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>If he be old enough, what needs your Grace</p>

<p>To be Protector of his Excellence?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Madam, I am Protector of the realm,</p>

<p>And at his pleasure will resign my place.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Resign it, then, and leave thine insolence.</p>

<p>Since thou wert king–as who is king but thou?–</p>

<p>The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack,</p>

<p>The Dauphin hath prevailed beyond the seas,</p>

<p>And all the peers and nobles of the realm</p>

<p>Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cardinal</span> <i>[to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>The Commons hast thou racked; the clergy’s bags</p>

<p>Are lank and lean with thy extortions.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span> <i>[to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife’s attire</p>

<p>Have cost a mass of public treasury.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span> <i>[to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>Thy cruelty in execution</p>

<p>Upon offenders hath exceeded law</p>

<p>And left thee to the mercy of the law.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>Thy sale of offices and towns in France,</p>

<p>If they were known, as the suspect is great,</p>

<p>Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gloucester exits.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Queen Margaret drops her fan.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Duchess.]</i> Give me my fan. What, minion, can</p>

<p>you not?     <i><i>[She gives the Duchess a box on the ear.]</i></i></p>

<p>I cry you mercy, madam. Was it you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>Was ’t I? Yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>Could I come near your beauty with my nails,</p>

<p>I’d set my ten commandments in your face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Sweet aunt, be quiet. ’Twas against her will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>Against her will, good king? Look to ’t in time.</p>

<p>She’ll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby.</p>

<p>Though in this place most master wear no breeches,</p>

<p>She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.</p>

<p><center><i>[Eleanor, the Duchess, exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span> <i>[aside to Cardinal]</i></p>

<p>Lord Cardinal, I will follow Eleanor</p>

<p>And listen after Humphrey how he proceeds.</p>

<p>She’s tickled now; her fume needs no spurs;</p>

<p>She’ll gallop far enough to her destruction.</p>

<p><center><i>[Buckingham exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Now, lords, my choler being overblown</p>

<p>With walking once about the quadrangle,</p>

<p>I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.</p>

<p>As for your spiteful false objections,</p>

<p>Prove them, and I lie open to the law;</p>

<p>But God in mercy so deal with my soul</p>

<p>As I in duty love my king and country!</p>

<p>But, to the matter that we have in hand:</p>

<p>I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man</p>

<p>To be your regent in the realm of France.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Before we make election, give me leave</p>

<p>To show some reason, of no little force,</p>

<p>That York is most unmeet of any man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>I’ll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:</p>

<p>First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;</p>

<p>Next, if I be appointed for the place,</p>

<p>My lord of Somerset will keep me here</p>

<p>Without discharge, money, or furniture</p>

<p>Till France be won into the Dauphin’s hands.</p>

<p>Last time I danced attendance on his will</p>

<p>Till Paris was besieged, famished, and lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>That can I witness, and a fouler fact</p>

<p>Did never traitor in the land commit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  Peace, headstrong Warwick!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Horner, the Armorer, and his Man</p>

<p>Peter, under guard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Because here is a man accused of treason.</p>

<p>Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Doth anyone accuse York for a traitor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>What mean’st thou, Suffolk? Tell me, what are</p>

<p>these?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Please it your Majesty, this is the man</p>

<p>That doth accuse his master of high treason.</p>

<p>His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,</p>

<p>Was rightful heir unto the English crown,</p>

<p>And that your Majesty was an usurper.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  Say, man, were these thy words?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horner</span>  An ’t shall please your Majesty, I never said</p>

<p>nor thought any such matter. God is my witness, I</p>

<p>am falsely accused by the villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak</p>

<p>them to me in the garret one night as we were</p>

<p>scouring my lord of York’s armor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span> <i>[to Horner]</i></p>

<p>Base dunghill villain and mechanical,</p>

<p>I’ll have thy head for this thy traitor’s speech!–</p>

<p>I do beseech your royal Majesty,</p>

<p>Let him have all the rigor of the law.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horner</span>  Alas, my lord, hang me if ever I spake the</p>

<p>words. My accuser is my prentice; and when I did</p>

<p>correct him for his fault the other day, he did vow</p>

<p>upon his knees he would be even with me. I have</p>

<p>good witness of this. Therefore I beseech your</p>

<p>Majesty, do not cast away an honest man for a</p>

<p>villain’s accusation!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>This doom, my lord, if I may judge:</p>

<p>Let Somerset be regent o’er the French,</p>

<p>Because in York this breeds suspicion;</p>

<p>And let these have a day appointed them</p>

<p>For single combat in convenient place,</p>

<p>For he hath witness of his servant’s malice.</p>

<p>This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey’s doom.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>I humbly thank your royal Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horner</span></p>

<p>And I accept the combat willingly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God’s sake pity</p>

<p>my case! The spite of man prevaileth against me. O</p>

<p>Lord, have mercy upon me! I shall never be able to</p>

<p>fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Sirrah, or you must fight or else be hanged.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span>  Away with them to prison; and the day of</p>

<p>combat shall be the last of the next month.–</p>

<p>Come, Somerset, we’ll see thee sent away.</p>
