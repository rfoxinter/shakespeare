<p><center><i>[Enter Duke Humphrey of Gloucester and his wife</p>

<p>the Duchess Eleanor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Why droops my lord like over-ripened corn</p>

<p>Hanging the head at Ceres’ plenteous load?</p>

<p>Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,</p>

<p>As frowning at the favors of the world?</p>

<p>Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,</p>

<p>Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?</p>

<p>What seest thou there? King Henry’s diadem,</p>

<p>Enchased with all the honors of the world?</p>

<p>If so, gaze on and grovel on thy face</p>

<p>Until thy head be circled with the same.</p>

<p>Put forth thy hand; reach at the glorious gold.</p>

<p>What, is ’t too short? I’ll lengthen it with mine;</p>

<p>And, having both together heaved it up,</p>

<p>We’ll both together lift our heads to heaven</p>

<p>And never more abase our sight so low</p>

<p>As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,</p>

<p>Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts!</p>

<p>And may that hour when I imagine ill</p>

<p>Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,</p>

<p>Be my last breathing in this mortal world!</p>

<p>My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>What dreamed my lord? Tell me, and I’ll requite it</p>

<p>With sweet rehearsal of my morning’s dream.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Methought this staff, mine office badge in court,</p>

<p>Was broke in twain–by whom I have forgot,</p>

<p>But, as I think, it was by th’ Cardinal–</p>

<p>And on the pieces of the broken wand</p>

<p>Were placed the heads of Edmund, Duke of</p>

<p>Somerset,</p>

<p>And William de la Pole, first Duke of Suffolk.</p>

<p>This was my dream. What it doth bode God knows.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Tut, this was nothing but an argument</p>

<p>That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester’s grove</p>

<p>Shall lose his head for his presumption.</p>

<p>But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:</p>

<p>Methought I sat in seat of majesty,</p>

<p>In the cathedral church of Westminster</p>

<p>And in that chair where kings and queens were</p>

<p>crowned,</p>

<p>Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneeled to me</p>

<p>And on my head did set the diadem.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright.</p>

<p>Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,</p>

<p>Art thou not second woman in the realm</p>

<p>And the Protector’s wife, beloved of him?</p>

<p>Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,</p>

<p>Above the reach or compass of thy thought?</p>

<p>And wilt thou still be hammering treachery</p>

<p>To tumble down thy husband and thyself</p>

<p>From top of honor to disgrace’s feet?</p>

<p>Away from me, and let me hear no more!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>What, what, my lord? Are you so choleric</p>

<p>With Eleanor for telling but her dream?</p>

<p>Next time I’ll keep my dreams unto myself</p>

<p>And not be checked.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Nay, be not angry. I am pleased again.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>My Lord Protector, ’tis his Highness’ pleasure</p>

<p>You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans,</p>

<p>Whereas the King and Queen do mean to hawk.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>I go.–Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Yes, my good lord. I’ll follow presently.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gloucester exits, with Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<p>Follow I must; I cannot go before</p>

<p>While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.</p>

<p>Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,</p>

<p>I would remove these tedious stumbling blocks</p>

<p>And smooth my way upon their headless necks;</p>

<p>And, being a woman, I will not be slack</p>

<p>To play my part in Fortune’s pageant.–</p>

<p>Where are you there? Sir John! Nay, fear not, man.</p>

<p>We are alone; here’s none but thee and I.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John Hume.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hume</sc></p>

<p>Jesus preserve your royal Majesty!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>What sayst thou? “Majesty”? I am but “Grace.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hume</sc></p>

<p>But by the grace of God and Hume’s advice,</p>

<p>Your Grace’s title shall be multiplied.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>What sayst thou, man? Hast thou as yet conferred</p>

<p>With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,</p>

<p>With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?</p>

<p>And will they undertake to do me good?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hume</sc></p>

<p>This they have promised: to show your Highness</p>

<p>A spirit raised from depth of underground</p>

<p>That shall make answer to such questions</p>

<p>As by your Grace shall be propounded him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>It is enough. I’ll think upon the questions.</p>

<p>When from Saint Albans we do make return,</p>

<p>We’ll see these things effected to the full.</p>

<p>Here, Hume, take this reward.</p>

<p><center><i>[She gives him money.]</i></center></p>

<p>Make merry, man,</p>

<p>With thy confederates in this weighty cause.</p>

<p><center><i>[Duchess exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hume</sc></p>

<p>Hume must make merry with the Duchess’ gold.</p>

<p>Marry, and shall! But, how now, Sir John Hume?</p>

<p>Seal up your lips, and give no words but “mum”;</p>

<p>The business asketh silent secrecy.</p>

<p>Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch;</p>

<p>Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.</p>

<p>Yet have I gold flies from another coast–</p>

<p>I dare not say, from the rich cardinal</p>

<p>And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,</p>

<p>Yet I do find it so. For, to be plain,</p>

<p>They, knowing Dame Eleanor’s aspiring humor,</p>

<p>Have hired me to undermine the Duchess</p>

<p>And buzz these conjurations in her brain.</p>

<p>They say a crafty knave does need no broker,</p>

<p>Yet am I Suffolk and the Cardinal’s broker.</p>

<p>Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near</p>

<p>To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.</p>

<p>Well, so it stands; and thus I fear at last</p>

<p>Hume’s knavery will be the Duchess’ wrack,</p>

<p>And her attainture will be Humphrey’s fall.</p>

<p>Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.</p>
