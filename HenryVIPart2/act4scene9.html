<p><center><i>[Sound trumpets. Enter King Henry, Queen Margaret,</p>

<p>and Somerset on the terrace, aloft.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Was ever king that joyed an earthly throne</p>

<p>And could command no more content than I?</p>

<p>No sooner was I crept out of my cradle</p>

<p>But I was made a king at nine months old.</p>

<p>Was never subject longed to be a king</p>

<p>As I do long and wish to be a subject!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Buckingham and old Clifford.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Health and glad tidings to your Majesty!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surprised,</p>

<p>Or is he but retired to make him strong?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter below multitudes with halters about their necks.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clifford</sc></p>

<p>He is fled, my lord, and all his powers do yield</p>

<p>And, humbly thus, with halters on their necks,</p>

<p>Expect your Highness’ doom of life or death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates</p>

<p>To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!</p>

<p>Soldiers, this day have you redeemed your lives</p>

<p>And showed how well you love your prince and</p>

<p>country.</p>

<p>Continue still in this so good a mind,</p>

<p>And Henry, though he be infortunate,</p>

<p>Assure yourselves, will never be unkind.</p>

<p>And so with thanks and pardon to you all,</p>

<p>I do dismiss you to your several countries.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  God save the King! God save the King!</p>

<p><center><i>[The multitudes exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Please it your Grace to be advertised</p>

<p>The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland</p>

<p>And, with a puissant and a mighty power</p>

<p>Of gallowglasses and stout kerns,</p>

<p>Is marching hitherward in proud array,</p>

<p>And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,</p>

<p>His arms are only to remove from thee</p>

<p>The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms a traitor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Thus stands my state, ’twixt Cade and York</p>

<p>distressed,</p>

<p>Like to a ship that, having scaped a tempest,</p>

<p>Is straightway calmed and boarded with a pirate.</p>

<p>But now is Cade driven back, his men dispersed,</p>

<p>And now is York in arms to second him.</p>

<p>I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,</p>

<p>And ask him what’s the reason of these arms.</p>

<p>Tell him I’ll send Duke Edmund to the Tower.–</p>

<p>And, Somerset, we will commit thee thither</p>

<p>Until his army be dismissed from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Somerset</sc>  My lord,</p>

<p>I’ll yield myself to prison willingly,</p>

<p>Or unto death, to do my country good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc> <i>[to Buckingham]</i></p>

<p>In any case, be not too rough in terms,</p>

<p>For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>I will, my lord, and doubt not so to deal</p>

<p>As all things shall redound unto your good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Come, wife, let’s in, and learn to govern better,</p>

<p>For yet may England curse my wretched reign.</p>
