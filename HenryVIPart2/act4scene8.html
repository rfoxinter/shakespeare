<p><center><i>[Alarum, and retreat. Enter again Cade and</p>

<p>all his rabblement.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cade</span>  Up Fish Street! Down Saint Magnus’ Corner!</p>

<p>Kill and knock down! Throw them into Thames!</p>

<p><center><i>[Sound a parley.]</i></center></p>

<p>What noise is this I hear? Dare any be so bold to</p>

<p>sound retreat or parley when I command them</p>

<p>kill?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Buckingham and old Clifford with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>Ay, here they be that dare and will disturb thee.</p>

<p>Know, Cade, we come ambassadors from the King</p>

<p>Unto the Commons, whom thou hast misled,</p>

<p>And here pronounce free pardon to them all</p>

<p>That will forsake thee and go home in peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>What say you, countrymen? Will you relent</p>

<p>And yield to mercy whil’st ’tis offered you,</p>

<p>Or let a rabble lead you to your deaths?</p>

<p>Who loves the King and will embrace his pardon,</p>

<p>Fling up his cap and say “God save his Majesty!”</p>

<p>Who hateth him and honors not his father,</p>

<p>Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake,</p>

<p>Shake he his weapon at us and pass by.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  God save the King! God save the King!</p>

<p><center><i>[They fling their caps in the air.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cade</span>  What, Buckingham and Clifford, are you so</p>

<p>brave?–And, you base peasants, do you believe</p>

<p>him? Will you needs be hanged with your pardons</p>

<p>about your necks? Hath my sword therefore broke</p>

<p>through London gates, that you should leave me at</p>

<p>the White Hart in Southwark? I thought you</p>

<p>would never have given out these arms till you had</p>

<p>recovered your ancient freedom. But you are all</p>

<p>recreants and dastards, and delight to live in slavery</p>

<p>to the nobility. Let them break your backs with</p>

<p>burdens, take your houses over your heads, ravish</p>

<p>your wives and daughters before your faces. For</p>

<p>me, I will make shift for one, and so God’s curse</p>

<p>light upon you all!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  We’ll follow Cade! We’ll follow Cade!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span>  Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth,</p>

<p>That thus you do exclaim you’ll go with him?</p>

<p>Will he conduct you through the heart of France</p>

<p>And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?</p>

<p>Alas, he hath no home, no place to fly to,</p>

<p>Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,</p>

<p>Unless by robbing of your friends and us.</p>

<p>Were ’t not a shame that, whilst you live at jar,</p>

<p>The fearful French, whom you late vanquished,</p>

<p>Should make a start o’er seas and vanquish you?</p>

<p>Methinks already in this civil broil</p>

<p>I see them lording it in London streets,</p>

<p>Crying “Villiago!” unto all they meet.</p>

<p>Better ten thousand baseborn Cades miscarry</p>

<p>Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman’s mercy.</p>

<p>To France, to France, and get what you have lost!</p>

<p>Spare England, for it is your native coast.</p>

<p>Henry hath money; you are strong and manly.</p>

<p>God on our side, doubt not of victory.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span></p>

<p>A Clifford! A Clifford! We’ll follow the King and</p>

<p>Clifford!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cade</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Was ever feather so lightly blown to and</p>

<p>fro as this multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth</p>

<p>hales them to an hundred mischiefs and makes</p>

<p>them leave me desolate. I see them lay their heads</p>

<p>together to surprise me. My sword make way for</p>

<p>me, for here is no staying!–In despite of the devils</p>

<p>and hell, have through the very middest of you!</p>

<p>And heavens and honor be witness that no want of</p>

<p>resolution in me, but only my followers’ base and</p>

<p>ignominious treasons, makes me betake me to my</p>

<p>heels.     <i><i>[He exits, running.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>What, is he fled? Go, some, and follow him;</p>

<p>And he that brings his head unto the King</p>

<p>Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.</p>

<p><center><i>[Some of them exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Follow me, soldiers. We’ll devise a means</p>

<p>To reconcile you all unto the King.</p>

<p><center><i>[All exit.]</i></center></p>
