<p><center><i>[Enter the Witch Margery Jourdain, the two Priests</p>

<p>Hume and Southwell, and Bolingbroke, a conjurer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hume</span>  Come, my masters. The Duchess, I tell you,</p>

<p>expects performance of your promises.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span>  Master Hume, we are therefore provided.</p>

<p>Will her Ladyship behold and hear our</p>

<p>exorcisms?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hume</span>  Ay, what else? Fear you not her courage.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span>  I have heard her reported to be a</p>

<p>woman of an invincible spirit. But it shall be convenient,</p>

<p>Master Hume, that you be by her aloft</p>

<p>while we be busy below; and so, I pray you, go, in</p>

<p>God’s name, and leave us.     <i><i>[Hume exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Mother Jourdain, be you prostrate and grovel on</p>

<p>the earth. <i>[She lies face downward.]</i> John Southwell,</p>

<p>read you; and let us to our work.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester,</p>

<p>with Hume, aloft.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span>  Well said, my masters, and welcome all. To</p>

<p>this gear, the sooner the better.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>Patience, good lady. Wizards know their times.</p>

<p>Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,</p>

<p>The time of night when Troy was set on fire,</p>

<p>The time when screech owls cry and bandogs howl,</p>

<p>And spirits walk, and ghosts break up their graves–</p>

<p>That time best fits the work we have in hand.</p>

<p>Madam, sit you, and fear not. Whom we raise</p>

<p>We will make fast within a hallowed verge.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Here they do the ceremonies belonging, and</p>

<p>make the circle. Bolingbroke or Southwell reads</p>

<p>“Conjuro te, etc.” It thunders and lightens terribly;</p>

<p>then the Spirit riseth.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Spirit</span>  Adsum.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Jourdain</span>  Asmath,</p>

<p>By the eternal God, whose name and power</p>

<p>Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask,</p>

<p>For till thou speak, thou shalt not pass from hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Spirit</span></p>

<p>Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span> <i>[reading from a paper, while Southwell</p>

<p>writes]</i></p>

<p>First of the King: What shall of him become?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Spirit</span></p>

<p>The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose,</p>

<p>But him outlive and die a violent death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span> <i>[reads]</i></p>

<p>What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Spirit</span></p>

<p>By water shall he die and take his end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span> <i>[reads]</i></p>

<p>What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Spirit</span>  Let him shun castles.</p>

<p>Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains</p>

<p>Than where castles mounted stand.</p>

<p>Have done, for more I hardly can endure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span></p>

<p>Descend to darkness and the burning lake!</p>

<p>False fiend, avoid!</p>

<p><center><i>[Thunder and lightning. Spirit exits, descending.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Duke of York and the Duke of Buckingham</p>

<p>with their Guard and Sir Humphrey Stafford, and</p>

<p>break in.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Guard arrest Margery Jourdain and her</p>

<p>accomplices and seize their papers.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Jourdain.]</i> Beldam, I think we watched you at an</p>

<p>inch.</p>

<p><i>[To the Duchess, aloft.]</i> What, madam, are you</p>

<p>there? The King and commonweal</p>

<p>Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains.</p>

<p>My Lord Protector will, I doubt it not,</p>

<p>See you well guerdoned for these good deserts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>Not half so bad as thine to England’s king,</p>

<p>Injurious duke, that threatest where’s no cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>True, madam, none at all. What call you this?</p>

<p><center><i>[He holds up the papers seized.]</i></center></p>

<p>Away with them! Let them be clapped up close</p>

<p>And kept asunder.–You, madam, shall with us.–</p>

<p>Stafford, take her to thee.     <i><i>[Stafford exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>We’ll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.</p>

<p>All away!     <i><i>[Jourdain, Southwell, and Bolingbroke</i></p>

<p>exit under guard, below; Duchess and Hume</p>

<p>exit, under guard, aloft.]</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Lord Buckingham, methinks you watched her well.</p>

<p>A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!</p>

<p>Now, pray, my lord, let’s see the devil’s writ.</p>

<p><center><i>[Buckingham hands him the papers.]</i></center></p>

<p>What have we here?</p>

<p><i>[(Reads.)]</i> The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose,</p>

<p>But him outlive and die a violent death.</p>

<p>Why, this is just Aio te, Aeacida,</p>

<p>Romanos vincere posse. Well, to the rest:</p>

<p><i>[(Reads.)]</i> Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of</p>

<p>Suffolk?</p>

<p>By water shall he die and take his end.</p>

<p>What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?</p>

<p>Let him shun castles;</p>

<p>Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains</p>

<p>Than where castles mounted stand.</p>

<p>Come, come, my lord, these oracles</p>

<p>Are hardly attained and hardly understood.</p>

<p>The King is now in progress towards Saint Albans;</p>

<p>With him the husband of this lovely lady.</p>

<p>Thither goes these news as fast as horse can carry</p>

<p>them–</p>

<p>A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>Your Grace shall give me leave, my lord of York,</p>

<p>To be the post, in hope of his reward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  At your pleasure, my good lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[Buckingham exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Who’s within there, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Servingman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Invite my lords of Salisbury and Warwick</p>

<p>To sup with me tomorrow night. Away!</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
