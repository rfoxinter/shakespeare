<p><center><i>[Flourish of trumpets, then hautboys.</p>

<p>Enter King Henry, Duke Humphrey of Gloucester,</p>

<p>Salisbury, Warwick, and Cardinal Beaufort, on the one</p>

<p>side; Queen Margaret, Suffolk, York, Somerset, and</p>

<p>Buckingham, on the other.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>As by your high imperial Majesty</p>

<p>I had in charge at my depart for France,</p>

<p>As procurator to your Excellence,</p>

<p>To marry Princess Margaret for your Grace,</p>

<p>So, in the famous ancient city Tours,</p>

<p>In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,</p>

<p>The Dukes of Orleance, Calaber, Britaigne, and</p>

<p>Alanson,</p>

<p>Seven earls, twelve barons, and twenty reverend</p>

<p>bishops,</p>

<p>I have performed my task and was espoused;</p>

<p><center><i>[He kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>And humbly now upon my bended knee,</p>

<p>In sight of England and her lordly peers,</p>

<p>Deliver up my title in the Queen</p>

<p>To your most gracious hands, that are the substance</p>

<p>Of that great shadow I did represent:</p>

<p>The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,</p>

<p>The fairest queen that ever king received.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Suffolk, arise.–Welcome, Queen Margaret.</p>

<p><center><i>[Suffolk rises.]</i></center></p>

<p>I can express no kinder sign of love</p>

<p>Than this kind kiss.     <i><i>[He kisses her.]</i></i></p>

<p>O Lord, that lends me life,</p>

<p>Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!</p>

<p>For Thou hast given me in this beauteous face</p>

<p>A world of earthly blessings to my soul,</p>

<p>If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Great king of England and my gracious lord,</p>

<p>The mutual conference that my mind hath had</p>

<p>By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,</p>

<p>In courtly company or at my beads,</p>

<p>With you, mine alderliefest sovereign,</p>

<p>Makes me the bolder to salute my king</p>

<p>With ruder terms, such as my wit affords</p>

<p>And overjoy of heart doth minister.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,</p>

<p>Her words yclad with wisdom’s majesty,</p>

<p>Makes me from wond’ring fall to weeping joys,</p>

<p>Such is the fullness of my heart’s content.</p>

<p>Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> <i>[kneel.]</i></p>

<p>Long live Queen Margaret, England’s happiness!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  We thank you all.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. All rise.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> <i>[to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>My Lord Protector, so it please your Grace,</p>

<p>Here are the articles of contracted peace</p>

<p>Between our sovereign and the French king Charles,</p>

<p>For eighteen months concluded by consent.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands Gloucester a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span> <i>[(reads)]</i>  Imprimis, it is agreed between the</p>

<p>French king Charles and William de la Pole, Marquess</p>

<p>of Suffolk, ambassador for Henry, King of England,</p>

<p>that the said Henry shall espouse the Lady</p>

<p>Margaret, daughter unto Reignier, King of Naples,</p>

<p>Sicilia, and Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England</p>

<p>ere the thirtieth of May next ensuing. Item,</p>

<p>that the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine</p>

<p>shall be released and delivered to the King her</p>

<p>father–     <i><i>[He drops the paper.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Uncle, how now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  Pardon me, gracious lord.</p>

<p>Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart</p>

<p>And dimmed mine eyes, that I can read no further.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Uncle of Winchester, I pray read on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cardinal</span> <i>[picks up the paper and reads]</i>  Item, it is further</p>

<p>agreed between them that the duchies of</p>

<p>Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered to</p>

<p>the King her father, and she sent over of the King of</p>

<p>England’s own proper cost and charges, without</p>

<p>having any dowry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>They please us well.–Lord Marquess, kneel down.</p>

<p><center><i>[Suffolk kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk</p>

<p>And girt thee with the sword. <i>[Suffolk rises.]</i> Cousin</p>

<p>of York,</p>

<p>We here discharge your Grace from being regent</p>

<p>I’ th’ parts of France till term of eighteen months</p>

<p>Be full expired.–Thanks, Uncle Winchester,</p>

<p>Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,</p>

<p>Salisbury, and Warwick;</p>

<p>We thank you all for this great favor done</p>

<p>In entertainment to my princely queen.</p>

<p>Come, let us in, and with all speed provide</p>

<p>To see her coronation be performed.</p>

<p><center><i>[King, Queen, and Suffolk exit.</p>

<p>The rest remain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,</p>

<p>To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,</p>

<p>Your grief, the common grief of all the land.</p>

<p>What, did my brother Henry spend his youth,</p>

<p>His valor, coin, and people in the wars?</p>

<p>Did he so often lodge in open field,</p>

<p>In winter’s cold and summer’s parching heat,</p>

<p>To conquer France, his true inheritance?</p>

<p>And did my brother Bedford toil his wits</p>

<p>To keep by policy what Henry got?</p>

<p>Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,</p>

<p>Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,</p>

<p>Received deep scars in France and Normandy?</p>

<p>Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,</p>

<p>With all the learned council of the realm,</p>

<p>Studied so long, sat in the Council House,</p>

<p>Early and late, debating to and fro</p>

<p>How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,</p>

<p>And had his Highness in his infancy</p>

<p>Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?</p>

<p>And shall these labors and these honors die?</p>

<p>Shall Henry’s conquest, Bedford’s vigilance,</p>

<p>Your deeds of war, and all our counsel die?</p>

<p>O peers of England, shameful is this league,</p>

<p>Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,</p>

<p>Blotting your names from books of memory,</p>

<p>Razing the characters of your renown,</p>

<p>Defacing monuments of conquered France,</p>

<p>Undoing all, as all had never been!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cardinal</span></p>

<p>Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,</p>

<p>This peroration with such circumstance?</p>

<p>For France, ’tis ours, and we will keep it still.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Ay, uncle, we will keep it if we can,</p>

<p>But now it is impossible we should.</p>

<p>Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,</p>

<p>Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine</p>

<p>Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style</p>

<p>Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Now, by the death of Him that died for all,</p>

<p>These counties were the keys of Normandy.</p>

<p>But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>For grief that they are past recovery;</p>

<p>For, were there hope to conquer them again,</p>

<p>My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no</p>

<p>tears.</p>

<p>Anjou and Maine? Myself did win them both!</p>

<p>Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer.</p>

<p>And are the cities that I got with wounds</p>

<p>Delivered up again with peaceful words?</p>

<p>Mort Dieu!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>For Suffolk’s duke, may he be suffocate</p>

<p>That dims the honor of this warlike isle!</p>

<p>France should have torn and rent my very heart</p>

<p>Before I would have yielded to this league.</p>

<p>I never read but England’s kings have had</p>

<p>Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives;</p>

<p>And our King Henry gives away his own</p>

<p>To match with her that brings no vantages.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>A proper jest, and never heard before,</p>

<p>That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth</p>

<p>For costs and charges in transporting her!</p>

<p>She should have stayed in France and starved in</p>

<p>France</p>

<p>Before–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cardinal</span></p>

<p>My lord of Gloucester, now you grow too hot.</p>

<p>It was the pleasure of my lord the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>My lord of Winchester, I know your mind.</p>

<p>’Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,</p>

<p>But ’tis my presence that doth trouble you.</p>

<p>Rancor will out. Proud prelate, in thy face</p>

<p>I see thy fury. If I longer stay,</p>

<p>We shall begin our ancient bickerings.–</p>

<p>Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,</p>

<p>I prophesied France will be lost ere long.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gloucester exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cardinal</span></p>

<p>So, there goes our Protector in a rage.</p>

<p>’Tis known to you he is mine enemy,</p>

<p>Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,</p>

<p>And no great friend, I fear me, to the King.</p>

<p>Consider, lords, he is the next of blood</p>

<p>And heir apparent to the English crown.</p>

<p>Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,</p>

<p>And all the wealthy kingdoms of the West,</p>

<p>There’s reason he should be displeased at it.</p>

<p>Look to it, lords. Let not his smoothing words</p>

<p>Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.</p>

<p>What though the common people favor him,</p>

<p>Calling him “Humphrey, the good Duke of</p>

<p>Gloucester,”</p>

<p>Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice</p>

<p>“Jesu maintain your royal Excellence!”</p>

<p>With “God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!”</p>

<p>I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,</p>

<p>He will be found a dangerous Protector.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,</p>

<p>He being of age to govern of himself?–</p>

<p>Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,</p>

<p>And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,</p>

<p>We’ll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cardinal</span></p>

<p>This weighty business will not brook delay.</p>

<p>I’ll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.     <i><i>[Cardinal exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey’s pride</p>

<p>And greatness of his place be grief to us,</p>

<p>Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal.</p>

<p>His insolence is more intolerable</p>

<p>Than all the princes’ in the land besides.</p>

<p>If Gloucester be displaced, he’ll be Protector.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>Or thou or I, Somerset, will be Protector,</p>

<p>Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal.</p>

<p><center><i>[Buckingham and Somerset exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Pride went before; Ambition follows him.</p>

<p>While these do labor for their own preferment,</p>

<p>Behooves it us to labor for the realm.</p>

<p>I never saw but Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,</p>

<p>Did bear him like a noble gentleman.</p>

<p>Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,</p>

<p>More like a soldier than a man o’ th’ Church,</p>

<p>As stout and proud as he were lord of all,</p>

<p>Swear like a ruffian and demean himself</p>

<p>Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.–</p>

<p>Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,</p>

<p>Thy deeds, thy plainness, and thy housekeeping</p>

<p>Hath won the greatest favor of the Commons,</p>

<p>Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey.–</p>

<p>And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,</p>

<p>In bringing them to civil discipline,</p>

<p>Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,</p>

<p>When thou wert regent for our sovereign,</p>

<p>Have made thee feared and honored of the people.</p>

<p>Join we together for the public good</p>

<p>In what we can to bridle and suppress</p>

<p>The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal,</p>

<p>With Somerset’s and Buckingham’s ambition;</p>

<p>And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey’s deeds</p>

<p>While they do tend the profit of the land.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>So God help Warwick, as he loves the land</p>

<p>And common profit of his country!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>And so says York–<i>[aside]</i> for he hath greatest</p>

<p>cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>Then let’s make haste away and look unto the main.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Unto the main? O father, Maine is lost!</p>

<p>That Maine which by main force Warwick did win</p>

<p>And would have kept so long as breath did last!</p>

<p>Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,</p>

<p>Which I will win from France or else be slain.</p>

<p><center><i>[Warwick and Salisbury exit.</p>

<p>York remains.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Anjou and Maine are given to the French;</p>

<p>Paris is lost; the state of Normandy</p>

<p>Stands on a tickle point now they are gone.</p>

<p>Suffolk concluded on the articles,</p>

<p>The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased</p>

<p>To change two dukedoms for a duke’s fair daughter.</p>

<p>I cannot blame them all. What is ’t to them?</p>

<p>’Tis thine they give away, and not their own.</p>

<p>Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their</p>

<p>pillage,</p>

<p>And purchase friends, and give to courtesans,</p>

<p>Still reveling like lords till all be gone;</p>

<p>Whileas the silly owner of the goods</p>

<p>Weeps over them, and wrings his hapless hands,</p>

<p>And shakes his head, and trembling stands aloof,</p>

<p>While all is shared and all is borne away,</p>

<p>Ready to starve, and dare not touch his own.</p>

<p>So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue</p>

<p>While his own lands are bargained for and sold.</p>

<p>Methinks the realms of England, France, and</p>

<p>Ireland</p>

<p>Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood</p>

<p>As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt</p>

<p>Unto the Prince’s heart of Calydon.</p>

<p>Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!</p>

<p>Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,</p>

<p>Even as I have of fertile England’s soil.</p>

<p>A day will come when York shall claim his own;</p>

<p>And therefore I will take the Nevilles’ parts</p>

<p>And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,</p>

<p>And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,</p>

<p>For that’s the golden mark I seek to hit.</p>

<p>Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,</p>

<p>Nor hold the scepter in his childish fist,</p>

<p>Nor wear the diadem upon his head,</p>

<p>Whose churchlike humors fits not for a crown.</p>

<p>Then, York, be still awhile till time do serve.</p>

<p>Watch thou and wake, when others be asleep,</p>

<p>To pry into the secrets of the state</p>

<p>Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love</p>

<p>With his new bride and England’s dear-bought</p>

<p>queen,</p>

<p>And Humphrey with the peers be fall’n at jars.</p>

<p>Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,</p>

<p>With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed,</p>

<p>And in my standard bear the arms of York,</p>

<p>To grapple with the house of Lancaster;</p>

<p>And force perforce I’ll make him yield the crown,</p>

<p>Whose bookish rule hath pulled fair England down.</p>
