<p><center><i>[Enter Duke Humphrey of Gloucester and his Men,</p>

<p>in mourning cloaks.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud,</p>

<p>And after summer evermore succeeds</p>

<p>Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold;</p>

<p>So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.</p>

<p>Sirs, what’s o’clock?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc>  Ten, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Ten is the hour that was appointed me</p>

<p>To watch the coming of my punished duchess.</p>

<p>Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,</p>

<p>To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.</p>

<p>Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook</p>

<p>The abject people gazing on thy face</p>

<p>With envious looks laughing at thy shame,</p>

<p>That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels</p>

<p>When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.</p>

<p>But, soft! I think she comes, and I’ll prepare</p>

<p>My tearstained eyes to see her miseries.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Duchess of Gloucester, barefoot, and in a</p>

<p>white sheet, with papers pinned to her back and a</p>

<p>taper burning in her hand, with Sir John Stanley,</p>

<p>the Sheriff, and Officers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>So please your Grace, we’ll take her from the Sheriff.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>No, stir not for your lives. Let her pass by.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?</p>

<p>Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!</p>

<p>See how the giddy multitude do point,</p>

<p>And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee.</p>

<p>Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,</p>

<p>And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,</p>

<p>And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Be patient, gentle Nell. Forget this grief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!</p>

<p>For whilst I think I am thy married wife</p>

<p>And thou a prince, Protector of this land,</p>

<p>Methinks I should not thus be led along,</p>

<p>Mailed up in shame, with papers on my back,</p>

<p>And followed with a rabble that rejoice</p>

<p>To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.</p>

<p>The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,</p>

<p>And when I start, the envious people laugh</p>

<p>And bid me be advised how I tread.</p>

<p>Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?</p>

<p>Trowest thou that e’er I’ll look upon the world</p>

<p>Or count them happy that enjoys the sun?</p>

<p>No, dark shall be my light, and night my day.</p>

<p>To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’ll say I am Duke Humphrey’s wife</p>

<p>And he a prince and ruler of the land;</p>

<p>Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was</p>

<p>As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,</p>

<p>Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock</p>

<p>To every idle rascal follower.</p>

<p>But be thou mild, and blush not at my shame,</p>

<p>Nor stir at nothing till the ax of death</p>

<p>Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will.</p>

<p>For Suffolk, he that can do all in all</p>

<p>With her that hateth thee and hates us all,</p>

<p>And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,</p>

<p>Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings;</p>

<p>And fly thou how thou canst, they’ll tangle thee.</p>

<p>But fear not thou until thy foot be snared,</p>

<p>Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Ah, Nell, forbear. Thou aimest all awry.</p>

<p>I must offend before I be attainted;</p>

<p>And had I twenty times so many foes,</p>

<p>And each of them had twenty times their power,</p>

<p>All these could not procure me any scathe</p>

<p>So long as I am loyal, true, and crimeless.</p>

<p>Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?</p>

<p>Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away,</p>

<p>But I in danger for the breach of law.</p>

<p>Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell.</p>

<p>I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience;</p>

<p>These few days’ wonder will be quickly worn.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Herald.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Herald</sc></p>

<p>I summon your Grace to his Majesty’s Parliament</p>

<p>Holden at Bury the first of this next month.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>And my consent ne’er asked herein before?</p>

<p>This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.</p>

<p><center><i>[Herald exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>My Nell, I take my leave.–And, master sheriff,</p>

<p>Let not her penance exceed the King’s commission.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sheriff</sc></p>

<p>An ’t please your Grace, here my commission stays,</p>

<p>And Sir John Stanley is appointed now</p>

<p>To take her with him to the Isle of Man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>So am I given in charge, may ’t please your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Entreat her not the worse in that I pray</p>

<p>You use her well. The world may laugh again,</p>

<p>And I may live to do you kindness, if</p>

<p>You do it her. And so, Sir John, farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Witness my tears. I cannot stay to speak.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gloucester exits with his Men.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Art thou gone too? All comfort go with thee,</p>

<p>For none abides with me. My joy is death–</p>

<p>Death, at whose name I oft have been afeard,</p>

<p>Because I wished this world’s eternity.–</p>

<p>Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence.</p>

<p>I care not whither, for I beg no favor;</p>

<p>Only convey me where thou art commanded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man,</p>

<p>There to be used according to your state.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>That’s bad enough, for I am but reproach.</p>

<p>And shall I, then, be used reproachfully?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>Like to a duchess and Duke Humphrey’s lady;</p>

<p>According to that state you shall be used.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,</p>

<p>Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sheriff</sc></p>

<p>It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>Ay, ay, farewell. Thy office is discharged.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Sheriff and Officers exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Come, Stanley, shall we go?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Stanley</sc></p>

<p>Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,</p>

<p>And go we to attire you for our journey.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duchess</sc></p>

<p>My shame will not be shifted with my sheet.</p>

<p>No, it will hang upon my richest robes</p>

<p>And show itself, attire me how I can.</p>

<p>Go, lead the way. I long to see my prison.</p>
