<p><center><i>[Sound trumpets. Enter King Henry and State</p>

<p>(Queen Margaret, Gloucester, York, Salisbury, Suffolk,</p>

<p>and Others) with Guard, to banish the Duchess of</p>

<p>Gloucester, who is accompanied by Margery Jourdain,</p>

<p>Southwell, Hume, and Bolingbroke, all guarded.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester’s</p>

<p>wife.</p>

<p>In sight of God and us, your guilt is great.</p>

<p>Receive the sentence of the law for sins</p>

<p>Such as by God’s book are adjudged to death.</p>

<p><center><i>[To Jourdain, Southwell, Hume, and Bolingbroke.]</i></center></p>

<p>You four, from hence to prison back again;</p>

<p>From thence unto the place of execution:</p>

<p>The witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes,</p>

<p>And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.</p>

<p><i>[To Duchess]</i> You, madam, for you are more nobly</p>

<p>born,</p>

<p>Despoiled of your honor in your life,</p>

<p>Shall, after three days’ open penance done,</p>

<p>Live in your country here in banishment</p>

<p>With Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Duchess</span></p>

<p>Welcome is banishment. Welcome were my death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Eleanor, the law, thou seest, hath judged thee.</p>

<p>I cannot justify whom the law condemns.</p>

<p><center><i>[Duchess and the other prisoners exit under guard.]</i></center></p>

<p>Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.</p>

<p>Ah, Humphrey, this dishonor in thine age</p>

<p>Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground.–</p>

<p>I beseech your Majesty give me leave to go;</p>

<p>Sorrow would solace, and mine age would ease.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Stay, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. Ere thou go,</p>

<p>Give up thy staff. Henry will to himself</p>

<p>Protector be; and God shall be my hope,</p>

<p>My stay, my guide, and lantern to my feet.</p>

<p>And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved</p>

<p>Than when thou wert Protector to thy king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>I see no reason why a king of years</p>

<p>Should be to be protected like a child.</p>

<p>God and King Henry govern England’s realm!–</p>

<p>Give up your staff, sir, and the King his realm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>My staff?–Here, noble Henry, is my staff.</p>

<p><center><i>[He puts down his staff before Henry.]</i></center></p>

<p>As willingly do I the same resign</p>

<p>As e’er thy father Henry made it mine;</p>

<p>And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it</p>

<p>As others would ambitiously receive it.</p>

<p>Farewell, good king. When I am dead and gone,</p>

<p>May honorable peace attend thy throne.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gloucester exits.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Henry picks up the staff.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Why, now is Henry king and Margaret queen,</p>

<p>And Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, scarce himself,</p>

<p>That bears so shrewd a maim. Two pulls at once:</p>

<p>His lady banished and a limb lopped off.</p>

<p>This staff of honor raught, there let it stand</p>

<p>Where it best fits to be, in Henry’s hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;</p>

<p>Thus Eleanor’s pride dies in her youngest days.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Lords, let him go.–Please it your Majesty,</p>

<p>This is the day appointed for the combat,</p>

<p>And ready are the appellant and defendant–</p>

<p>The armorer and his man–to enter the lists,</p>

<p>So please your Highness to behold the fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Ay, good my lord, for purposely therefor</p>

<p>Left I the court to see this quarrel tried.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>I’ God’s name, see the lists and all things fit.</p>

<p>Here let them end it, and God defend the right!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>I never saw a fellow worse bestead</p>

<p>Or more afraid to fight than is the appellant,</p>

<p>The servant of this armorer, my lords.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter at one door the Armorer Horner and his</p>

<p>Neighbors, drinking to him so much that he is drunk;</p>

<p>and he enters with a Drum before him and his staff with</p>

<p>a sandbag fastened to it; and at the other door his man</p>

<p>Peter, with a Drum and sandbag, and Prentices</p>

<p>drinking to him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Neighbor</span>  Here, neighbor Horner, I drink to you</p>

<p>in a cup of sack; and fear not, neighbor, you shall</p>

<p>do well enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Neighbor</span>  And here, neighbor, here’s a cup of</p>

<p>charneco.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Third</span> <span class='sc'>Neighbor</span>  And here’s a pot of good double beer,</p>

<p>neighbor. Drink, and fear not your man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horner</span>  Let it come, i’ faith, and I’ll pledge you all.</p>

<p>And a fig for Peter!     <i><i>[They drink.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Prentice</span>  Here, Peter, I drink to thee, and be not</p>

<p>afraid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Prentice</span>  Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy</p>

<p>master. Fight for credit of the prentices.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  I thank you all. Drink, and pray for me, I pray</p>

<p>you, for I think I have taken my last draft in this</p>

<p>world. Here, Robin, an if I die, I give thee my</p>

<p>apron.–And, Will, thou shalt have my hammer.–</p>

<p>And here, Tom, take all the money that I have. <i>[He</p>

<p>distributes his possessions.]</i> O Lord, bless me, I</p>

<p>pray God, for I am never able to deal with my</p>

<p>master. He hath learnt so much fence already.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span>  Come, leave your drinking, and fall to</p>

<p>blows. Sirrah, what’s thy name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  Peter, forsooth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span>  Peter? What more?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  Thump.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span>  Thump? Then see thou thump thy master</p>

<p>well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horner</span>  Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon</p>

<p>my man’s instigation, to prove him a knave and</p>

<p>myself an honest man; and touching the Duke of</p>

<p>York, I will take my death I never meant him any</p>

<p>ill, nor the King, nor the Queen.–And therefore,</p>

<p>Peter, have at thee with a downright blow!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  Dispatch. This knave’s tongue begins to double.</p>

<p>Sound, trumpets. Alarum to the combatants!</p>

<p><center><i>[Trumpet sounds.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[They fight, and Peter strikes him down.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horner</span>  Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.</p>

<p><center><i>[He dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  Take away his weapon.–Fellow, thank God and</p>

<p>the good wine in thy master’s way.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peter</span>  O God, have I overcome mine enemies in this</p>

<p>presence? O Peter, thou hast prevailed in right!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Go, take hence that traitor from our sight;</p>

<p>For by his death we do perceive his guilt.</p>

<p>And God in justice hath revealed to us</p>

<p>The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,</p>

<p>Which he had thought to have murdered</p>

<p>wrongfully.–</p>

<p>Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sound a flourish. They exit, bearing Horner’s body.]</i></center></p>
