<p><center><i>[Enter York, Salisbury, and Warwick.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Now, my good lords of Salisbury and Warwick,</p>

<p>Our simple supper ended, give me leave,</p>

<p>In this close walk, to satisfy myself</p>

<p>In craving your opinion of my title,</p>

<p>Which is infallible, to England’s crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I long to hear it at full.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good,</p>

<p>The Nevilles are thy subjects to command.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc>  Then thus:</p>

<p>Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:</p>

<p>The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;</p>

<p>The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,</p>

<p>Lionel, Duke of Clarence; next to whom</p>

<p>Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;</p>

<p>The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;</p>

<p>The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of</p>

<p>Gloucester;</p>

<p>William of Windsor was the seventh and last.</p>

<p>Edward the Black Prince died before his father</p>

<p>And left behind him Richard, his only son,</p>

<p>Who, after Edward the Third’s death, reigned as</p>

<p>king</p>

<p>Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,</p>

<p>The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,</p>

<p>Crowned by the name of Henry the Fourth,</p>

<p>Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,</p>

<p>Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she</p>

<p>came,</p>

<p>And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,</p>

<p>Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc>  Father, the Duke hath told the truth.</p>

<p>Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>Which now they hold by force and not by right;</p>

<p>For Richard, the first son’s heir, being dead,</p>

<p>The issue of the next son should have reigned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>But William of Hatfield died without an heir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line</p>

<p>I claim the crown, had issue, Philippa, a daughter,</p>

<p>Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.</p>

<p>Edmund had issue, Roger, Earl of March;</p>

<p>Roger had issue: Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,</p>

<p>As I have read, laid claim unto the crown</p>

<p>And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,</p>

<p>Who kept him in captivity till he died.</p>

<p>But to the rest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc>  His eldest sister, Anne,</p>

<p>My mother, being heir unto the crown,</p>

<p>Married Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who was son</p>

<p>To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third’s fifth son.</p>

<p>By her I claim the kingdom. She was heir</p>

<p>To Roger, Earl of March, who was the son</p>

<p>Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippa,</p>

<p>Sole daughter unto Lionel, Duke of Clarence.</p>

<p>So, if the issue of the elder son</p>

<p>Succeed before the younger, I am king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>What plain proceedings is more plain than this?</p>

<p>Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,</p>

<p>The fourth son; York claims it from the third.</p>

<p>Till Lionel’s issue fails, his should not reign.</p>

<p>It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee</p>

<p>And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.</p>

<p>Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,</p>

<p>And in this private plot be we the first</p>

<p>That shall salute our rightful sovereign</p>

<p>With honor of his birthright to the crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc> <sc>Warwick</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Long live our sovereign Richard, England’s king!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>We thank you, lords. <i>[They rise.]</i> But I am not your</p>

<p>king</p>

<p>Till I be crowned, and that my sword be stained</p>

<p>With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;</p>

<p>And that’s not suddenly to be performed,</p>

<p>But with advice and silent secrecy.</p>

<p>Do you as I do in these dangerous days:</p>

<p>Wink at the Duke of Suffolk’s insolence,</p>

<p>At Beaufort’s pride, at Somerset’s ambition,</p>

<p>At Buckingham, and all the crew of them,</p>

<p>Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,</p>

<p>That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey.</p>

<p>’Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that,</p>

<p>Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Salisbury</sc></p>

<p>My lord, break we off. We know your mind at full.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Warwick</sc></p>

<p>My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick</p>

<p>Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>York</sc></p>

<p>And, Neville, this I do assure myself:</p>

<p>Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick</p>

<p>The greatest man in England but the King.</p>
