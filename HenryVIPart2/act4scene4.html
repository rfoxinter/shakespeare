<p><center><i>[Enter King Henry, with a supplication, and</p>

<p>Queen Margaret with Suffolk’s head, the Duke</p>

<p>of Buckingham, and the Lord Saye.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind</p>

<p>And makes it fearful and degenerate.</p>

<p>Think therefore on revenge, and cease to weep.</p>

<p>But who can cease to weep and look on this?</p>

<p>Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast,</p>

<p>But where’s the body that I should embrace?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc> <i>[to King Henry]</i></p>

<p>What answer makes your Grace to the rebels’</p>

<p>supplication?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>I’ll send some holy bishop to entreat,</p>

<p>For God forbid so many simple souls</p>

<p>Should perish by the sword! And I myself,</p>

<p>Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,</p>

<p>Will parley with Jack Cade, their general.</p>

<p>But stay, I’ll read it over once again.     <i><i>[He reads.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Ah, barbarous villains! Hath this lovely face</p>

<p>Ruled, like a wandering planet, over me,</p>

<p>And could it not enforce them to relent</p>

<p>That were unworthy to behold the same?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Lord Saye, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc></p>

<p>Ay, but I hope your Highness shall have his.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  How now, madam?</p>

<p>Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk’s death?</p>

<p>I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,</p>

<p>Thou wouldst not have mourned so much for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>How now, what news? Why com’st thou in such</p>

<p>haste?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>The rebels are in Southwark. Fly, my lord!</p>

<p>Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,</p>

<p>Descended from the Duke of Clarence’ house,</p>

<p>And calls your Grace usurper, openly,</p>

<p>And vows to crown himself in Westminster.</p>

<p>His army is a ragged multitude</p>

<p>Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless.</p>

<p>Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother’s death</p>

<p>Hath given them heart and courage to proceed.</p>

<p>All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen</p>

<p>They call false caterpillars and intend their death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>O, graceless men, they know not what they do!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>My gracious lord, retire to Killingworth</p>

<p>Until a power be raised to put them down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,</p>

<p>These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc>  Lord Saye, the traitors hateth thee;</p>

<p>Therefore away with us to Killingworth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc></p>

<p>So might your Grace’s person be in danger.</p>

<p>The sight of me is odious in their eyes;</p>

<p>And therefore in this city will I stay</p>

<p>And live alone as secret as I may.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter another Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Jack Cade hath gotten London Bridge.</p>

<p>The citizens fly and forsake their houses.</p>

<p>The rascal people, thirsting after prey,</p>

<p>Join with the traitor, and they jointly swear</p>

<p>To spoil the city and your royal court.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Then linger not, my lord. Away! Take horse!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc></p>

<p>Come, Margaret. God, our hope, will succor us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc> <sc>Margaret</sc></p>

<p>My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <sc>Henry</sc> <i>[to Saye]</i></p>

<p>Farewell, my lord. Trust not the Kentish rebels.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Buckingham</sc></p>

<p>Trust nobody, for fear you be betrayed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Saye</sc></p>

<p>The trust I have is in mine innocence,</p>

<p>And therefore am I bold and resolute.</p>
