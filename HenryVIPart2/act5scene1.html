<p><center><i>[Enter York, wearing the white rose, and his army of</p>

<p>Irish, with Attendants, Drum and Colors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right</p>

<p>And pluck the crown from feeble Henry’s head.</p>

<p>Ring, bells, aloud! Burn, bonfires, clear and bright</p>

<p>To entertain great England’s lawful king!</p>

<p>Ah, sancta maiestas, who would not buy thee dear?</p>

<p>Let them obey that knows not how to rule.</p>

<p>This hand was made to handle naught but gold.</p>

<p>I cannot give due action to my words</p>

<p>Except a sword or scepter balance it.</p>

<p>A scepter shall it have, have I a soul,</p>

<p>On which I’ll toss the fleur-de-luce of France.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Buckingham, wearing the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> Whom have we here? Buckingham, to</p>

<p>disturb me?</p>

<p>The King hath sent him, sure. I must dissemble.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.</p>

<p>Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,</p>

<p>To know the reason of these arms in peace;</p>

<p>Or why thou, being a subject as I am,</p>

<p>Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,</p>

<p>Should raise so great a power without his leave,</p>

<p>Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great.</p>

<p>O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,</p>

<p>I am so angry at these abject terms!</p>

<p>And now, like Ajax Telamonius,</p>

<p>On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.</p>

<p>I am far better born than is the King,</p>

<p>More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts.</p>

<p>But I must make fair weather yet awhile,</p>

<p>Till Henry be more weak and I more strong.–</p>

<p>Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,</p>

<p>That I have given no answer all this while.</p>

<p>My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.</p>

<p>The cause why I have brought this army hither</p>

<p>Is to remove proud Somerset from the King,</p>

<p>Seditious to his Grace and to the state.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>That is too much presumption on thy part.</p>

<p>But if thy arms be to no other end,</p>

<p>The King hath yielded unto thy demand:</p>

<p>The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Upon thine honor, is he prisoner?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>Upon mine honor, he is prisoner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.–</p>

<p>Soldiers, I thank you all. Disperse yourselves.</p>

<p>Meet me tomorrow in Saint George’s field;</p>

<p>You shall have pay and everything you wish.</p>

<p><center><i>[Soldiers exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,</p>

<p>Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,</p>

<p>As pledges of my fealty and love;</p>

<p>I’ll send them all as willing as I live.</p>

<p>Lands, goods, horse, armor, anything I have</p>

<p>Is his to use, so Somerset may die.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>York, I commend this kind submission.</p>

<p>We twain will go into his Highness’ tent.</p>

<p><center><i>[They walk arm in arm.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King Henry and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us</p>

<p>That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>In all submission and humility</p>

<p>York doth present himself unto your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>To heave the traitor Somerset from hence</p>

<p>And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,</p>

<p>Who since I heard to be discomfited.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Iden, with Cade’s head.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iden</span></p>

<p>If one so rude and of so mean condition</p>

<p>May pass into the presence of a king,</p>

<p>Lo, I present your Grace a traitor’s head,</p>

<p>The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>The head of Cade? Great God, how just art Thou!</p>

<p>O, let me view his visage, being dead,</p>

<p>That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.</p>

<p>Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iden</span>  I was, an ’t like your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>How art thou called? And what is thy degree?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iden</span></p>

<p>Alexander Iden, that’s my name,</p>

<p>A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Buckingham</span></p>

<p>So please it you, my lord, ’twere not amiss</p>

<p>He were created knight for his good service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Iden, kneel down. <i>[He kneels.]</i> Rise up a knight. <i>[He</p>

<p>rises.]</i></p>

<p>We give thee for reward a thousand marks,</p>

<p>And will that thou henceforth attend on us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iden</span></p>

<p>May Iden live to merit such a bounty,</p>

<p>And never live but true unto his liege!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Queen Margaret and Somerset,</p>

<p>wearing the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[aside to Buckingham]</i></p>

<p>See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with th’ Queen.</p>

<p>Go bid her hide him quickly from the Duke.</p>

<p><center><i>[Buckingham whispers to the Queen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,</p>

<p>But boldly stand and front him to his face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>How now? Is Somerset at liberty?</p>

<p>Then, York, unloose thy long-imprisoned thoughts,</p>

<p>And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.</p>

<p>Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?–</p>

<p>False king, why hast thou broken faith with me,</p>

<p>Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?</p>

<p>“King” did I call thee? No, thou art not king,</p>

<p>Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,</p>

<p>Which dar’st not–no, nor canst not–rule a traitor.</p>

<p>That head of thine doth not become a crown;</p>

<p>Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer’s staff,</p>

<p>And not to grace an awful princely scepter.</p>

<p>That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,</p>

<p>Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles’ spear,</p>

<p>Is able with the change to kill and cure.</p>

<p>Here is a hand to hold a scepter up</p>

<p>And with the same to act controlling laws.</p>

<p>Give place. By heaven, thou shalt rule no more</p>

<p>O’er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,</p>

<p>Of capital treason ’gainst the King and crown.</p>

<p>Obey, audacious traitor. Kneel for grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Wouldst have me kneel? First let me ask of these</p>

<p>If they can brook I bow a knee to man.</p>

<p><i>[To an Attendant.]</i> Sirrah, call in my sons to be my</p>

<p>bail.     <i><i>[Attendant exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>I know, ere they will have me go to ward,</p>

<p>They’ll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span> <i>[to Buckingham]</i></p>

<p>Call hither Clifford; bid him come amain,</p>

<p>To say if that the bastard boys of York</p>

<p>Shall be the surety for their traitor father.</p>

<p><center><i>[Buckingham exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span> <i>[to Queen Margaret]</i></p>

<p>O, blood-bespotted Neapolitan,</p>

<p>Outcast of Naples, England’s bloody scourge!</p>

<p>The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,</p>

<p>Shall be their father’s bail, and bane to those</p>

<p>That for my surety will refuse the boys.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter York’s sons Edward and Richard,</p>

<p>wearing the white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>See where they come; I’ll warrant they’ll make it</p>

<p>good.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter old Clifford and his Son, wearing the red rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span> <i>[kneeling before King Henry]</i></p>

<p>Health and all happiness to my lord the King.</p>

<p><center><i>[He rises.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>I thank thee, Clifford. Say, what news with thee?</p>

<p>Nay, do not fright us with an angry look.</p>

<p>We are thy sovereign, Clifford; kneel again.</p>

<p>For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>This is my king, York; I do not mistake,</p>

<p>But thou mistakes me much to think I do.–</p>

<p>To Bedlam with him! Is the man grown mad?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Ay, Clifford, a bedlam and ambitious humor</p>

<p>Makes him oppose himself against his king.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>He is a traitor. Let him to the Tower,</p>

<p>And chop away that factious pate of his.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>He is arrested, but will not obey.</p>

<p>His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span>  Will you not, sons?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edward</span></p>

<p>Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>And if words will not, then our weapons shall.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Look in a glass, and call thy image so.</p>

<p>I am thy king and thou a false-heart traitor.</p>

<p>Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,</p>

<p>That, with the very shaking of their chains,</p>

<p>They may astonish these fell-lurking curs.</p>

<p><i>[To an Attendant.]</i> Bid Salisbury and Warwick come</p>

<p>to me.     <i><i>[Attendant exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Earls of Warwick and Salisbury, wearing the</p>

<p>white rose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>Are these thy bears? We’ll bait thy bears to death</p>

<p>And manacle the bearherd in their chains,</p>

<p>If thou dar’st bring them to the baiting place.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Oft have I seen a hot o’erweening cur</p>

<p>Run back and bite because he was withheld,</p>

<p>Who, being suffered with the bear’s fell paw,</p>

<p>Hath clapped his tail between his legs and cried;</p>

<p>And such a piece of service will you do</p>

<p>If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,</p>

<p>As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span></p>

<p>Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?–</p>

<p>Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,</p>

<p>Thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son!</p>

<p>What, wilt thou on thy deathbed play the ruffian</p>

<p>And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?</p>

<p>O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?</p>

<p>If it be banished from the frosty head,</p>

<p>Where shall it find a harbor in the earth?</p>

<p>Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,</p>

<p>And shame thine honorable age with blood?</p>

<p>Why art thou old and want’st experience?</p>

<p>Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?</p>

<p>For shame! In duty bend thy knee to me</p>

<p>That bows unto the grave with mickle age.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>My lord, I have considered with myself</p>

<p>The title of this most renowned duke,</p>

<p>And in my conscience do repute his Grace</p>

<p>The rightful heir to England’s royal seat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span>  I have.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Salisbury</span></p>

<p>It is great sin to swear unto a sin,</p>

<p>But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.</p>

<p>Who can be bound by any solemn vow</p>

<p>To do a murd’rous deed, to rob a man,</p>

<p>To force a spotless virgin’s chastity,</p>

<p>To reave the orphan of his patrimony,</p>

<p>To wring the widow from her customed right,</p>

<p>And have no other reason for this wrong</p>

<p>But that he was bound by a solemn oath?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>A subtle traitor needs no sophister.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span> <i>[to an Attendant]</i></p>

<p>Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.</p>

<p><center><i>[Attendant exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>York</span> <i>[to King Henry]</i></p>

<p>Call Buckingham and all the friends thou hast,</p>

<p>I am resolved for death or dignity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>The first, I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>You were best to go to bed and dream again,</p>

<p>To keep thee from the tempest of the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>I am resolved to bear a greater storm</p>

<p>Than any thou canst conjure up today;</p>

<p>And that I’ll write upon thy burgonet,</p>

<p>Might I but know thee by thy house’s badge.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Now, by my father’s badge, old Neville’s crest,</p>

<p>The rampant bear chained to the ragged staff,</p>

<p>This day I’ll wear aloft my burgonet–</p>

<p>As on a mountaintop the cedar shows</p>

<p>That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm–</p>

<p>Even to affright thee with the view thereof.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>And from thy burgonet I’ll rend thy bear</p>

<p>And tread it under foot with all contempt,</p>

<p>Despite the bearherd that protects the bear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>And so to arms, victorious father,</p>

<p>To quell the rebels and their complices.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>Fie! Charity, for shame! Speak not in spite,</p>

<p>For you shall sup with Jesu Christ tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Young</span> <span class='sc'>Clifford</span></p>

<p>Foul stigmatic, that’s more than thou canst tell!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Richard</span></p>

<p>If not in heaven, you’ll surely sup in hell.</p>
