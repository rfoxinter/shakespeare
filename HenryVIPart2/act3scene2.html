<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>Run to my lord of Suffolk. Let him know</p>

<p>We have dispatched the Duke as he commanded.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Second</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span></p>

<p>O, that it were to do! What have we done?</p>

<p>Didst ever hear a man so penitent?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Suffolk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Here comes my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  Now, sirs, have you dispatched this thing?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  Ay, my good lord, he’s dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Why, that’s well said. Go, get you to my house;</p>

<p>I will reward you for this venturous deed.</p>

<p>The King and all the peers are here at hand.</p>

<p>Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,</p>

<p>According as I gave directions?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Murderer</span>  ’Tis, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  Away, be gone.     <i><i>[The Murderers exit.]</i></i></p>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Go, call our uncle to our presence straight.</p>

<p>Say we intend to try his Grace today</p>

<p>If he be guilty, as ’tis published.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>I’ll call him presently, my noble lord.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,</p>

<p>Proceed no straiter ’gainst our uncle Gloucester</p>

<p>Than from true evidence of good esteem</p>

<p>He be approved in practice culpable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>God forbid any malice should prevail</p>

<p>That faultless may condemn a nobleman!</p>

<p>Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>I thank thee, Meg. These words content me much.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Suffolk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now? Why look’st thou pale? Why tremblest</p>

<p>thou?</p>

<p>Where is our uncle? What’s the matter, Suffolk?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Dead in his bed, my lord. Gloucester is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Marry, God forfend!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cardinal</span></p>

<p>God’s secret judgment. I did dream tonight</p>

<p>The Duke was dumb and could not speak a word.</p>

<p><center><i>[King Henry swoons.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>How fares my lord? Help, lords, the King is dead!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Somerset</span></p>

<p>Rear up his body. Wring him by the nose.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!</p>

<p><center><i>[King Henry stirs.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>He doth revive again. Madam, be patient.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>O heavenly God!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  How fares my gracious lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Comfort, my sovereign! Gracious Henry, comfort!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>What, doth my lord of Suffolk comfort me?</p>

<p>Came he right now to sing a raven’s note,</p>

<p>Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers,</p>

<p>And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,</p>

<p>By crying comfort from a hollow breast,</p>

<p>Can chase away the first-conceived sound?</p>

<p>Hide not thy poison with such sugared words.</p>

<p>Lay not thy hands on me. Forbear, I say!</p>

<p>Their touch affrights me as a serpent’s sting.</p>

<p>Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!</p>

<p>Upon thy eyeballs, murderous Tyranny</p>

<p>Sits in grim majesty to fright the world.</p>

<p>Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding.</p>

<p>Yet do not go away. Come, basilisk,</p>

<p>And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;</p>

<p>For in the shade of death I shall find joy,</p>

<p>In life but double death, now Gloucester’s dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Why do you rate my lord of Suffolk thus?</p>

<p>Although the Duke was enemy to him,</p>

<p>Yet he most Christian-like laments his death.</p>

<p>And for myself, foe as he was to me,</p>

<p>Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans</p>

<p>Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,</p>

<p>I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,</p>

<p>Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,</p>

<p>And all to have the noble duke alive.</p>

<p>What know I how the world may deem of me?</p>

<p>For it is known we were but hollow friends.</p>

<p>It may be judged I made the Duke away;</p>

<p>So shall my name with slander’s tongue be wounded</p>

<p>And princes’ courts be filled with my reproach.</p>

<p>This get I by his death. Ay me, unhappy,</p>

<p>To be a queen and crowned with infamy!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.</p>

<p>What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?</p>

<p>I am no loathsome leper. Look on me.</p>

<p>What, art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?</p>

<p>Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn queen.</p>

<p>Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester’s tomb?</p>

<p>Why, then, Dame Margaret was ne’er thy joy.</p>

<p>Erect his statue and worship it,</p>

<p>And make my image but an alehouse sign.</p>

<p>Was I for this nigh-wracked upon the sea</p>

<p>And twice by awkward wind from England’s bank</p>

<p>Drove back again unto my native clime?</p>

<p>What boded this, but well forewarning wind</p>

<p>Did seem to say “Seek not a scorpion’s nest,</p>

<p>Nor set no footing on this unkind shore”?</p>

<p>What did I then but cursed the gentle gusts</p>

<p>And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves</p>

<p>And bid them blow towards England’s blessed shore</p>

<p>Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?</p>

<p>Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,</p>

<p>But left that hateful office unto thee.</p>

<p>The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,</p>

<p>Knowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on</p>

<p>shore</p>

<p>With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness.</p>

<p>The splitting rocks cow’red in the sinking sands</p>

<p>And would not dash me with their ragged sides</p>

<p>Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,</p>

<p>Might in thy palace perish Margaret.</p>

<p>As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,</p>

<p>When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,</p>

<p>I stood upon the hatches in the storm,</p>

<p>And when the dusky sky began to rob</p>

<p>My earnest-gaping sight of thy land’s view,</p>

<p>I took a costly jewel from my neck–</p>

<p>A heart it was, bound in with diamonds–</p>

<p>And threw it towards thy land. The sea received it,</p>

<p>And so I wished thy body might my heart.</p>

<p>And even with this I lost fair England’s view,</p>

<p>And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,</p>

<p>And called them blind and dusky spectacles</p>

<p>For losing ken of Albion’s wished coast.</p>

<p>How often have I tempted Suffolk’s tongue,</p>

<p>The agent of thy foul inconstancy,</p>

<p>To sit and watch me, as Ascanius did</p>

<p>When he to madding Dido would unfold</p>

<p>His father’s acts commenced in burning Troy!</p>

<p>Am I not witched like her, or thou not false like</p>

<p>him?</p>

<p>Ay me, I can no more. Die, Margaret,</p>

<p>For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Noise within. Enter Warwick and Salisbury,</p>

<p>and many Commons.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>It is reported, mighty sovereign,</p>

<p>That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murdered</p>

<p>By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort’s means.</p>

<p>The Commons, like an angry hive of bees</p>

<p>That want their leader, scatter up and down</p>

<p>And care not who they sting in his revenge.</p>

<p>Myself have calmed their spleenful mutiny,</p>

<p>Until they hear the order of his death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>That he is dead, good Warwick, ’tis too true;</p>

<p>But how he died God knows, not Henry.</p>

<p>Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,</p>

<p>And comment then upon his sudden death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>That shall I do, my liege.–Stay, Salisbury,</p>

<p>With the rude multitude till I return.</p>

<p><center><i>[Warwick exits through one door; Salisbury and</p>

<p>Commons exit through another.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,</p>

<p>My thoughts that labor to persuade my soul</p>

<p>Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey’s life.</p>

<p>If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,</p>

<p>For judgment only doth belong to Thee.</p>

<p>Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips</p>

<p>With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain</p>

<p>Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,</p>

<p>To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk</p>

<p>And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling;</p>

<p>But all in vain are these mean obsequies.</p>

<p>And to survey his dead and earthy image,</p>

<p>What were it but to make my sorrow greater?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Bed put forth, bearing Gloucester’s body.</p>

<p>Enter Warwick.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Come hither, gracious sovereign. View this body.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <span class='sc'>Henry</span></p>

<p>That is to see how deep my grave is made,</p>

<p>For with his soul fled all my worldly solace;</p>

<p>For seeing him, I see my life in death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>As surely as my soul intends to live</p>

<p>With that dread King that took our state upon Him</p>

<p>To free us from His Father’s wrathful curse,</p>

<p>I do believe that violent hands were laid</p>

<p>Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!</p>

<p>What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>See how the blood is settled in his face.</p>

<p>Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,</p>

<p>Of ashy semblance, meager, pale, and bloodless,</p>

<p>Being all descended to the laboring heart,</p>

<p>Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,</p>

<p>Attracts the same for aidance ’gainst the enemy,</p>

<p>Which with the heart there cools and ne’er</p>

<p>returneth</p>

<p>To blush and beautify the cheek again.</p>

<p>But see, his face is black and full of blood;</p>

<p>His eyeballs further out than when he lived,</p>

<p>Staring full ghastly, like a strangled man;</p>

<p>His hair upreared, his nostrils stretched with</p>

<p>struggling;</p>

<p>His hands abroad displayed, as one that grasped</p>

<p>And tugged for life and was by strength subdued.</p>

<p>Look, on the sheets his hair, you see, is sticking;</p>

<p>His well-proportioned beard made rough and</p>

<p>rugged,</p>

<p>Like to the summer’s corn by tempest lodged.</p>

<p>It cannot be but he was murdered here.</p>

<p>The least of all these signs were probable.</p>

<p><center><i>[The bed is removed.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Why, Warwick, who should do the Duke to death?</p>

<p>Myself and Beaufort had him in protection,</p>

<p>And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>But both of you were vowed Duke Humphrey’s foes,</p>

<p><i>[To Cardinal.]</i> And you, forsooth, had the good duke</p>

<p>to keep.</p>

<p>’Tis like you would not feast him like a friend,</p>

<p>And ’tis well seen he found an enemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen</p>

<p>As guilty of Duke Humphrey’s timeless death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh,</p>

<p>And sees fast by a butcher with an ax,</p>

<p>But will suspect ’twas he that made the slaughter?</p>

<p>Who finds the partridge in the puttock’s nest</p>

<p>But may imagine how the bird was dead,</p>

<p>Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?</p>

<p>Even so suspicious is this tragedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where’s your knife?</p>

<p>Is Beaufort termed a kite? Where are his talons?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men,</p>

<p>But here’s a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,</p>

<p>That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart</p>

<p>That slanders me with murder’s crimson badge.–</p>

<p>Say, if thou dar’st, proud lord of Warwickshire,</p>

<p>That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey’s death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>He dares not calm his contumelious spirit</p>

<p>Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,</p>

<p>Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Madam, be still–with reverence may I say–</p>

<p>For every word you speak in his behalf</p>

<p>Is slander to your royal dignity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!</p>

<p>If ever lady wronged her lord so much,</p>

<p>Thy mother took into her blameful bed</p>

<p>Some stern untutored churl, and noble stock</p>

<p>Was graft with crab-tree slip, whose fruit thou art</p>

<p>And never of the Nevilles’ noble race.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee</p>

<p>And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,</p>

<p>Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,</p>

<p>And that my sovereign’s presence makes me mild,</p>

<p>I would, false murd’rous coward, on thy knee</p>

<p>Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech</p>

<p>And say it was thy mother that thou meant’st,</p>

<p>That thou thyself wast born in bastardy;</p>

<p>And after all this fearful homage done,</p>

<p>Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,</p>

<p>Pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood,</p>

<p>If from this presence thou dar’st go with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Warwick</span></p>

<p>Away even now, or I will drag thee hence!</p>

<p>Unworthy though thou art, I’ll cope with thee</p>

<p>Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death</p>

<p>Or banished fair England’s territories,</p>

<p>They will by violence tear him from your palace</p>

<p>And torture him with grievous ling’ring death.</p>

<p>They say, by him the good duke Humphrey died;</p>

<p>They say, in him they fear your Highness’ death;</p>

<p>And mere instinct of love and loyalty,</p>

<p>Free from a stubborn opposite intent,</p>

<p>As being thought to contradict your liking,</p>

<p>Makes them thus forward in his banishment.</p>

<p>They say, in care of your most royal person,</p>

<p>That if your Highness should intend to sleep,</p>

<p>And charge that no man should disturb your rest,</p>

<p>In pain of your dislike or pain of death,</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,</p>

<p>Their sweetest shade, a grove of cypress trees;</p>

<p>Their chiefest prospect, murd’ring basilisks;</p>

<p>Their softest touch, as smart as lizards’ stings!</p>

<p>Their music, frightful as the serpent’s hiss,</p>

<p>And boding screech owls make the consort full!</p>

<p>All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment’st thyself,</p>

<p>And these dread curses, like the sun ’gainst glass,</p>

<p>Or like an over-charged gun, recoil</p>

<p>And turn the force of them upon thyself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?</p>

<p>Now, by the ground that I am banished from,</p>

<p>Well could I curse away a winter’s night,</p>

<p>Though standing naked on a mountain top</p>

<p>Where biting cold would never let grass grow,</p>

<p>And think it but a minute spent in sport.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>O, let me entreat thee cease! Give me thy hand,</p>

<p>That I may dew it with my mournful tears;</p>

<p>Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place</p>

<p>To wash away my woeful monuments.</p>

<p><center><i>[She kisses his hand.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,</p>

<p>That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,</p>

<p>Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for</p>

<p>thee!</p>

<p>So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;</p>

<p>’Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,</p>

<p>As one that surfeits thinking on a want.</p>

<p>I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,</p>

<p>Adventure to be banished myself;</p>

<p>And banished I am, if but from thee.</p>

<p>Go, speak not to me. Even now be gone!</p>

<p>O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemned</p>

<p>Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,</p>

<p>Loather a hundred times to part than die.</p>

<p><center><i>[They embrace.]</i></center></p>

<p>Yet now farewell, and farewell life with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished,</p>

<p>Once by the King, and three times thrice by thee.</p>

<p>’Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence.</p>

<p>A wilderness is populous enough,</p>

<p>So Suffolk had thy heavenly company;</p>

<p>For where thou art, there is the world itself,</p>

<p>With every several pleasure in the world;</p>

<p>And where thou art not, desolation.</p>

<p>I can no more. Live thou to joy thy life;</p>

<p>Myself no joy in naught but that thou liv’st.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Vaux.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Whither goes Vaux so fast? What news, I prithee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Vaux</span>  To signify unto his Majesty,</p>

<p>That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;</p>

<p>For suddenly a grievous sickness took him</p>

<p>That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,</p>

<p>Blaspheming God and cursing men on Earth.</p>

<p>Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey’s ghost</p>

<p>Were by his side; sometimes he calls the King</p>

<p>And whispers to his pillow, as to him,</p>

<p>The secrets of his overcharged soul.</p>

<p>And I am sent to tell his Majesty</p>

<p>That even now he cries aloud for him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Go, tell this heavy message to the King.     <i><i>[Vaux exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Ay me! What is this world? What news are these!</p>

<p>But wherefore grieve I at an hour’s poor loss,</p>

<p>Omitting Suffolk’s exile, my soul’s treasure?</p>

<p>Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,</p>

<p>And with the southern clouds contend in tears–</p>

<p>Theirs for the earth’s increase, mine for my</p>

<p>sorrows’?</p>

<p>Now get thee hence. The King, thou know’st, is</p>

<p>coming;</p>

<p>If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>If I depart from thee, I cannot live;</p>

<p>And in thy sight to die, what were it else</p>

<p>But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?</p>

<p>Here could I breathe my soul into the air,</p>

<p>As mild and gentle as the cradle babe</p>

<p>Dying with mother’s dug between its lips;</p>

<p>Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad</p>

<p>And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,</p>

<p>To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth.</p>

<p>So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,</p>

<p>Or I should breathe it so into thy body,</p>

<p>And then it lived in sweet Elysium.</p>

<p>To die by thee were but to die in jest;</p>

<p>From thee to die were torture more than death.</p>

<p>O, let me stay, befall what may befall!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>Away! Though parting be a fretful corrosive,</p>

<p>It is applied to a deathful wound.</p>

<p>To France, sweet Suffolk. Let me hear from thee,</p>

<p>For wheresoe’er thou art in this world’s globe,</p>

<p>I’ll have an Iris that shall find thee out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>  I go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  And take my heart with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Suffolk</span></p>

<p>A jewel locked into the woefull’st cask</p>

<p>That ever did contain a thing of worth!</p>

<p>Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we.</p>

<p>This way fall I to death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span> <span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  This way for me.</p>
