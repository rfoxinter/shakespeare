<p><center><i>[Alarum. Offstage fight at sea. Ordnance goes off.</p>

<p>Enter Lieutenant, Suffolk, captive and in disguise,</p>

<p>and Others, including a Master, a Master’s Mate,</p>

<p>Walter Whitmore, and Prisoners.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lieutenant</sc></p>

<p>The gaudy, blabbing, and remorseful day</p>

<p>Is crept into the bosom of the sea,</p>

<p>And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades</p>

<p>That drag the tragic melancholy night,</p>

<p>Who, with their drowsy, slow, and flagging wings</p>

<p>Clip dead men’s graves, and from their misty jaws</p>

<p>Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.</p>

<p>Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;</p>

<p>For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,</p>

<p>Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,</p>

<p>Or with their blood stain this discolored shore.–</p>

<p>Master, this prisoner freely give I thee.–</p>

<p>And, thou that art his mate, make boot of this.–</p>

<p>The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.</p>

<p><center><i>[Three gentlemen prisoners, including Suffolk,</p>

<p>are handed over.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>What is my ransom, master? Let me know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Master</sc></p>

<p>A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Mate</sc> <i>[to the Second Gentleman]</i></p>

<p>And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lieutenant</sc></p>

<p>What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,</p>

<p>And bear the name and port of gentlemen?–</p>

<p>Cut both the villains’ throats–for die you shall;</p>

<p>The lives of those which we have lost in fight</p>

<p>Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>I’ll give it, sir, and therefore spare my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>And so will I, and write home for it straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Whitmore</sc> <i>[to Suffolk]</i></p>

<p>I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,</p>

<p>And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die;</p>

<p>And so should these, if I might have my will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lieutenant</sc></p>

<p>Be not so rash. Take ransom; let him live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Look on my George; I am a gentleman.</p>

<p>Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Whitmore</sc></p>

<p>And so am I. My name is Walter Whitmore.</p>

<p><center><i>[Suffolk starts.]</i></center></p>

<p>How now, why starts thou? What, doth death</p>

<p>affright?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.</p>

<p>A cunning man did calculate my birth</p>

<p>And told me that by water I should die.</p>

<p>Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;</p>

<p>Thy name is Gualtier, being rightly sounded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Whitmore</sc></p>

<p>Gualtier or Walter, which it is, I care not.</p>

<p>Never yet did base dishonor blur our name</p>

<p>But with our sword we wiped away the blot.</p>

<p>Therefore, when merchantlike I sell revenge,</p>

<p>Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,</p>

<p>And I proclaimed a coward through the world!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince,</p>

<p>The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Whitmore</sc></p>

<p>The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Ay, but these rags are no part of the Duke.</p>

<p>Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lieutenant</sc></p>

<p>But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Obscure and lousy swain, King Henry’s blood,</p>

<p>The honorable blood of Lancaster,</p>

<p>Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.</p>

<p>Hast thou not kissed thy hand and held my stirrup?</p>

<p>Bareheaded plodded by my footcloth mule,</p>

<p>And thought thee happy when I shook my head?</p>

<p>How often hast thou waited at my cup,</p>

<p>Fed from my trencher, kneeled down at the board,</p>

<p>When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?</p>

<p>Remember it, and let it make thee crestfall’n,</p>

<p>Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride.</p>

<p>How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood</p>

<p>And duly waited for my coming forth?</p>

<p>This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,</p>

<p>And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Whitmore</sc></p>

<p>Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lieutenant</sc></p>

<p>First let my words stab him as he hath me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Base slave, thy words are blunt, and so art thou.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lieutenant</sc></p>

<p>Convey him hence, and on our longboat’s side,</p>

<p>Strike off his head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  Thou dar’st not for thy own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lieutenant</sc></p>

<p>Yes, Pole.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc>  Pole!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lieutenant</sc>  Pole! Sir Pole! Lord!</p>

<p>Ay, kennel, puddle, sink, whose filth and dirt</p>

<p>Troubles the silver spring where England drinks!</p>

<p>Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth</p>

<p>For swallowing the treasure of the realm.</p>

<p>Thy lips that kissed the Queen shall sweep the</p>

<p>ground,</p>

<p>And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey’s</p>

<p>death</p>

<p>Against the senseless winds shall grin in vain,</p>

<p>Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again.</p>

<p>And wedded be thou to the hags of hell</p>

<p>For daring to affy a mighty lord</p>

<p>Unto the daughter of a worthless king,</p>

<p>Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.</p>

<p>By devilish policy art thou grown great,</p>

<p>And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged</p>

<p>With gobbets of thy mother’s bleeding heart.</p>

<p>By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France.</p>

<p>The false revolting Normans thorough thee</p>

<p>Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy</p>

<p>Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,</p>

<p>And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.</p>

<p>The princely Warwick, and the Nevilles all,</p>

<p>Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,</p>

<p>As hating thee, are rising up in arms.</p>

<p>And now the house of York, thrust from the crown</p>

<p>By shameful murder of a guiltless king</p>

<p>And lofty, proud, encroaching tyranny,</p>

<p>Burns with revenging fire, whose hopeful colors</p>

<p>Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,</p>

<p>Under the which is writ “Invitis nubibus.”</p>

<p>The commons here in Kent are up in arms,</p>

<p>And, to conclude, reproach and beggary</p>

<p>Is crept into the palace of our king,</p>

<p>And all by thee.–Away! Convey him hence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>O, that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder</p>

<p>Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!</p>

<p>Small things make base men proud. This villain</p>

<p>here,</p>

<p>Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more</p>

<p>Than Bargulus, the strong Illyrian pirate.</p>

<p>Drones suck not eagles’ blood, but rob beehives.</p>

<p>It is impossible that I should die</p>

<p>By such a lowly vassal as thyself.</p>

<p>Thy words move rage and not remorse in me.</p>

<p>I go of message from the Queen to France.</p>

<p>I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lieutenant</sc>  Walter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Whitmore</sc></p>

<p>Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Paene gelidus timor occupat artus.</p>

<p>It is thee I fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Whitmore</sc></p>

<p>Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.</p>

<p>What, are you daunted now? Now will you stoop?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>My gracious lord, entreat him; speak him fair.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Suffolk’s imperial tongue is stern and rough,</p>

<p>Used to command, untaught to plead for favor.</p>

<p>Far be it we should honor such as these</p>

<p>With humble suit. No, rather let my head</p>

<p>Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any</p>

<p>Save to the God of heaven and to my king;</p>

<p>And sooner dance upon a bloody pole</p>

<p>Than stand uncovered to the vulgar groom.</p>

<p>True nobility is exempt from fear.–</p>

<p>More can I bear than you dare execute.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lieutenant</sc></p>

<p>Hale him away, and let him talk no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Suffolk</sc></p>

<p>Come, soldiers, show what cruelty you can,</p>

<p>That this my death may never be forgot!</p>

<p>Great men oft die by vile bezonians:</p>

<p>A Roman sworder and banditto slave</p>

<p>Murdered sweet Tully; Brutus’ bastard hand</p>

<p>Stabbed Julius Caesar; savage islanders</p>

<p>Pompey the Great, and Suffolk dies by pirates.</p>

<p><center><i>[Walter Whitmore exits with</p>

<p>Suffolk and Others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lieutenant</sc></p>

<p>And as for these whose ransom we have set,</p>

<p>It is our pleasure one of them depart.</p>

<p><i>[To Second Gentleman.]</i> Therefore come you with us,</p>

<p>and let him go.     <i><i>[Lieutenant and the rest exit.</i></p>

<p>The First Gentleman remains.]</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Walter Whitmore with the body</p>

<p>and severed head of Suffolk.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Whitmore</sc></p>

<p>There let his head and lifeless body lie,</p>

<p>Until the Queen his mistress bury it.</p>

<p><center><i>[Walter Whitmore exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>O, barbarous and bloody spectacle!</p>

<p>His body will I bear unto the King.</p>

<p>If he revenge it not, yet will his friends.</p>

<p>So will the Queen, that living held him dear.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits with the head and body.]</i></center></p>
