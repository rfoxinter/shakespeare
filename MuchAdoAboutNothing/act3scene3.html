<p><center><i>[Enter Dogberry and his compartner Verges</p>

<p>with the Watch.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Are you good men and true?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer</p>

<p>salvation, body and soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Nay, that were a punishment too good for</p>

<p>them if they should have any allegiance in them,</p>

<p>being chosen for the Prince’s watch.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  Well, give them their charge, neighbor</p>

<p>Dogberry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  First, who think you the most desartless</p>

<p>man to be constable?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Watchman</sc>  Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacoal,</p>

<p>for they can write and read.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Come hither, neighbor Seacoal. <i>[Seacoal</p>

<p>steps forward.]</i> God hath blessed you with a good</p>

<p>name. To be a well-favored man is the gift of</p>

<p>fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seacoal</sc>  Both which, master constable–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  You have. I knew it would be your answer.</p>

<p>Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and</p>

<p>make no boast of it, and for your writing and</p>

<p>reading, let that appear when there is no need of</p>

<p>such vanity. You are thought here to be the most</p>

<p>senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch;</p>

<p>therefore bear you the lantern. This is your charge:</p>

<p>you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to</p>

<p>bid any man stand, in the Prince’s name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seacoal</sc>  How if he will not stand?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Why, then, take no note of him, but let him</p>

<p>go, and presently call the rest of the watch together</p>

<p>and thank God you are rid of a knave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is</p>

<p>none of the Prince’s subjects.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  True, and they are to meddle with none but</p>

<p>the Prince’s subjects.–You shall also make no</p>

<p>noise in the streets; for, for the watch to babble and</p>

<p>to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Watchman</sc>  We will rather sleep than talk.</p>

<p>We know what belongs to a watch.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Why, you speak like an ancient and most</p>

<p>quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping</p>

<p>should offend; only have a care that your bills be not</p>

<p>stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses and</p>

<p>bid those that are drunk get them to bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seacoal</sc>  How if they will not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Why then, let them alone till they are sober.</p>

<p>If they make you not then the better answer, you</p>

<p>may say they are not the men you took them for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seacoal</sc>  Well, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by</p>

<p>virtue of your office, to be no true man, and for such</p>

<p>kind of men, the less you meddle or make with</p>

<p>them, why, the more is for your honesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seacoal</sc>  If we know him to be a thief, shall we not</p>

<p>lay hands on him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Truly, by your office you may, but I think</p>

<p>they that touch pitch will be defiled. The most</p>

<p>peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to</p>

<p>let him show himself what he is and steal out of</p>

<p>your company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  You have been always called a merciful man,</p>

<p>partner.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will,</p>

<p>much more a man who hath any honesty in him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc> <i>[to the Watch]</i>  If you hear a child cry in the</p>

<p>night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Watchman</sc>  How if the nurse be asleep and</p>

<p>will not hear us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Why, then depart in peace, and let the</p>

<p>child wake her with crying, for the ewe that will</p>

<p>not hear her lamb when it baas will never answer a</p>

<p>calf when he bleats.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  ’Tis very true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  This is the end of the charge. You, constable,</p>

<p>are to present the Prince’s own person. If you</p>

<p>meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  Nay, by ’r Lady, that I think he cannot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Five shillings to one on ’t, with any man that</p>

<p>knows the statutes, he may stay him–marry, not</p>

<p>without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch</p>

<p>ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a</p>

<p>man against his will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  By ’r Lady, I think it be so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Ha, ah ha!–Well, masters, goodnight. An</p>

<p>there be any matter of weight chances, call up me.</p>

<p>Keep your fellows’ counsels and your own, and</p>

<p>goodnight.–Come, neighbor.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dogberry and Verges begin to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seacoal</sc>  Well, masters, we hear our charge. Let us go</p>

<p>sit here upon the church bench till two, and then all</p>

<p>to bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  One word more, honest neighbors. I pray</p>

<p>you watch about Signior Leonato’s door, for the</p>

<p>wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil</p>

<p>tonight. Adieu, be vigitant, I beseech you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dogberry and Verges exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Borachio and Conrade.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  What, Conrade!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seacoal</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Peace, stir not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Conrade, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  Here, man, I am at thy elbow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Mass, and my elbow itched, I thought there</p>

<p>would a scab follow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  I will owe thee an answer for that. And now</p>

<p>forward with thy tale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Stand thee close, then, under this penthouse,</p>

<p>for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true</p>

<p>drunkard, utter all to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seacoal</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Some treason, masters. Yet stand</p>

<p>close.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Therefore know, I have earned of Don</p>

<p>John a thousand ducats.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  Is it possible that any villainy should be so</p>

<p>dear?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible</p>

<p>any villainy should be so rich. For when rich</p>

<p>villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may</p>

<p>make what price they will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  I wonder at it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou</p>

<p>knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a</p>

<p>cloak, is nothing to a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  Yes, it is apparel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  I mean the fashion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  Yes, the fashion is the fashion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Tush, I may as well say the fool’s the fool.</p>

<p>But seest thou not what a deformed thief this</p>

<p>fashion is?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Watchman</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  I know that Deformed. He</p>

<p>has been a vile thief this seven year. He goes up and</p>

<p>down like a gentleman. I remember his name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Didst thou not hear somebody?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  No, ’twas the vane on the house.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief</p>

<p>this fashion is, how giddily he turns about all the</p>

<p>hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty,</p>

<p>sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh’s soldiers</p>

<p>in the reechy painting, sometimes like god Bel’s</p>

<p>priests in the old church window, sometimes like</p>

<p>the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten</p>

<p>tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his</p>

<p>club?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears</p>

<p>out more apparel than the man. But art not thou</p>

<p>thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast</p>

<p>shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the</p>

<p>fashion?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Not so, neither. But know that I have tonight</p>

<p>wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman,</p>

<p>by the name of Hero. She leans me out at</p>

<p>her mistress’ chamber window, bids me a thousand</p>

<p>times goodnight. I tell this tale vilely. I should first</p>

<p>tell thee how the Prince, Claudio, and my master,</p>

<p>planted and placed and possessed by my master</p>

<p>Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable</p>

<p>amiable encounter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  And thought they Margaret was Hero?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio,</p>

<p>but the devil my master knew she was Margaret;</p>

<p>and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them,</p>

<p>partly by the dark night, which did deceive them,</p>

<p>but chiefly by my villainy, which did confirm any</p>

<p>slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio</p>

<p>enraged, swore he would meet her as he was</p>

<p>appointed next morning at the temple, and there,</p>

<p>before the whole congregation, shame her with</p>

<p>what he saw o’ernight and send her home again</p>

<p>without a husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Watchman</sc>  We charge you in the Prince’s name</p>

<p>stand!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Seacoal</sc>  Call up the right Master Constable. <i>[Second</p>

<p>Watchman exits.]</i> We have here recovered the most</p>

<p>dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in</p>

<p>the commonwealth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Watchman</sc>  And one Deformed is one of them. I</p>

<p>know him; he wears a lock.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Dogberry, Verges, and Second Watchman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Masters, masters–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Watchman</sc> <i>[to Borachio]</i>  You’ll be made bring</p>

<p>Deformed forth, I warrant you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc> <i>[to Borachio and Conrade]</i>  Masters, never</p>

<p>speak, we charge you, let us obey you to go with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc> <i>[to Conrade]</i>  We are like to prove a goodly</p>

<p>commodity, being taken up of these men’s bills.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  A commodity in question, I warrant you.–</p>

<p>Come, we’ll obey you.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
