<p><center><i>[Enter the Constables Dogberry and Verges, and the</p>

<p>Town Clerk, or Sexton, in gowns, with the Watch,</p>

<p>Conrade, and Borachio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Is our whole dissembly appeared?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Verges</span>  O, a stool and a cushion for the Sexton.</p>

<p><center><i>[A stool is brought in; the Sexton sits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sexton</span>  Which be the malefactors?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Marry, that am I, and my partner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Verges</span>  Nay, that’s certain, we have the exhibition to</p>

<p>examine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sexton</span>  But which are the offenders that are to be</p>

<p>examined? Let them come before Master</p>

<p>Constable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Yea, marry, let them come before me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Conrade and Borachio are brought forward.]</i></center></p>

<p>What is your name, friend?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  Borachio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Pray, write down “Borachio.”–Yours,</p>

<p>sirrah?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Conrade</span>  I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is</p>

<p>Conrade.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Write down “Master Gentleman Conrade.”–</p>

<p>Masters, do you serve God?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>/<span class='sc'>Conrade</span>  Yea, sir, we hope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Write down that they hope they serve</p>

<p>God; and write God first, for God defend but God</p>

<p>should go before such villains!–Masters, it is</p>

<p>proved already that you are little better than false</p>

<p>knaves, and it will go near to be thought so shortly.</p>

<p>How answer you for yourselves?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Conrade</span>  Marry, sir, we say we are none.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  A marvelous witty fellow, I assure you,</p>

<p>but I will go about with him.–Come you hither,</p>

<p>sirrah, a word in your ear. Sir, I say to you it is</p>

<p>thought you are false knaves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  Sir, I say to you we are none.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Well, stand aside.–’Fore God, they are</p>

<p>both in a tale. Have you writ down that they are</p>

<p>none?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sexton</span>  Master constable, you go not the way to</p>

<p>examine. You must call forth the watch that are</p>

<p>their accusers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Yea, marry, that’s the eftest way.–Let</p>

<p>the watch come forth. Masters, I charge you in the</p>

<p>Prince’s name, accuse these men.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watchman</span>  This man said, sir, that Don John, the</p>

<p>Prince’s brother, was a villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Write down Prince John a villain. Why,</p>

<p>this is flat perjury, to call a prince’s brother villain!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  Master constable–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Pray thee, fellow, peace. I do not like thy</p>

<p>look, I promise thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sexton</span> <i>[to Watch]</i>  What heard you him say else?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Seacoal</span>  Marry, that he had received a thousand</p>

<p>ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero</p>

<p>wrongfully.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Flat burglary as ever was committed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Verges</span>  Yea, by Mass, that it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sexton</span>  What else, fellow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>First</span> <span class='sc'>Watchman</span>  And that Count Claudio did mean,</p>

<p>upon his words, to disgrace Hero before the whole</p>

<p>assembly, and not marry her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span> <i>[to Borachio]</i>  O, villain! Thou wilt be condemned</p>

<p>into everlasting redemption for this!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sexton</span>  What else?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Seacoal</span>  This is all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sexton</span>  And this is more, masters, than you can deny.</p>

<p>Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away.</p>

<p>Hero was in this manner accused, in this very</p>

<p>manner refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly</p>

<p>died.–Master constable, let these men be bound</p>

<p>and brought to Leonato’s. I will go before and show</p>

<p>him their examination.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Come, let them be opinioned.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Verges</span>  Let them be in the hands–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Conrade</span>  Off, coxcomb!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  God’s my life, where’s the Sexton? Let</p>

<p>him write down the Prince’s officer “coxcomb.”</p>

<p>Come, bind them.–Thou naughty varlet!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Conrade</span>  Away! You are an ass, you are an ass!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Dogberry</span>  Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost</p>

<p>thou not suspect my years? O, that he were here to</p>

<p>write me down an ass! But masters, remember that</p>

<p>I am an ass, though it be not written down, yet</p>

<p>forget not that I am an ass.–No, thou villain, thou</p>

<p>art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by</p>

<p>good witness. I am a wise fellow and, which is more,</p>

<p>an officer and, which is more, a householder and,</p>

<p>which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in</p>

<p>Messina, and one that knows the law, go to, and a</p>

<p>rich fellow enough, go to, and a fellow that hath had</p>

<p>losses, and one that hath two gowns and everything</p>

<p>handsome about him.–Bring him away.–O, that I</p>

<p>had been writ down an ass!</p>
