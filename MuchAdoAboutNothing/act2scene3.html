<p><center><i>[Enter Benedick alone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Boy!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Boy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  Signior?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  In my chamber window lies a book. Bring it</p>

<p>hither to me in the orchard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Boy</span>  I am here already, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  I know that, but I would have thee hence</p>

<p>and here again.     <i><i>[Boy exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much</p>

<p>another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors</p>

<p>to love, will, after he hath laughed at such</p>

<p>shallow follies in others, become the argument of</p>

<p>his own scorn by falling in love–and such a man is</p>

<p>Claudio. I have known when there was no music</p>

<p>with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he</p>

<p>rather hear the tabor and the pipe; I have known</p>

<p>when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a</p>

<p>good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake</p>

<p>carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont</p>

<p>to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest</p>

<p>man and a soldier, and now is he turned orthography;</p>

<p>his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so</p>

<p>many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see</p>

<p>with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not</p>

<p>be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster,</p>

<p>but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an</p>

<p>oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool.</p>

<p>One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet</p>

<p>I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all</p>

<p>graces be in one woman, one woman shall not</p>

<p>come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s certain;</p>

<p>wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen</p>

<p>her; fair, or I’ll never look on her; mild, or come not</p>

<p>near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good</p>

<p>discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall</p>

<p>be of what color it please God. Ha! The Prince and</p>

<p>Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbor.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hides.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Prince, Leonato, Claudio, and Balthasar</p>

<p>with music.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Come, shall we hear this music?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,</p>

<p>As hushed on purpose to grace harmony!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <i>[aside to Claudio]</i></p>

<p>See you where Benedick hath hid himself?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span> <i>[aside to Prince]</i></p>

<p>O, very well my lord. The music ended,</p>

<p>We’ll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>Come, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span></p>

<p>O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice</p>

<p>To slander music any more than once.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>It is the witness still of excellency</p>

<p>To put a strange face on his own perfection.</p>

<p>I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span></p>

<p>Because you talk of wooing, I will sing,</p>

<p>Since many a wooer doth commence his suit</p>

<p>To her he thinks not worthy, yet he woos,</p>

<p>Yet will he swear he loves.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Nay, pray thee, come,</p>

<p>Or if thou wilt hold longer argument,</p>

<p>Do it in notes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span>  Note this before my notes:</p>

<p>There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks!</p>

<p>Note notes, forsooth, and nothing.     <i><i>[Music plays.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Now, divine air! Now is his soul</p>

<p>ravished. Is it not strange that sheeps’ guts should</p>

<p>hale souls out of men’s bodies? Well, a horn for my</p>

<p>money, when all’s done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Men were deceivers ever,</i></p>

<p>     <i>One foot in sea and one on shore,</i></p>

<p>        <i>To one thing constant never.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Then sigh not so, but let them go,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And be you blithe and bonny,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Converting all your sounds of woe</i></p>

<p>        <i>Into Hey, nonny nonny.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>Sing no more ditties, sing no mo,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Of dumps so dull and heavy.</i></p>

<p>     <i>The fraud of men was ever so,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Since summer first was leavy.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Then sigh not so, but let them go,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And be you blithe and bonny,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Converting all your sounds of woe</i></p>

<p>        <i>Into Hey, nonny nonny.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  By my troth, a good song.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span>  And an ill singer, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Ha, no, no, faith, thou sing’st well enough for a</p>

<p>shift.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span> <i>[aside]</i>  An he had been a dog that should</p>

<p>have howled thus, they would have hanged him. And</p>

<p>I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief. I had as</p>

<p>lief have heard the night raven, come what plague</p>

<p>could have come after it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray</p>

<p>thee get us some excellent music, for tomorrow</p>

<p>night we would have it at the Lady Hero’s chamber</p>

<p>window.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span>  The best I can, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Do so. Farewell.     <i><i>[Balthasar exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of</p>

<p>today, that your niece Beatrice was in love with</p>

<p>Signior Benedick?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  O, ay. <i>[Aside to Prince.]</i> Stalk on, stalk on; the</p>

<p>fowl sits.–I did never think that lady would have</p>

<p>loved any man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  No, nor I neither, but most wonderful that</p>

<p>she should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she</p>

<p>hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to</p>

<p>abhor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Is ’t possible? Sits the wind in that</p>

<p>corner?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to</p>

<p>think of it, but that she loves him with an enraged</p>

<p>affection, it is past the infinite of thought.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Maybe she doth but counterfeit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Faith, like enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  O God! Counterfeit? There was never counterfeit</p>

<p>of passion came so near the life of passion as</p>

<p>she discovers it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Why, what effects of passion shows she?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span> <i>[aside to Leonato]</i>  Bait the hook well; this fish</p>

<p>will bite.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  What effects, my lord? She will sit you–you</p>

<p>heard my daughter tell you how.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  She did indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  How, how I pray you? You amaze me. I would</p>

<p>have thought her spirit had been invincible against</p>

<p>all assaults of affection.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  I would have sworn it had, my lord, especially</p>

<p>against Benedick.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span> <i>[aside]</i>  I should think this a gull but that the</p>

<p>white-bearded fellow speaks it. Knavery cannot,</p>

<p>sure, hide himself in such reverence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span> <i>[aside to Prince]</i>  He hath ta’en th’ infection.</p>

<p>Hold it up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Hath she made her affection known to</p>

<p>Benedick?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  No, and swears she never will. That’s her</p>

<p>torment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  ’Tis true indeed, so your daughter says. “Shall</p>

<p>I,” says she, “that have so oft encountered him with</p>

<p>scorn, write to him that I love him?”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  This says she now when she is beginning to</p>

<p>write to him, for she’ll be up twenty times a night,</p>

<p>and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ</p>

<p>a sheet of paper. My daughter tells us all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember</p>

<p>a pretty jest your daughter told us of.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  O, when she had writ it and was reading it</p>

<p>over, she found “Benedick” and “Beatrice” between</p>

<p>the sheet?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  That.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence,</p>

<p>railed at herself that she should be so</p>

<p>immodest to write to one that she knew would flout</p>

<p>her. “I measure him,” says she, “by my own spirit,</p>

<p>for I should flout him if he writ to me, yea, though I</p>

<p>love him, I should.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps,</p>

<p>sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses:</p>

<p>“O sweet Benedick, God give me patience!”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  She doth indeed, my daughter says so, and</p>

<p>the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my</p>

<p>daughter is sometimes afeared she will do a desperate</p>

<p>outrage to herself. It is very true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  It were good that Benedick knew of it by some</p>

<p>other, if she will not discover it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  To what end? He would make but a sport of it</p>

<p>and torment the poor lady worse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  An he should, it were an alms to hang him.</p>

<p>She’s an excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion,</p>

<p>she is virtuous.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  And she is exceeding wise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  In everything but in loving Benedick.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in</p>

<p>so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that</p>

<p>blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have</p>

<p>just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  I would she had bestowed this dotage on me. I</p>

<p>would have daffed all other respects and made her</p>

<p>half myself. I pray you tell Benedick of it, and hear</p>

<p>what he will say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Were it good, think you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says</p>

<p>she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere</p>

<p>she make her love known, and she will die if he woo</p>

<p>her rather than she will bate one breath of her</p>

<p>accustomed crossness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  She doth well. If she should make tender of</p>

<p>her love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it, for the man,</p>

<p>as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  He is a very proper man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  He hath indeed a good outward happiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Before God, and in my mind, very wise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  He doth indeed show some sparks that are like</p>

<p>wit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  And I take him to be valiant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing</p>

<p>of quarrels you may say he is wise, for either he</p>

<p>avoids them with great discretion or undertakes</p>

<p>them with a most Christianlike fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  If he do fear God, he must necessarily keep</p>

<p>peace. If he break the peace, he ought to enter into</p>

<p>a quarrel with fear and trembling.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  And so will he do, for the man doth fear God,</p>

<p>howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests</p>

<p>he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall</p>

<p>we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Never tell him, my lord, let her wear it out</p>

<p>with good counsel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Nay, that’s impossible; she may wear her</p>

<p>heart out first.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter.</p>

<p>Let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I</p>

<p>could wish he would modestly examine himself to</p>

<p>see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  My lord, will you walk? Dinner is ready.</p>

<p><center><i>[Leonato, Prince, and Claudio begin to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span> <i>[aside to Prince and Leonato]</i>  If he do not</p>

<p>dote on her upon this, I will never trust my</p>

<p>expectation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <i>[aside to Leonato]</i>  Let there be the same net</p>

<p>spread for her, and that must your daughter and her</p>

<p>gentlewomen carry. The sport will be when they</p>

<p>hold one an opinion of another’s dotage, and no</p>

<p>such matter. That’s the scene that I would see,</p>

<p>which will be merely a dumb show. Let us send her</p>

<p>to call him in to dinner.</p>

<p><center><i>[Prince, Leonato, and Claudio exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span> <i>[coming forward]</i>  This can be no trick. The</p>

<p>conference was sadly borne; they have the truth of</p>

<p>this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady. It seems</p>

<p>her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it</p>

<p>must be requited! I hear how I am censured. They</p>

<p>say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love</p>

<p>come from her. They say, too, that she will rather</p>

<p>die than give any sign of affection. I did never think</p>

<p>to marry. I must not seem proud. Happy are they</p>

<p>that hear their detractions and can put them to</p>

<p>mending. They say the lady is fair; ’tis a truth, I can</p>

<p>bear them witness. And virtuous; ’tis so, I cannot</p>

<p>reprove it. And wise, but for loving me; by my troth,</p>

<p>it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of</p>

<p>her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her! I</p>

<p>may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of</p>

<p>wit broken on me because I have railed so long</p>

<p>against marriage, but doth not the appetite alter? A</p>

<p>man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot</p>

<p>endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and</p>

<p>these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the</p>

<p>career of his humor? No! The world must be peopled.</p>

<p>When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not</p>

<p>think I should live till I were married. Here comes</p>

<p>Beatrice. By this day, she’s a fair lady. I do spy some</p>

<p>marks of love in her.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Beatrice.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Against my will, I am sent to bid you come</p>

<p>in to dinner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  I took no more pains for those thanks than</p>

<p>you take pains to thank me. If it had been painful, I</p>

<p>would not have come.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  You take pleasure then in the message?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Yea, just so much as you may take upon a</p>

<p>knife’s point and choke a daw withal. You have no</p>

<p>stomach, signior. Fare you well.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Ha! “Against my will I am sent to bid you</p>

<p>come in to dinner.” There’s a double meaning in</p>

<p>that. “I took no more pains for those thanks than</p>

<p>you took pains to thank me.” That’s as much as to</p>

<p>say “Any pains that I take for you is as easy as</p>

<p>thanks.” If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I</p>

<p>do not love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.</p>
