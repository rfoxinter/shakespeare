<p><center><i>[Enter Hero, and Margaret, and Ursula.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice and</p>

<p>desire her to rise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span>  I will, lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  And bid her come hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span>  Well.     <i><i>[Ursula exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Troth, I think your other rebato were</p>

<p>better.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  No, pray thee, good Meg, I’ll wear this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  By my troth, ’s not so good, and I warrant</p>

<p>your cousin will say so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  My cousin’s a fool, and thou art another. I’ll</p>

<p>wear none but this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  I like the new tire within excellently, if the</p>

<p>hair were a thought browner; and your gown’s a</p>

<p>most rare fashion, i’ faith. I saw the Duchess of</p>

<p>Milan’s gown that they praise so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  O, that exceeds, they say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  By my troth, ’s but a nightgown in respect</p>

<p>of yours–cloth o’ gold, and cuts, and laced with</p>

<p>silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,</p>

<p>and skirts round underborne with a bluish tinsel.</p>

<p>But for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion,</p>

<p>yours is worth ten on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  God give me joy to wear it, for my heart is</p>

<p>exceeding heavy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  ’Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a</p>

<p>man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  Fie upon thee! Art not ashamed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Of what, lady? Of speaking honorably? Is</p>

<p>not marriage honorable in a beggar? Is not your</p>

<p>lord honorable without marriage? I think you</p>

<p>would have me say “Saving your reverence, a husband.”</p>

<p>An bad thinking do not wrest true speaking,</p>

<p>I’ll offend nobody. Is there any harm in “the heavier</p>

<p>for a husband”? None, I think, an it be the right</p>

<p>husband and the right wife. Otherwise, ’tis light and</p>

<p>not heavy. Ask my lady Beatrice else. Here she</p>

<p>comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Beatrice.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  Good morrow, coz.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Good morrow, sweet Hero.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  Why, how now? Do you speak in the sick tune?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  I am out of all other tune, methinks.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Clap ’s into “Light o’ love.” That goes</p>

<p>without a burden. Do you sing it, and I’ll dance it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  You light o’ love with your heels! Then, if</p>

<p>your husband have stables enough, you’ll see he</p>

<p>shall lack no barns.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  O, illegitimate construction! I scorn that</p>

<p>with my heels.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  ’Tis almost five o’clock, cousin. ’Tis time</p>

<p>you were ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill.</p>

<p>Heigh-ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  For the letter that begins them all, H.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Well, an you be not turned Turk, there’s no</p>

<p>more sailing by the star.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  What means the fool, trow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Nothing, I; but God send everyone their</p>

<p>heart’s desire.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  These gloves the Count sent me, they are an</p>

<p>excellent perfume.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  I am stuffed, cousin. I cannot smell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  A maid, and stuffed! There’s goodly catching</p>

<p>of cold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  O, God help me, God help me! How long</p>

<p>have you professed apprehension?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Ever since you left it. Doth not my wit</p>

<p>become me rarely?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  It is not seen enough; you should wear it in</p>

<p>your cap. By my troth, I am sick.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Get you some of this distilled carduus benedictus</p>

<p>and lay it to your heart. It is the only thing for</p>

<p>a qualm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  There thou prick’st her with a thistle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Benedictus! Why benedictus? You have some</p>

<p>moral in this benedictus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Moral? No, by my troth, I have no moral</p>

<p>meaning; I meant plain holy thistle. You may think</p>

<p>perchance that I think you are in love. Nay, by ’r</p>

<p>Lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list, nor I</p>

<p>list not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot</p>

<p>think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that</p>

<p>you are in love or that you will be in love or that you</p>

<p>can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and</p>

<p>now is he become a man. He swore he would never</p>

<p>marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats</p>

<p>his meat without grudging. And how you may be</p>

<p>converted I know not, but methinks you look with</p>

<p>your eyes as other women do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Not a false gallop.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ursula.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span>  Madam, withdraw. The Prince, the Count,</p>

<p>Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of</p>

<p>the town are come to fetch you to church.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good</p>

<p>Ursula.</p>
