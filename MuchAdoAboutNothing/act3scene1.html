<p><center><i>[Enter Hero and two gentlewomen, Margaret and Ursula.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span></p>

<p>Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor.</p>

<p>There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice</p>

<p>Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.</p>

<p>Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula</p>

<p>Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse</p>

<p>Is all of her. Say that thou overheardst us,</p>

<p>And bid her steal into the pleached bower</p>

<p>Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun</p>

<p>Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites,</p>

<p>Made proud by princes, that advance their pride</p>

<p>Against that power that bred it. There will she hide</p>

<p>her</p>

<p>To listen our propose. This is thy office.</p>

<p>Bear thee well in it, and leave us alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span></p>

<p>I’ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span></p>

<p>Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,</p>

<p>As we do trace this alley up and down,</p>

<p>Our talk must only be of Benedick.</p>

<p>When I do name him, let it be thy part</p>

<p>To praise him more than ever man did merit.</p>

<p>My talk to thee must be how Benedick</p>

<p>Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter</p>

<p>Is little Cupid’s crafty arrow made,</p>

<p>That only wounds by hearsay. Now begin,</p>

<p>For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs</p>

<p>Close by the ground, to hear our conference.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Beatrice, who hides in the bower.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span> <i>[aside to Hero]</i></p>

<p>The pleasant’st angling is to see the fish</p>

<p>Cut with her golden oars the silver stream</p>

<p>And greedily devour the treacherous bait.</p>

<p>So angle we for Beatrice, who even now</p>

<p>Is couched in the woodbine coverture.</p>

<p>Fear you not my part of the dialogue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span> <i>[aside to Ursula]</i></p>

<p>Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing</p>

<p>Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.–</p>

<p><center><i>[They walk near the bower.]</i></center></p>

<p>No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful.</p>

<p>I know her spirits are as coy and wild</p>

<p>As haggards of the rock.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span>  But are you sure</p>

<p>That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span></p>

<p>So says the Prince and my new-trothed lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span></p>

<p>And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span></p>

<p>They did entreat me to acquaint her of it,</p>

<p>But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,</p>

<p>To wish him wrestle with affection</p>

<p>And never to let Beatrice know of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span></p>

<p>Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman</p>

<p>Deserve as full as fortunate a bed</p>

<p>As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span></p>

<p>O god of love! I know he doth deserve</p>

<p>As much as may be yielded to a man,</p>

<p>But Nature never framed a woman’s heart</p>

<p>Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.</p>

<p>Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,</p>

<p>Misprizing what they look on, and her wit</p>

<p>Values itself so highly that to her</p>

<p>All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,</p>

<p>Nor take no shape nor project of affection,</p>

<p>She is so self-endeared.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span>  Sure, I think so,</p>

<p>And therefore certainly it were not good</p>

<p>She knew his love, lest she’ll make sport at it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span></p>

<p>Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,</p>

<p>How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,</p>

<p>But she would spell him backward. If fair-faced,</p>

<p>She would swear the gentleman should be her</p>

<p>sister;</p>

<p>If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic,</p>

<p>Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;</p>

<p>If low, an agate very vilely cut;</p>

<p>If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;</p>

<p>If silent, why, a block moved with none.</p>

<p>So turns she every man the wrong side out,</p>

<p>And never gives to truth and virtue that</p>

<p>Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span></p>

<p>Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span></p>

<p>No, not to be so odd and from all fashions</p>

<p>As Beatrice is cannot be commendable.</p>

<p>But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,</p>

<p>She would mock me into air. O, she would laugh</p>

<p>me</p>

<p>Out of myself, press me to death with wit.</p>

<p>Therefore let Benedick, like covered fire,</p>

<p>Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.</p>

<p>It were a better death than die with mocks,</p>

<p>Which is as bad as die with tickling.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span></p>

<p>Yet tell her of it. Hear what she will say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span></p>

<p>No, rather I will go to Benedick</p>

<p>And counsel him to fight against his passion;</p>

<p>And truly I’ll devise some honest slanders</p>

<p>To stain my cousin with. One doth not know</p>

<p>How much an ill word may empoison liking.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span></p>

<p>O, do not do your cousin such a wrong!</p>

<p>She cannot be so much without true judgment,</p>

<p>Having so swift and excellent a wit</p>

<p>As she is prized to have, as to refuse</p>

<p>So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span></p>

<p>He is the only man of Italy,</p>

<p>Always excepted my dear Claudio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span></p>

<p>I pray you be not angry with me, madam,</p>

<p>Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,</p>

<p>For shape, for bearing, argument, and valor,</p>

<p>Goes foremost in report through Italy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span></p>

<p>Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span></p>

<p>His excellence did earn it ere he had it.</p>

<p>When are you married, madam?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span></p>

<p>Why, every day, tomorrow. Come, go in.</p>

<p>I’ll show thee some attires and have thy counsel</p>

<p>Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow.</p>

<p><center><i>[They move away from the bower.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span> <i>[aside to Hero]</i></p>

<p>She’s limed, I warrant you. We have caught her,</p>

<p>madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span> <i>[aside to Ursula]</i></p>

<p>If it prove so, then loving goes by haps;</p>

<p>Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.</p>

<p><center><i>[Hero and Ursula exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span> <i>[coming forward]</i></p>

<p>What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?</p>

<p>   <i>Stand I condemned for pride and scorn so much?</i></p>

<p>Contempt, farewell, and maiden pride, adieu!</p>

<p>   <i>No glory lives behind the back of such.</i></p>

<p>And Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,</p>

<p>   <i>Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand.</i></p>

<p>If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee</p>

<p>   <i>To bind our loves up in a holy band.</i></p>

<p>For others say thou dost deserve, and I</p>

<p>Believe it better than reportingly.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>
