<p><center><i>[Enter Don John and Borachio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  It is so. The Count Claudio shall marry the</p>

<p>daughter of Leonato.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be</p>

<p>med’cinable to me. I am sick in displeasure to him,</p>

<p>and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges</p>

<p>evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this</p>

<p>marriage?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that</p>

<p>no dishonesty shall appear in me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  Show me briefly how.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  I think I told your Lordship a year since,</p>

<p>how much I am in the favor of Margaret, the</p>

<p>waiting gentlewoman to Hero.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  I remember.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  I can, at any unseasonable instant of the</p>

<p>night, appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber</p>

<p>window.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  What life is in that to be the death of this</p>

<p>marriage?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go</p>

<p>you to the Prince your brother; spare not to tell</p>

<p>him that he hath wronged his honor in marrying</p>

<p>the renowned Claudio, whose estimation do you</p>

<p>mightily hold up, to a contaminated stale, such a</p>

<p>one as Hero.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  What proof shall I make of that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex</p>

<p>Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you</p>

<p>for any other issue?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  Only to despite them I will endeavor</p>

<p>anything.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  Go then, find me a meet hour to draw Don</p>

<p>Pedro and the Count Claudio alone. Tell them that</p>

<p>you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal</p>

<p>both to the Prince and Claudio, as in love of your</p>

<p>brother’s honor, who hath made this match, and his</p>

<p>friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened</p>

<p>with the semblance of a maid, that you have discovered</p>

<p>thus. They will scarcely believe this without</p>

<p>trial. Offer them instances, which shall bear no less</p>

<p>likelihood than to see me at her chamber window,</p>

<p>hear me call Margaret “Hero,” hear Margaret term</p>

<p>me “Claudio,” and bring them to see this the very</p>

<p>night before the intended wedding, for in the meantime</p>

<p>I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be</p>

<p>absent, and there shall appear such seeming truth</p>

<p>of Hero’s disloyalty that jealousy shall be called</p>

<p>assurance and all the preparation overthrown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will</p>

<p>put it in practice. Be cunning in the working this,</p>

<p>and thy fee is a thousand ducats.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  Be you constant in the accusation, and my</p>

<p>cunning shall not shame me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  I will presently go learn their day of</p>

<p>marriage.</p>
