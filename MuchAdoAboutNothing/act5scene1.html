<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato’s</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>If you go on thus, you will kill yourself,</p>

<p>And ’tis not wisdom thus to second grief</p>

<p>Against yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  I pray thee, cease thy counsel,</p>

<p>Which falls into mine ears as profitless</p>

<p>As water in a sieve. Give not me counsel,</p>

<p>Nor let no comforter delight mine ear</p>

<p>But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.</p>

<p>Bring me a father that so loved his child,</p>

<p>Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine,</p>

<p>And bid him speak of patience.</p>

<p>Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,</p>

<p>And let it answer every strain for strain,</p>

<p>As thus for thus, and such a grief for such,</p>

<p>In every lineament, branch, shape, and form.</p>

<p>If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,</p>

<p>Bid sorrow wag, cry “hem” when he should</p>

<p>groan,</p>

<p>Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk</p>

<p>With candle-wasters, bring him yet to me,</p>

<p>And I of him will gather patience.</p>

<p>But there is no such man. For, brother, men</p>

<p>Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief</p>

<p>Which they themselves not feel, but tasting it,</p>

<p>Their counsel turns to passion, which before</p>

<p>Would give preceptial med’cine to rage,</p>

<p>Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,</p>

<p>Charm ache with air and agony with words.</p>

<p>No, no, ’tis all men’s office to speak patience</p>

<p>To those that wring under the load of sorrow,</p>

<p>But no man’s virtue nor sufficiency</p>

<p>To be so moral when he shall endure</p>

<p>The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel.</p>

<p>My griefs cry louder than advertisement.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato’s</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>Therein do men from children nothing differ.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood,</p>

<p>For there was never yet philosopher</p>

<p>That could endure the toothache patiently,</p>

<p>However they have writ the style of gods</p>

<p>And made a push at chance and sufferance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato’s</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself.</p>

<p>Make those that do offend you suffer too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>There thou speak’st reason. Nay, I will do so.</p>

<p>My soul doth tell me Hero is belied,</p>

<p>And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince</p>

<p>And all of them that thus dishonor her.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Prince and Claudio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato’s</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Good e’en, good e’en.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Good day to both of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Hear you, my lords–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  We have some haste,</p>

<p>Leonato.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Some haste, my lord! Well, fare you well, my lord.</p>

<p>Are you so hasty now? Well, all is one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato’s</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>If he could right himself with quarrelling,</p>

<p>Some of us would lie low.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Who wrongs him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Marry, thou dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou.</p>

<p>Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword.</p>

<p>I fear thee not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Marry, beshrew my hand</p>

<p>If it should give your age such cause of fear.</p>

<p>In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Tush, tush, man, never fleer and jest at me.</p>

<p>I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,</p>

<p>As under privilege of age to brag</p>

<p>What I have done being young, or what would do</p>

<p>Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,</p>

<p>Thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me</p>

<p>That I am forced to lay my reverence by,</p>

<p>And with gray hairs and bruise of many days</p>

<p>Do challenge thee to trial of a man.</p>

<p>I say thou hast belied mine innocent child.</p>

<p>Thy slander hath gone through and through her</p>

<p>heart,</p>

<p>And she lies buried with her ancestors,</p>

<p>O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,</p>

<p>Save this of hers, framed by thy villainy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>My villainy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Thine, Claudio, thine, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>You say not right, old man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  My lord, my lord,</p>

<p>I’ll prove it on his body if he dare,</p>

<p>Despite his nice fence and his active practice,</p>

<p>His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>Away! I will not have to do with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast killed my child.</p>

<p>If thou kill’st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato’s</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>He shall kill two of us, and men indeed,</p>

<p>But that’s no matter. Let him kill one first.</p>

<p>Win me and wear me! Let him answer me.–</p>

<p>Come, follow me, boy. Come, sir boy, come, follow</p>

<p>me.</p>

<p>Sir boy, I’ll whip you from your foining fence,</p>

<p>Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Brother–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato’s</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece,</p>

<p>And she is dead, slandered to death by villains</p>

<p>That dare as well answer a man indeed</p>

<p>As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.–</p>

<p>Boys, apes, braggarts, jacks, milksops!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Brother Anthony–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato’s</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,</p>

<p>And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple–</p>

<p>Scambling, outfacing, fashionmonging boys,</p>

<p>That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,</p>

<p>Go anticly and show outward hideousness,</p>

<p>And speak off half a dozen dang’rous words</p>

<p>How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst,</p>

<p>And this is all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  But brother Anthony–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato’s</sc> <sc>Brother</sc>  Come, ’tis no matter.</p>

<p>Do not you meddle. Let me deal in this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.</p>

<p>My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death,</p>

<p>But, on my honor, she was charged with nothing</p>

<p>But what was true and very full of proof.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  My lord, my lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I will not hear you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>No? Come, brother, away. I will be heard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato’s</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>And shall, or some of us will smart for it.</p>

<p><center><i>[Leonato and his brother exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Benedick.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>See, see, here comes the man we went to seek.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Now, signior, what news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc> <i>[to Prince]</i>  Good day, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Welcome, signior. You are almost come to</p>

<p>part almost a fray.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  We had like to have had our two noses</p>

<p>snapped off with two old men without teeth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Leonato and his brother. What think’st thou?</p>

<p>Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too</p>

<p>young for them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  In a false quarrel there is no true valor. I</p>

<p>came to seek you both.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  We have been up and down to seek thee, for</p>

<p>we are high-proof melancholy and would fain have</p>

<p>it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy wit?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  It is in my scabbard. Shall I draw it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Never any did so, though very many have</p>

<p>been beside their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do</p>

<p>the minstrels: draw to pleasure us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  As I am an honest man, he looks pale.–Art</p>

<p>thou sick, or angry?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc> <i>[to Benedick]</i>  What, courage, man! What</p>

<p>though care killed a cat? Thou hast mettle enough</p>

<p>in thee to kill care.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, an</p>

<p>you charge it against me. I pray you, choose another</p>

<p>subject.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc> <i>[to Prince]</i>  Nay, then, give him another staff.</p>

<p>This last was broke ’cross.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  By this light, he changes more and more. I</p>

<p>think he be angry indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Shall I speak a word in your ear?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  God bless me from a challenge!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc> <i>[aside to Claudio]</i>  You are a villain. I jest</p>

<p>not. I will make it good how you dare, with what you</p>

<p>dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will</p>

<p>protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet</p>

<p>lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me</p>

<p>hear from you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Well, I will meet you, so I may have good</p>

<p>cheer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What, a feast, a feast?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  I’ faith, I thank him. He hath bid me to a</p>

<p>calf’s head and a capon, the which if I do not carve</p>

<p>most curiously, say my knife’s naught. Shall I not</p>

<p>find a woodcock too?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I’ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the</p>

<p>other day. I said thou hadst a fine wit. “True,” said</p>

<p>she, “a fine little one.” “No,” said I, “a great wit.”</p>

<p>“Right,” says she, “a great gross one.” “Nay,” said I,</p>

<p>“a good wit.” “Just,” said she, “it hurts nobody.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said I, “the gentleman is wise.” “Certain,”</p>

<p>said she, “a wise gentleman.” “Nay,” said I, “he</p>

<p>hath the tongues.” “That I believe,” said she, “for he</p>

<p>swore a thing to me on Monday night which he</p>

<p>forswore on Tuesday morning; there’s a double</p>

<p>tongue, there’s two tongues.” Thus did she an hour</p>

<p>together transshape thy particular virtues. Yet at</p>

<p>last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the</p>

<p>proper’st man in Italy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  For the which she wept heartily and said she</p>

<p>cared not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Yea, that she did. But yet for all that, an if she</p>

<p>did not hate him deadly, she would love him</p>

<p>dearly. The old man’s daughter told us all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  All, all. And, moreover, God saw him when</p>

<p>he was hid in the garden.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  But when shall we set the savage bull’s horns</p>

<p>on the sensible Benedick’s head?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Yea, and text underneath: “Here dwells Benedick,</p>

<p>the married man”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Fare you well, boy. You know my mind. I</p>

<p>will leave you now to your gossip-like humor. You</p>

<p>break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God</p>

<p>be thanked, hurt not.–My lord, for your many</p>

<p>courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your</p>

<p>company. Your brother the Bastard is fled from</p>

<p>Messina. You have among you killed a sweet and</p>

<p>innocent lady. For my Lord Lackbeard there, he and</p>

<p>I shall meet, and till then peace be with him.</p>

<p><center><i>[Benedick exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  He is in earnest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  In most profound earnest, and, I’ll warrant</p>

<p>you, for the love of Beatrice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  And hath challenged thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Most sincerely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his</p>

<p>doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape</p>

<p>a doctor to such a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  But soft you, let me be. Pluck up, my heart,</p>

<p>and be sad. Did he not say my brother was fled?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Constables Dogberry and Verges, and the Watch,</p>

<p>with Conrade and Borachio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Come you, sir. If justice cannot tame you,</p>

<p>she shall ne’er weigh more reasons in her balance.</p>

<p>Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must</p>

<p>be looked to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  How now, two of my brother’s men bound?</p>

<p>Borachio one!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Hearken after their offense, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Officers, what offense have these men done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Marry, sir, they have committed false</p>

<p>report; moreover, they have spoken untruths;</p>

<p>secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they</p>

<p>have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust</p>

<p>things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I</p>

<p>ask thee what’s their offense; sixth and lastly, why</p>

<p>they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay</p>

<p>to their charge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Rightly reasoned, and in his own division;</p>

<p>and, by my troth, there’s one meaning well suited.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[to Borachio and Conrade]</i>  Who have you offended,</p>

<p>masters, that you are thus bound to your</p>

<p>answer? This learned constable is too cunning to be</p>

<p>understood. What’s your offense?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine</p>

<p>answer. Do you hear me, and let this count kill me.</p>

<p>I have deceived even your very eyes. What your</p>

<p>wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools</p>

<p>have brought to light, who in the night overheard</p>

<p>me confessing to this man how Don John your</p>

<p>brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero, how</p>

<p>you were brought into the orchard and saw me</p>

<p>court Margaret in Hero’s garments, how you disgraced</p>

<p>her when you should marry her. My villainy</p>

<p>they have upon record, which I had rather seal with</p>

<p>my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is</p>

<p>dead upon mine and my master’s false accusation.</p>

<p>And, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a</p>

<p>villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[to Claudio]</i></p>

<p>Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc> <i>[to Borachio]</i></p>

<p>But did my brother set thee on to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Yea, and paid me richly for the practice of</p>

<p>it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>He is composed and framed of treachery,</p>

<p>And fled he is upon this villainy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appear</p>

<p>In the rare semblance that I loved it first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Come, bring away the plaintiffs. By this</p>

<p>time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of</p>

<p>the matter. And, masters, do not forget to specify,</p>

<p>when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato,</p>

<p>and the Sexton too.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Leonato, his brother, and the Sexton.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Which is the villain? Let me see his eyes,</p>

<p>That, when I note another man like him,</p>

<p>I may avoid him. Which of these is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc></p>

<p>If you would know your wronger, look on me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed</p>

<p>Mine innocent child?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Yea, even I alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>No, not so, villain, thou beliest thyself.</p>

<p>Here stand a pair of honorable men–</p>

<p>A third is fled–that had a hand in it.–</p>

<p>I thank you, princes, for my daughter’s death.</p>

<p>Record it with your high and worthy deeds.</p>

<p>’Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>I know not how to pray your patience,</p>

<p>Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself.</p>

<p>Impose me to what penance your invention</p>

<p>Can lay upon my sin. Yet sinned I not</p>

<p>But in mistaking.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  By my soul, nor I,</p>

<p>And yet to satisfy this good old man</p>

<p>I would bend under any heavy weight</p>

<p>That he’ll enjoin me to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>I cannot bid you bid my daughter live–</p>

<p>That were impossible–but, I pray you both,</p>

<p>Possess the people in Messina here</p>

<p>How innocent she died. And if your love</p>

<p>Can labor aught in sad invention,</p>

<p>Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb</p>

<p>And sing it to her bones. Sing it tonight.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning come you to my house,</p>

<p>And since you could not be my son-in-law,</p>

<p>Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter,</p>

<p>Almost the copy of my child that’s dead,</p>

<p>And she alone is heir to both of us.</p>

<p>Give her the right you should have giv’n her cousin,</p>

<p>And so dies my revenge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  O, noble sir!</p>

<p>Your overkindness doth wring tears from me.</p>

<p>I do embrace your offer and dispose</p>

<p>For henceforth of poor Claudio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Tomorrow then I will expect your coming.</p>

<p>Tonight I take my leave. This naughty man</p>

<p>Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,</p>

<p>Who I believe was packed in all this wrong,</p>

<p>Hired to it by your brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  No, by my soul, she was not,</p>

<p>Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,</p>

<p>But always hath been just and virtuous</p>

<p>In anything that I do know by her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc> <i>[to Leonato]</i>  Moreover, sir, which indeed is</p>

<p>not under white and black, this plaintiff here, the</p>

<p>offender, did call me ass. I beseech you, let it be</p>

<p>remembered in his punishment. And also the watch</p>

<p>heard them talk of one Deformed. They say he</p>

<p>wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it and</p>

<p>borrows money in God’s name, the which he hath</p>

<p>used so long and never paid that now men grow</p>

<p>hardhearted and will lend nothing for God’s sake.</p>

<p>Pray you, examine him upon that point.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Your Worship speaks like a most thankful</p>

<p>and reverent youth, and I praise God for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc> <i>[giving him money]</i>  There’s for thy pains.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  God save the foundation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I</p>

<p>thank thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  I leave an arrant knave with your Worship,</p>

<p>which I beseech your Worship to correct</p>

<p>yourself, for the example of others. God keep your</p>

<p>Worship! I wish your Worship well. God restore you</p>

<p>to health. I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a</p>

<p>merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it.–</p>

<p>Come, neighbor.     <i><i>[Dogberry and Verges exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Until tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato’s</sc> <sc>Brother</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, my lords. We look for you tomorrow.</p>
