<p><center><i>[Enter Leonato, and Dogberry, the Constable, and</p>

<p>Verges, the Headborough.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  What would you with me, honest neighbor?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Marry, sir, I would have some confidence</p>

<p>with you that decerns you nearly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Brief, I pray you, for you see it is a busy time</p>

<p>with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Marry, this it is, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  Yes, in truth, it is, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  What is it, my good friends?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the</p>

<p>matter. An old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt</p>

<p>as, God help, I would desire they were, but, in faith,</p>

<p>honest as the skin between his brows.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man</p>

<p>living that is an old man and no honester than I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Comparisons are odorous. Palabras, neighbor</p>

<p>Verges.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Neighbors, you are tedious.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  It pleases your Worship to say so, but we</p>

<p>are the poor duke’s officers. But truly, for mine</p>

<p>own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find</p>

<p>in my heart to bestow it all of your Worship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  All thy tediousness on me, ah?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Yea, an ’twere a thousand pound more</p>

<p>than ’tis, for I hear as good exclamation on your</p>

<p>Worship as of any man in the city, and though I be</p>

<p>but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  And so am I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  I would fain know what you have to say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  Marry, sir, our watch tonight, excepting your</p>

<p>Worship’s presence, ha’ ta’en a couple of as arrant</p>

<p>knaves as any in Messina.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  A good old man, sir. He will be talking. As</p>

<p>they say, “When the age is in, the wit is out.” God</p>

<p>help us, it is a world to see!–Well said, i’ faith,</p>

<p>neighbor Verges.–Well, God’s a good man. An two</p>

<p>men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An</p>

<p>honest soul, i’ faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever</p>

<p>broke bread, but God is to be worshiped, all men</p>

<p>are not alike, alas, good neighbor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Indeed, neighbor, he comes too short of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Gifts that God gives.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  I must leave you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  One word, sir. Our watch, sir, have indeed</p>

<p>comprehended two aspicious persons, and we</p>

<p>would have them this morning examined before</p>

<p>your Worship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Take their examination yourself and bring it</p>

<p>me. I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  It shall be suffigance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Drink some wine ere you go. Fare you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  My lord, they stay for you to give your</p>

<p>daughter to her husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  I’ll wait upon them. I am ready.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits, with the Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis</p>

<p>Seacoal. Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the</p>

<p>jail. We are now to examination these men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Verges</sc>  And we must do it wisely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Dogberry</sc>  We will spare for no wit, I warrant you.</p>

<p>Here’s that shall drive some of them to a noncome.</p>

<p>Only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication</p>

<p>and meet me at the jail.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
