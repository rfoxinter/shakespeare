<p><center><i>[Enter Leonato, Benedick, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula,</p>

<p>Leonato’s brother, Friar, Hero.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span></p>

<p>Did I not tell you she was innocent?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span></p>

<p>So are the Prince and Claudio, who accused her</p>

<p>Upon the error that you heard debated.</p>

<p>But Margaret was in some fault for this,</p>

<p>Although against her will, as it appears</p>

<p>In the true course of all the question.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato’s</span> <span class='sc'>Brother</span></p>

<p>Well, I am glad that all things sorts so well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span></p>

<p>And so am I, being else by faith enforced</p>

<p>To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span></p>

<p>Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all,</p>

<p>Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,</p>

<p>And when I send for you, come hither masked.</p>

<p>The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour</p>

<p>To visit me.–You know your office, brother.</p>

<p>You must be father to your brother’s daughter,</p>

<p>And give her to young Claudio.     <i><i>[The ladies exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato’s</span> <span class='sc'>Brother</span></p>

<p>Which I will do with confirmed countenance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span></p>

<p>Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span>  To do what, signior?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span></p>

<p>To bind me, or undo me, one of them.–</p>

<p>Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,</p>

<p>Your niece regards me with an eye of favor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span></p>

<p>That eye my daughter lent her; ’tis most true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span></p>

<p>And I do with an eye of love requite her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span></p>

<p>The sight whereof I think you had from me,</p>

<p>From Claudio, and the Prince. But what’s your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span></p>

<p>Your answer, sir, is enigmatical.</p>

<p>But for my will, my will is your goodwill</p>

<p>May stand with ours, this day to be conjoined</p>

<p>In the state of honorable marriage–</p>

<p>In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span></p>

<p>My heart is with your liking.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span>  And my help.</p>

<p>Here comes the Prince and Claudio.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Prince, and Claudio, and two or three other.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Good morrow to this fair assembly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio.</p>

<p>We here attend you. Are you yet determined</p>

<p>Today to marry with my brother’s daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>I’ll hold my mind were she an Ethiope.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span></p>

<p>Call her forth, brother. Here’s the Friar ready.</p>

<p><center><i>[Leonato’s brother exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what’s the matter</p>

<p>That you have such a February face,</p>

<p>So full of frost, of storm, and cloudiness?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>I think he thinks upon the savage bull.</p>

<p>Tush, fear not, man. We’ll tip thy horns with gold,</p>

<p>And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,</p>

<p>As once Europa did at lusty Jove</p>

<p>When he would play the noble beast in love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span></p>

<p>Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low,</p>

<p>And some such strange bull leapt your father’s cow</p>

<p>And got a calf in that same noble feat</p>

<p>Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>For this I owe you. Here comes other reck’nings.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Leonato’s brother, Hero, Beatrice, Margaret,</p>

<p>Ursula, the ladies masked.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Which is the lady I must seize upon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span></p>

<p>This same is she, and I do give you her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>Why, then, she’s mine.–Sweet, let me see your face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span></p>

<p>No, that you shall not till you take her hand</p>

<p>Before this friar and swear to marry her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span> <i>[to Hero]</i></p>

<p>Give me your hand before this holy friar.</p>

<p><center><i>[They take hands.]</i></center></p>

<p>I am your husband, if you like of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span></p>

<p>And when I lived, I was your other wife,</p>

<p>And when you loved, you were my other husband.</p>

<p><center><i>[She unmasks.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>Another Hero!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  Nothing certainer.</p>

<p>One Hero died defiled, but I do live,</p>

<p>And surely as I live, I am a maid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>The former Hero! Hero that is dead!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span></p>

<p>She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Friar</span></p>

<p>All this amazement can I qualify,</p>

<p>When after that the holy rites are ended,</p>

<p>I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death.</p>

<p>Meantime let wonder seem familiar,</p>

<p>And to the chapel let us presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span></p>

<p>Soft and fair, friar.–Which is Beatrice?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span> <i>[unmasking]</i></p>

<p>I answer to that name. What is your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span></p>

<p>Do not you love me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Why no, no more than reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span></p>

<p>Why then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio</p>

<p>Have been deceived. They swore you did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span></p>

<p>Do not you love me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Troth, no, no more than reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span></p>

<p>Why then, my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula</p>

<p>Are much deceived, for they did swear you did.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span></p>

<p>They swore that you were almost sick for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span></p>

<p>They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span></p>

<p>’Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span></p>

<p>No, truly, but in friendly recompense.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span></p>

<p>Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>And I’ll be sworn upon ’t that he loves her,</p>

<p>For here’s a paper written in his hand,</p>

<p>A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,</p>

<p>Fashioned to Beatrice.     <i><i>[He shows a paper.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  And here’s another,</p>

<p>Writ in my cousin’s hand, stol’n from her pocket,</p>

<p>Containing her affection unto Benedick.</p>

<p><center><i>[She shows a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  A miracle! Here’s our own hands against</p>

<p>our hearts. Come, I will have thee, but by this light</p>

<p>I take thee for pity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  I would not deny you, but by this good day, I</p>

<p>yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your</p>

<p>life, for I was told you were in a consumption.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Peace! I will stop your mouth.</p>

<p><center><i>[They kiss.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  I’ll tell thee what, prince: a college of</p>

<p>wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humor.</p>

<p>Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram?</p>

<p>No. If a man will be beaten with brains, he shall</p>

<p>wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I</p>

<p>do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any</p>

<p>purpose that the world can say against it, and</p>

<p>therefore never flout at me for what I have said</p>

<p>against it. For man is a giddy thing, and this is my</p>

<p>conclusion.–For thy part, Claudio, I did think to</p>

<p>have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my</p>

<p>kinsman, live unbruised, and love my cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied</p>

<p>Beatrice, that I might have cudgeled thee out of thy</p>

<p>single life, to make thee a double-dealer, which out</p>

<p>of question thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look</p>

<p>exceeding narrowly to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Come, come, we are friends. Let’s have a</p>

<p>dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our</p>

<p>own hearts and our wives’ heels.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  We’ll have dancing afterward.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  First, of my word! Therefore play, music.–</p>

<p>Prince, thou art sad. Get thee a wife, get thee a wife.</p>

<p>There is no staff more reverend than one tipped</p>

<p>with horn.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span> <i>[to Prince]</i></p>

<p>My lord, your brother John is ta’en in flight,</p>

<p>And brought with armed men back to Messina.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span> <i>[to Prince]</i>  Think not on him till tomorrow.</p>

<p>I’ll devise thee brave punishments for him.–Strike</p>

<p>up, pipers!     <i><i>[Music plays. They dance.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
