<p><center><i>[Enter Prince, Claudio, Benedick, and Leonato.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I do but stay till your marriage be consummate,</p>

<p>and then go I toward Aragon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  I’ll bring you thither, my lord, if you’ll vouchsafe</p>

<p>me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new</p>

<p>gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new</p>

<p>coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold</p>

<p>with Benedick for his company, for from the crown</p>

<p>of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth. He</p>

<p>hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bowstring, and the</p>

<p>little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a</p>

<p>heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the</p>

<p>clapper, for what his heart thinks, his tongue</p>

<p>speaks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Gallants, I am not as I have been.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  So say I. Methinks you are sadder.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  I hope he be in love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Hang him, truant! There’s no true drop of</p>

<p>blood in him to be truly touched with love. If he be</p>

<p>sad, he wants money.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  I have the toothache.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Draw it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Hang it!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What, sigh for the toothache?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Where is but a humor or a worm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Well, everyone can master a grief but he</p>

<p>that has it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Yet say I, he is in love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless</p>

<p>it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as to</p>

<p>be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman tomorrow, or</p>

<p>in the shape of two countries at once, as a German</p>

<p>from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard</p>

<p>from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a</p>

<p>fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no</p>

<p>fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  If he be not in love with some woman, there</p>

<p>is no believing old signs. He brushes his hat o’</p>

<p>mornings. What should that bode?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Hath any man seen him at the barber’s?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  No, but the barber’s man hath been seen</p>

<p>with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath</p>

<p>already stuffed tennis balls.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the</p>

<p>loss of a beard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Nay, he rubs himself with civet. Can you smell</p>

<p>him out by that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  That’s as much as to say, the sweet youth’s in</p>

<p>love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  The greatest note of it is his melancholy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  And when was he wont to wash his face?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Yea, or to paint himself? For the which I hear</p>

<p>what they say of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept</p>

<p>into a lute string and now governed by stops–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude,</p>

<p>conclude, he is in love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Nay, but I know who loves him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  That would I know, too. I warrant, one that</p>

<p>knows him not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of</p>

<p>all, dies for him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  She shall be buried with her face upwards.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Yet is this no charm for the toothache.–</p>

<p>Old signior, walk aside with me. I have studied eight</p>

<p>or nine wise words to speak to you, which these</p>

<p>hobby-horses must not hear.</p>

<p><center><i>[Benedick and Leonato exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  For my life, to break with him about Beatrice!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  ’Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this</p>

<p>played their parts with Beatrice, and then the two</p>

<p>bears will not bite one another when they meet.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter John the Bastard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  My lord and brother, God save you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Good e’en, brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  If your leisure served, I would speak with</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  In private?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  If it please you. Yet Count Claudio may</p>

<p>hear, for what I would speak of concerns him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc> <i>[to Claudio]</i>  Means your Lordship to be</p>

<p>married tomorrow?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  You know he does.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  I know not that, when he knows what I</p>

<p>know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  If there be any impediment, I pray you discover</p>

<p>it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  You may think I love you not. Let that</p>

<p>appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I</p>

<p>now will manifest. For my brother, I think he holds</p>

<p>you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect</p>

<p>your ensuing marriage–surely suit ill spent and</p>

<p>labor ill bestowed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  Why, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances</p>

<p>shortened, for she has been too long</p>

<p>a-talking of, the lady is disloyal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Who, Hero?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  Even she: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every</p>

<p>man’s Hero.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Disloyal?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  The word is too good to paint out her</p>

<p>wickedness. I could say she were worse. Think you</p>

<p>of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not</p>

<p>till further warrant. Go but with me tonight, you</p>

<p>shall see her chamber window entered, even the</p>

<p>night before her wedding day. If you love her then,</p>

<p>tomorrow wed her. But it would better fit your</p>

<p>honor to change your mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc> <i>[to Prince]</i>  May this be so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  I will not think it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  If you dare not trust that you see, confess</p>

<p>not that you know. If you will follow me, I will</p>

<p>show you enough, and when you have seen more</p>

<p>and heard more, proceed accordingly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  If I see anything tonight why I should not</p>

<p>marry her, tomorrow in the congregation, where I</p>

<p>should wed, there will I shame her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  And as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will</p>

<p>join with thee to disgrace her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  I will disparage her no farther till you are</p>

<p>my witnesses. Bear it coldly but till midnight, and</p>

<p>let the issue show itself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  O day untowardly turned!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  O mischief strangely thwarting!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  O plague right well prevented! So will you</p>

<p>say when you have seen the sequel.</p>
