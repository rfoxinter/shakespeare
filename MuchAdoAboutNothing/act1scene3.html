<p><center><i>[Enter Sir John the Bastard, and Conrade, his</p>

<p>companion.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  What the goodyear, my lord, why are you</p>

<p>thus out of measure sad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  There is no measure in the occasion that</p>

<p>breeds. Therefore the sadness is without limit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  You should hear reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  And when I have heard it, what blessing</p>

<p>brings it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  If not a present remedy, at least a patient</p>

<p>sufferance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayst thou</p>

<p>art, born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral</p>

<p>medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide</p>

<p>what I am. I must be sad when I have cause, and</p>

<p>smile at no man’s jests; eat when I have stomach,</p>

<p>and wait for no man’s leisure; sleep when I am</p>

<p>drowsy, and tend on no man’s business; laugh when</p>

<p>I am merry, and claw no man in his humor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  Yea, but you must not make the full show of</p>

<p>this till you may do it without controlment. You</p>

<p>have of late stood out against your brother, and he</p>

<p>hath ta’en you newly into his grace, where it is</p>

<p>impossible you should take true root but by the fair</p>

<p>weather that you make yourself. It is needful that</p>

<p>you frame the season for your own harvest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a</p>

<p>rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be</p>

<p>disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob</p>

<p>love from any. In this, though I cannot be said to be</p>

<p>a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I</p>

<p>am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a</p>

<p>muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I</p>

<p>have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my</p>

<p>mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do</p>

<p>my liking. In the meantime, let me be that I am, and</p>

<p>seek not to alter me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  Can you make no use of your discontent?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who</p>

<p>comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Borachio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What news, Borachio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  I came yonder from a great supper. The</p>

<p>Prince your brother is royally entertained by</p>

<p>Leonato, and I can give you intelligence of an</p>

<p>intended marriage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  Will it serve for any model to build mischief</p>

<p>on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to</p>

<p>unquietness?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  Who, the most exquisite Claudio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Even he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  A proper squire. And who, and who? Which</p>

<p>way looks he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of</p>

<p>Leonato.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  A very forward March chick! How came you</p>

<p>to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was</p>

<p>smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and</p>

<p>Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference. I</p>

<p>whipped me behind the arras, and there heard it</p>

<p>agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for</p>

<p>himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count</p>

<p>Claudio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  Come, come, let us thither. This may prove</p>

<p>food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath</p>

<p>all the glory of my overthrow. If I can cross him any</p>

<p>way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and</p>

<p>will assist me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Conrade</sc>  To the death, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc>  Let us to the great supper. Their cheer is the</p>

<p>greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were o’</p>

<p>my mind! Shall we go prove what’s to be done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Borachio</sc>  We’ll wait upon your Lordship.</p>
