<p><center><i>[Enter Prince, John the Bastard, Leonato, Friar,</p>

<p>Claudio, Benedick, Hero, and Beatrice, with</p>

<p>Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Come, Friar Francis, be brief, only to the</p>

<p>plain form of marriage, and you shall recount their</p>

<p>particular duties afterwards.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <i>[to Claudio]</i>  You come hither, my lord, to marry</p>

<p>this lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  To be married to her.–Friar, you come to</p>

<p>marry her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc>  Lady, you come hither to be married to this</p>

<p>count?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hero</sc>  I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc>  If either of you know any inward impediment</p>

<p>why you should not be conjoined, I charge you on</p>

<p>your souls to utter it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Know you any, Hero?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hero</sc>  None, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc>  Know you any, count?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  I dare make his answer, none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  O, what men dare do! What men may do!</p>

<p>What men daily do, not knowing what they do!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  How now, interjections? Why, then, some</p>

<p>be of laughing, as ah, ha, he!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>Stand thee by, friar.–Father, by your leave,</p>

<p>Will you with free and unconstrained soul</p>

<p>Give me this maid, your daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>As freely, son, as God did give her me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>And what have I to give you back whose worth</p>

<p>May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Nothing, unless you render her again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.–</p>

<p>There, Leonato, take her back again.</p>

<p>Give not this rotten orange to your friend.</p>

<p>She’s but the sign and semblance of her honor.</p>

<p>Behold how like a maid she blushes here!</p>

<p>O, what authority and show of truth</p>

<p>Can cunning sin cover itself withal!</p>

<p>Comes not that blood as modest evidence</p>

<p>To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,</p>

<p>All you that see her, that she were a maid,</p>

<p>By these exterior shows? But she is none.</p>

<p>She knows the heat of a luxurious bed.</p>

<p>Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>What do you mean, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Not to be married,</p>

<p>Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Dear my lord, if you in your own proof</p>

<p>Have vanquished the resistance of her youth,</p>

<p>And made defeat of her virginity–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>I know what you would say: if I have known her,</p>

<p>You will say she did embrace me as a husband,</p>

<p>And so extenuate the forehand sin.</p>

<p>No, Leonato,</p>

<p>I never tempted her with word too large,</p>

<p>But, as a brother to his sister, showed</p>

<p>Bashful sincerity and comely love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hero</sc></p>

<p>And seemed I ever otherwise to you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>Out on thee, seeming! I will write against it.</p>

<p>You seem to me as Dian in her orb,</p>

<p>As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown.</p>

<p>But you are more intemperate in your blood</p>

<p>Than Venus, or those pampered animals</p>

<p>That rage in savage sensuality.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hero</sc></p>

<p>Is my lord well that he doth speak so wide?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Sweet prince, why speak not you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc>  What should I</p>

<p>speak?</p>

<p>I stand dishonored that have gone about</p>

<p>To link my dear friend to a common stale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  This looks not like a nuptial.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hero</sc>  True! O God!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Leonato, stand I here?</p>

<p>Is this the Prince? Is this the Prince’s brother?</p>

<p>Is this face Hero’s? Are our eyes our own?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>All this is so, but what of this, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>Let me but move one question to your daughter,</p>

<p>And by that fatherly and kindly power</p>

<p>That you have in her, bid her answer truly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hero</sc></p>

<p>O, God defend me, how am I beset!–</p>

<p>What kind of catechizing call you this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>To make you answer truly to your name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hero</sc></p>

<p>Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name</p>

<p>With any just reproach?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc>  Marry, that can Hero!</p>

<p>Hero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue.</p>

<p>What man was he talked with you yesternight</p>

<p>Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?</p>

<p>Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hero</sc></p>

<p>I talked with no man at that hour, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prince</sc></p>

<p>Why, then, are you no maiden.–Leonato,</p>

<p>I am sorry you must hear. Upon mine honor,</p>

<p>Myself, my brother, and this grieved count</p>

<p>Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night</p>

<p>Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window,</p>

<p>Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,</p>

<p>Confessed the vile encounters they have had</p>

<p>A thousand times in secret.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Fie, fie, they are not to be named, my lord,</p>

<p>Not to be spoke of!</p>

<p>There is not chastity enough in language,</p>

<p>Without offense, to utter them.–Thus, pretty lady,</p>

<p>I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Claudio</sc></p>

<p>O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been</p>

<p>If half thy outward graces had been placed</p>

<p>About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!</p>

<p>But fare thee well, most foul, most fair. Farewell,</p>

<p>Thou pure impiety and impious purity.</p>

<p>For thee I’ll lock up all the gates of love</p>

<p>And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,</p>

<p>To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,</p>

<p>And never shall it more be gracious.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Hath no man’s dagger here a point for me?</p>

<p><center><i>[Hero falls.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc></p>

<p>Why, how now, cousin, wherefore sink you down?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Don</sc> <sc>John</sc></p>

<p>Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,</p>

<p>Smother her spirits up.</p>

<p><center><i>[Claudio, Prince, and Don John exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc></p>

<p>How doth the lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Dead, I think.–Help, uncle!–</p>

<p>Hero, why Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>O Fate, take not away thy heavy hand!</p>

<p>Death is the fairest cover for her shame</p>

<p>That may be wished for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  How now, cousin Hero?     <i><i>[Hero stirs.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc> <i>[to Hero]</i>  Have comfort, lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc> <i>[to Hero]</i></p>

<p>Dost thou look up?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc>  Yea, wherefore should she not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Wherefore? Why, doth not every earthly thing</p>

<p>Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny</p>

<p>The story that is printed in her blood?–</p>

<p>Do not live, Hero, do not ope thine eyes,</p>

<p>For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,</p>

<p>Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,</p>

<p>Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,</p>

<p>Strike at thy life. Grieved I I had but one?</p>

<p>Chid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame?</p>

<p>O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?</p>

<p>Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?</p>

<p>Why had I not with charitable hand</p>

<p>Took up a beggar’s issue at my gates,</p>

<p>Who, smirched thus, and mired with infamy,</p>

<p>I might have said “No part of it is mine;</p>

<p>This shame derives itself from unknown loins”?</p>

<p>But mine, and mine I loved, and mine I praised,</p>

<p>And mine that I was proud on, mine so much</p>

<p>That I myself was to myself not mine,</p>

<p>Valuing of her–why she, O she, is fall’n</p>

<p>Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea</p>

<p>Hath drops too few to wash her clean again,</p>

<p>And salt too little which may season give</p>

<p>To her foul tainted flesh!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Sir, sir, be patient.</p>

<p>For my part, I am so attired in wonder</p>

<p>I know not what to say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc></p>

<p>O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc></p>

<p>Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc></p>

<p>No, truly not, although until last night</p>

<p>I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>Confirmed, confirmed! O, that is stronger made</p>

<p>Which was before barred up with ribs of iron!</p>

<p>Would the two princes lie and Claudio lie,</p>

<p>Who loved her so that, speaking of her foulness,</p>

<p>Washed it with tears? Hence from her. Let her die!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc>  Hear me a little,</p>

<p>For I have only silent been so long,</p>

<p>And given way unto this course of fortune,</p>

<p>By noting of the lady. I have marked</p>

<p>A thousand blushing apparitions</p>

<p>To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames</p>

<p>In angel whiteness beat away those blushes,</p>

<p>And in her eye there hath appeared a fire</p>

<p>To burn the errors that these princes hold</p>

<p>Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool,</p>

<p>Trust not my reading nor my observations,</p>

<p>Which with experimental seal doth warrant</p>

<p>The tenor of my book; trust not my age,</p>

<p>My reverence, calling, nor divinity,</p>

<p>If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here</p>

<p>Under some biting error.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Friar, it cannot be.</p>

<p>Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left</p>

<p>Is that she will not add to her damnation</p>

<p>A sin of perjury. She not denies it.</p>

<p>Why seek’st thou then to cover with excuse</p>

<p>That which appears in proper nakedness?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc></p>

<p>Lady, what man is he you are accused of?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hero</sc></p>

<p>They know that do accuse me. I know none.</p>

<p>If I know more of any man alive</p>

<p>Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,</p>

<p>Let all my sins lack mercy!–O my father,</p>

<p>Prove you that any man with me conversed</p>

<p>At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight</p>

<p>Maintained the change of words with any creature,</p>

<p>Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc></p>

<p>There is some strange misprision in the princes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc></p>

<p>Two of them have the very bent of honor,</p>

<p>And if their wisdoms be misled in this,</p>

<p>The practice of it lives in John the Bastard,</p>

<p>Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>I know not. If they speak but truth of her,</p>

<p>These hands shall tear her. If they wrong her honor,</p>

<p>The proudest of them shall well hear of it.</p>

<p>Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,</p>

<p>Nor age so eat up my invention,</p>

<p>Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,</p>

<p>Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,</p>

<p>But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,</p>

<p>Both strength of limb and policy of mind,</p>

<p>Ability in means and choice of friends,</p>

<p>To quit me of them throughly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc>  Pause awhile,</p>

<p>And let my counsel sway you in this case.</p>

<p>Your daughter here the princes left for dead.</p>

<p>Let her awhile be secretly kept in,</p>

<p>And publish it that she is dead indeed.</p>

<p>Maintain a mourning ostentation,</p>

<p>And on your family’s old monument</p>

<p>Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites</p>

<p>That appertain unto a burial.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc></p>

<p>What shall become of this? What will this do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc></p>

<p>Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf</p>

<p>Change slander to remorse. That is some good.</p>

<p>But not for that dream I on this strange course,</p>

<p>But on this travail look for greater birth.</p>

<p>She, dying, as it must be so maintained,</p>

<p>Upon the instant that she was accused,</p>

<p>Shall be lamented, pitied, and excused</p>

<p>Of every hearer. For it so falls out</p>

<p>That what we have we prize not to the worth</p>

<p>Whiles we enjoy it, but being lacked and lost,</p>

<p>Why then we rack the value, then we find</p>

<p>The virtue that possession would not show us</p>

<p>Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio.</p>

<p>When he shall hear she died upon his words,</p>

<p>Th’ idea of her life shall sweetly creep</p>

<p>Into his study of imagination,</p>

<p>And every lovely organ of her life</p>

<p>Shall come appareled in more precious habit,</p>

<p>More moving, delicate, and full of life,</p>

<p>Into the eye and prospect of his soul,</p>

<p>Than when she lived indeed. Then shall he mourn,</p>

<p>If ever love had interest in his liver,</p>

<p>And wish he had not so accused her,</p>

<p>No, though he thought his accusation true.</p>

<p>Let this be so, and doubt not but success</p>

<p>Will fashion the event in better shape</p>

<p>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.</p>

<p>But if all aim but this be leveled false,</p>

<p>The supposition of the lady’s death</p>

<p>Will quench the wonder of her infamy.</p>

<p>And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,</p>

<p>As best befits her wounded reputation,</p>

<p>In some reclusive and religious life,</p>

<p>Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc></p>

<p>Signior Leonato, let the Friar advise you.</p>

<p>And though you know my inwardness and love</p>

<p>Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio,</p>

<p>Yet, by mine honor, I will deal in this</p>

<p>As secretly and justly as your soul</p>

<p>Should with your body.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Leonato</sc>  Being that I flow in grief,</p>

<p>The smallest twine may lead me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Friar</sc></p>

<p>’Tis well consented. Presently away,</p>

<p>   <i>For to strange sores strangely they strain the</i></p>

<p>   <i>cure.–</i></p>

<p>Come, lady, die to live. This wedding day</p>

<p>   <i>Perhaps is but prolonged. Have patience and</i></p>

<p>   <i>endure.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[All but Beatrice and Benedick exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Yea, and I will weep a while longer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  I will not desire that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  You have no reason. I do it freely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Surely I do believe your fair cousin is</p>

<p>wronged.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Ah, how much might the man deserve of me</p>

<p>that would right her!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Is there any way to show such friendship?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  A very even way, but no such friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  May a man do it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  It is a man’s office, but not yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  I do love nothing in the world so well as</p>

<p>you. Is not that strange?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  As strange as the thing I know not. It were as</p>

<p>possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as you,</p>

<p>but believe me not, and yet I lie not; I confess</p>

<p>nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my</p>

<p>cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Do not swear and eat it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  I will swear by it that you love me, and I will</p>

<p>make him eat it that says I love not you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Will you not eat your word?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  With no sauce that can be devised to it. I</p>

<p>protest I love thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Why then, God forgive me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  What offense, sweet Beatrice?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  You have stayed me in a happy hour. I was</p>

<p>about to protest I loved you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  And do it with all thy heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  I love you with so much of my heart that</p>

<p>none is left to protest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Come, bid me do anything for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Kill Claudio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Ha! Not for the wide world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  You kill me to deny it. Farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[She begins to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Tarry, sweet Beatrice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  I am gone, though I am here. There is no</p>

<p>love in you. Nay, I pray you let me go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Beatrice–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  In faith, I will go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  We’ll be friends first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  You dare easier be friends with me than</p>

<p>fight with mine enemy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Is Claudio thine enemy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Is he not approved in the height a villain</p>

<p>that hath slandered, scorned, dishonored my kinswoman?</p>

<p>O, that I were a man! What, bear her in</p>

<p>hand until they come to take hands, and then, with</p>

<p>public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated</p>

<p>rancor–O God, that I were a man! I would eat his</p>

<p>heart in the marketplace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Hear me, Beatrice–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Talk with a man out at a window! A proper</p>

<p>saying.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Nay, but Beatrice–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Sweet Hero, she is wronged, she is slandered,</p>

<p>she is undone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Beat–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Princes and counties! Surely a princely testimony,</p>

<p>a goodly count, Count Comfect, a sweet</p>

<p>gallant, surely! O, that I were a man for his sake! Or</p>

<p>that I had any friend would be a man for my sake!</p>

<p>But manhood is melted into curtsies, valor into</p>

<p>compliment, and men are only turned into tongue,</p>

<p>and trim ones, too. He is now as valiant as Hercules</p>

<p>that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a man</p>

<p>with wishing; therefore I will die a woman with</p>

<p>grieving.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Use it for my love some other way than</p>

<p>swearing by it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Think you in your soul the Count Claudio</p>

<p>hath wronged Hero?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Beatrice</sc>  Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Benedick</sc>  Enough, I am engaged. I will challenge</p>

<p>him. I will kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By</p>

<p>this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account.</p>

<p>As you hear of me, so think of me. Go comfort your</p>

<p>cousin. I must say she is dead, and so farewell.</p>
