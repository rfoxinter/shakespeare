<p><center><i>[Enter Benedick and Margaret.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve</p>

<p>well at my hands by helping me to the speech of</p>

<p>Beatrice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Will you then write me a sonnet in praise</p>

<p>of my beauty?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  In so high a style, Margaret, that no man</p>

<p>living shall come over it, for in most comely truth</p>

<p>thou deservest it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  To have no man come over me? Why, shall I</p>

<p>always keep below stairs?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound’s</p>

<p>mouth; it catches.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  And yours as blunt as the fencer’s foils,</p>

<p>which hit but hurt not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt</p>

<p>a woman. And so, I pray thee, call Beatrice. I give</p>

<p>thee the bucklers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our</p>

<p>own.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  If you use them, Margaret, you must put in</p>

<p>the pikes with a vice, and they are dangerous</p>

<p>weapons for maids.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I</p>

<p>think hath legs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  And therefore will come.</p>

<p><center><i>[Margaret exits.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[Sings]</i>        <i>The god of love</i></p>

<p>        <i>That sits above,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And knows me, and knows me,</i></p>

<p>        <i>How pitiful I deserve–</i></p>

<p>I mean in singing. But in loving, Leander the good</p>

<p>swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and</p>

<p>a whole book full of these quondam carpetmongers,</p>

<p>whose names yet run smoothly in the even</p>

<p>road of a blank verse, why, they were never so truly</p>

<p>turned over and over as my poor self in love. Marry,</p>

<p>I cannot show it in rhyme. I have tried. I can find out</p>

<p>no rhyme to “lady” but “baby”–an innocent</p>

<p>rhyme; for “scorn,” “horn”–a hard rhyme; for</p>

<p>“school,” “fool”–a babbling rhyme; very ominous</p>

<p>endings. No, I was not born under a rhyming</p>

<p>planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Beatrice.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called</p>

<p>thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  O, stay but till then!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  “Then” is spoken. Fare you well now. And</p>

<p>yet, ere I go, let me go with that I came, which is,</p>

<p>with knowing what hath passed between you and</p>

<p>Claudio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Only foul words, and thereupon I will kiss</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is</p>

<p>but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome. Therefore</p>

<p>I will depart unkissed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Thou hast frighted the word out of his right</p>

<p>sense, so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee</p>

<p>plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge, and either</p>

<p>I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe</p>

<p>him a coward. And I pray thee now tell me, for</p>

<p>which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love</p>

<p>with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  For them all together, which maintained so</p>

<p>politic a state of evil that they will not admit any</p>

<p>good part to intermingle with them. But for which</p>

<p>of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Suffer love! A good epithet. I do suffer love</p>

<p>indeed, for I love thee against my will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor</p>

<p>heart, if you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for</p>

<p>yours, for I will never love that which my friend</p>

<p>hates.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  It appears not in this confession. There’s not</p>

<p>one wise man among twenty that will praise</p>

<p>himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived</p>

<p>in the time of good neighbors. If a man do not erect</p>

<p>in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no</p>

<p>longer in monument than the bell rings and the</p>

<p>widow weeps.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  And how long is that, think you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Question: why, an hour in clamor and a</p>

<p>quarter in rheum. Therefore is it most expedient for</p>

<p>the wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no</p>

<p>impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of</p>

<p>his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for</p>

<p>praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is</p>

<p>praiseworthy. And now tell me, how doth your</p>

<p>cousin?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Very ill.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  And how do you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Very ill, too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Serve God, love me, and mend. There will I</p>

<p>leave you too, for here comes one in haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ursula.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span>  Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder’s</p>

<p>old coil at home. It is proved my Lady Hero</p>

<p>hath been falsely accused, the Prince and Claudio</p>

<p>mightily abused, and Don John is the author of all,</p>

<p>who is fled and gone. Will you come presently?</p>

<p><center><i>[Ursula exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Will you go hear this news, signior?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be</p>

<p>buried in thy eyes–and, moreover, I will go with</p>

<p>thee to thy uncle’s.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
