<p><center><i>[Enter Leonato, his brother, Hero his daughter, and</p>

<p>Beatrice his niece, with Ursula and Margaret.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Was not Count John here at supper?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato’s</span> <span class='sc'>Brother</span>  I saw him not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  How tartly that gentleman looks! I never</p>

<p>can see him but I am heartburned an hour after.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  He is of a very melancholy disposition.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  He were an excellent man that were made</p>

<p>just in the midway between him and Benedick. The</p>

<p>one is too like an image and says nothing, and the</p>

<p>other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore</p>

<p>tattling.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Then half Signior Benedick’s tongue in</p>

<p>Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy</p>

<p>in Signior Benedick’s face–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and</p>

<p>money enough in his purse, such a man would win</p>

<p>any woman in the world if he could get her</p>

<p>goodwill.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a</p>

<p>husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato’s</span> <span class='sc'>Brother</span>  In faith, she’s too curst.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen</p>

<p>God’s sending that way, for it is said “God sends a</p>

<p>curst cow short horns,” but to a cow too curst, he</p>

<p>sends none.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  So, by being too curst, God will send you no</p>

<p>horns.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Just, if He send me no husband, for the</p>

<p>which blessing I am at Him upon my knees every</p>

<p>morning and evening. Lord, I could not endure a</p>

<p>husband with a beard on his face. I had rather lie in</p>

<p>the woolen!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  You may light on a husband that hath no</p>

<p>beard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  What should I do with him? Dress him in my</p>

<p>apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman?</p>

<p>He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he</p>

<p>that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is</p>

<p>more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less</p>

<p>than a man, I am not for him. Therefore I will even</p>

<p>take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd, and lead</p>

<p>his apes into hell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Well then, go you into hell?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  No, but to the gate, and there will the devil</p>

<p>meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his</p>

<p>head, and say “Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you</p>

<p>to heaven; here’s no place for you maids.” So deliver</p>

<p>I up my apes and away to Saint Peter; for the</p>

<p>heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and</p>

<p>there live we as merry as the day is long.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato’s</span> <span class='sc'>Brother</span> <i>[to Hero]</i>  Well, niece, I trust you</p>

<p>will be ruled by your father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Yes, faith, it is my cousin’s duty to make</p>

<p>curtsy and say “Father, as it please you.” But yet for</p>

<p>all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or</p>

<p>else make another curtsy and say “Father, as it</p>

<p>please me.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted</p>

<p>with a husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Not till God make men of some other metal</p>

<p>than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be</p>

<p>overmastered with a piece of valiant dust? To make</p>

<p>an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?</p>

<p>No, uncle, I’ll none. Adam’s sons are my brethren,</p>

<p>and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span> <i>[to Hero]</i>  Daughter, remember what I told</p>

<p>you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you</p>

<p>know your answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you</p>

<p>be not wooed in good time. If the Prince be too</p>

<p>important, tell him there is measure in everything,</p>

<p>and so dance out the answer. For hear me, Hero,</p>

<p>wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a</p>

<p>measure, and a cinquepace. The first suit is hot and</p>

<p>hasty like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the</p>

<p>wedding, mannerly modest as a measure, full of</p>

<p>state and ancientry; and then comes repentance,</p>

<p>and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster</p>

<p>and faster till he sink into his grave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church</p>

<p>by daylight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  The revelers are entering, brother. Make</p>

<p>good room.     <i><i>[Leonato and his brother step aside.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter, with a Drum, Prince Pedro, Claudio, and</p>

<p>Benedick, Signior Antonio, and Balthasar, all in</p>

<p>masks, with Borachio and Don John.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <i>[to Hero]</i>  Lady, will you walk a bout with your</p>

<p>friend?     <i><i>[They begin to dance.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  So you walk softly, and look sweetly, and say</p>

<p>nothing, I am yours for the walk, and especially</p>

<p>when I walk away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  With me in your company?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  I may say so when I please.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  And when please you to say so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  When I like your favor, for God defend the lute</p>

<p>should be like the case.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  My visor is Philemon’s roof; within the house</p>

<p>is Jove.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  Why, then, your visor should be thatched.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Speak low if you speak love.</p>

<p><center><i>[They move aside;</p>

<p>Benedick and Margaret move forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span> <i>[to Margaret]</i>  Well, I would you did like me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  So would not I for your own sake, for I have</p>

<p>many ill qualities.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Which is one?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  I say my prayers aloud.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  I love you the better; the hearers may cry</p>

<p>“Amen.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  God match me with a good dancer.</p>

<p><center><i>[They separate; Benedick moves aside;</p>

<p>Balthasar moves forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>  And God keep him out of my sight when the</p>

<p>dance is done. Answer, clerk.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Balthasar</span>  No more words. The clerk is answered.</p>

<p><center><i>[They move aside;</p>

<p>Ursula and Antonio move forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span>  I know you well enough. You are Signior</p>

<p>Antonio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  At a word, I am not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span>  I know you by the waggling of your head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  To tell you true, I counterfeit him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span>  You could never do him so ill-well unless you</p>

<p>were the very man. Here’s his dry hand up and</p>

<p>down. You are he, you are he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Antonio</span>  At a word, I am not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ursula</span>  Come, come, do you think I do not know you</p>

<p>by your excellent wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to,</p>

<p>mum, you are he. Graces will appear, and there’s an</p>

<p>end.</p>

<p><center><i>[They move aside;</p>

<p>Benedick and Beatrice move forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Will you not tell me who told you so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  No, you shall pardon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Nor will you not tell me who you are?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Not now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  That I was disdainful, and that I had my</p>

<p>good wit out of The Hundred Merry Tales! Well, this</p>

<p>was Signior Benedick that said so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  What’s he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  I am sure you know him well enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Not I, believe me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Did he never make you laugh?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  I pray you, what is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Why, he is the Prince’s jester, a very dull</p>

<p>fool; only his gift is in devising impossible slanders.</p>

<p>None but libertines delight in him, and the commendation</p>

<p>is not in his wit but in his villainy, for he</p>

<p>both pleases men and angers them, and then they</p>

<p>laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the</p>

<p>fleet.I would he had boarded me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  When I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him</p>

<p>what you say.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Do, do. He’ll but break a comparison or two</p>

<p>on me, which peradventure not marked or not</p>

<p>laughed at strikes him into melancholy, and then</p>

<p>there’s a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat</p>

<p>no supper that night. <i>[Music for the dance.]</i> We must</p>

<p>follow the leaders.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  In every good thing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them</p>

<p>at the next turning.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dance. Then exit all except</p>

<p>Don John, Borachio, and Claudio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span> <i>[to Borachio]</i>  Sure my brother is amorous</p>

<p>on Hero, and hath withdrawn her father to break</p>

<p>with him about it. The ladies follow her, and but one</p>

<p>visor remains.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  And that is Claudio. I know him by his</p>

<p>bearing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span> <i>[to Claudio]</i>  Are not you Signior Benedick?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  You know me well. I am he.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  Signior, you are very near my brother in his</p>

<p>love. He is enamored on Hero. I pray you dissuade</p>

<p>him from her. She is no equal for his birth. You</p>

<p>may do the part of an honest man in it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  How know you he loves her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  I heard him swear his affection.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Borachio</span>  So did I too, and he swore he would marry</p>

<p>her tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  Come, let us to the banquet.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit. Claudio remains.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span> <i>[unmasking]</i></p>

<p>Thus answer I in name of Benedick,</p>

<p>But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.</p>

<p>’Tis certain so. The Prince woos for himself.</p>

<p>Friendship is constant in all other things</p>

<p>Save in the office and affairs of love.</p>

<p>Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues.</p>

<p>Let every eye negotiate for itself</p>

<p>And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch</p>

<p>Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.</p>

<p>This is an accident of hourly proof,</p>

<p>Which I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore, Hero.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Benedick.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Count Claudio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Yea, the same.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Come, will you go with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Whither?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Even to the next willow, about your own</p>

<p>business, county. What fashion will you wear the</p>

<p>garland of? About your neck like an usurer’s chain?</p>

<p>Or under your arm like a lieutenant’s scarf? You</p>

<p>must wear it one way, for the Prince hath got your</p>

<p>Hero.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  I wish him joy of her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Why, that’s spoken like an honest drover; so</p>

<p>they sell bullocks. But did you think the Prince</p>

<p>would have served you thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  I pray you, leave me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Ho, now you strike like the blind man.</p>

<p>’Twas the boy that stole your meat, and you’ll beat</p>

<p>the post.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  If it will not be, I’ll leave you.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Alas, poor hurt fowl, now will he creep into</p>

<p>sedges. But that my Lady Beatrice should know</p>

<p>me, and not know me! The Prince’s fool! Ha, it may</p>

<p>be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but</p>

<p>so I am apt to do myself wrong. I am not so reputed!</p>

<p>It is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice</p>

<p>that puts the world into her person and so gives me</p>

<p>out. Well, I’ll be revenged as I may.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Prince, Hero, and Leonato.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Now, signior, where’s the Count? Did you see</p>

<p>him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Troth, my lord, I have played the part of</p>

<p>Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a</p>

<p>lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him</p>

<p>true, that your Grace had got the goodwill of this</p>

<p>young lady, and I offered him my company to a</p>

<p>willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being</p>

<p>forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to</p>

<p>be whipped.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  To be whipped? What’s his fault?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  The flat transgression of a schoolboy who,</p>

<p>being overjoyed with finding a bird’s nest, shows it</p>

<p>his companion, and he steals it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The</p>

<p>transgression is in the stealer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been</p>

<p>made, and the garland too, for the garland he</p>

<p>might have worn himself, and the rod he might</p>

<p>have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen</p>

<p>his bird’s nest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  I will but teach them to sing and restore them</p>

<p>to the owner.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  If their singing answer your saying, by my</p>

<p>faith, you say honestly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you. The</p>

<p>gentleman that danced with her told her she is</p>

<p>much wronged by you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  O, she misused me past the endurance of a</p>

<p>block! An oak but with one green leaf on it would</p>

<p>have answered her. My very visor began to assume</p>

<p>life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I</p>

<p>had been myself, that I was the Prince’s jester, that I</p>

<p>was duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest</p>

<p>with such impossible conveyance upon me that I</p>

<p>stood like a man at a mark with a whole army</p>

<p>shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every</p>

<p>word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her</p>

<p>terminations, there were no living near her; she</p>

<p>would infect to the North Star. I would not marry</p>

<p>her though she were endowed with all that Adam</p>

<p>had left him before he transgressed. She would have</p>

<p>made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft</p>

<p>his club to make the fire, too. Come, talk not of her.</p>

<p>You shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I</p>

<p>would to God some scholar would conjure her, for</p>

<p>certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet</p>

<p>in hell as in a sanctuary, and people sin upon</p>

<p>purpose because they would go thither. So indeed</p>

<p>all disquiet, horror, and perturbation follows her.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Claudio and Beatrice.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Look, here she comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Will your Grace command me any service</p>

<p>to the world’s end? I will go on the slightest errand</p>

<p>now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send</p>

<p>me on. I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the</p>

<p>furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of Prester</p>

<p>John’s foot, fetch you a hair off the great Cham’s</p>

<p>beard, do you any embassage to the Pygmies, rather</p>

<p>than hold three words’ conference with this harpy.</p>

<p>You have no employment for me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  None but to desire your good company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  O God, sir, here’s a dish I love not! I cannot</p>

<p>endure my Lady Tongue.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <i>[to Beatrice]</i>  Come, lady, come, you have lost</p>

<p>the heart of Signior Benedick.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile, and I</p>

<p>gave him use for it, a double heart for his single</p>

<p>one. Marry, once before he won it of me with false</p>

<p>dice. Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost</p>

<p>it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  You have put him down, lady, you have put</p>

<p>him down.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  So I would not he should do me, my lord,</p>

<p>lest I should prove the mother of fools. I have</p>

<p>brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Why, how now, count, wherefore are you sad?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Not sad, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  How then, sick?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Neither, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry,</p>

<p>nor well, but civil count, civil as an orange, and</p>

<p>something of that jealous complexion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  I’ faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true,</p>

<p>though I’ll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is</p>

<p>false.–Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name,</p>

<p>and fair Hero is won. I have broke with her father</p>

<p>and his goodwill obtained. Name the day of marriage,</p>

<p>and God give thee joy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Count, take of me my daughter, and with her</p>

<p>my fortunes. His Grace hath made the match, and</p>

<p>all grace say “Amen” to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Speak, count, ’tis your cue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Silence is the perfectest herald of joy. I were</p>

<p>but little happy if I could say how much.–Lady, as</p>

<p>you are mine, I am yours. I give away myself for you</p>

<p>and dote upon the exchange.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Speak, cousin, or, if you cannot, stop his</p>

<p>mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Yea, my lord. I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on</p>

<p>the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his ear</p>

<p>that he is in her heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  And so she doth, cousin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Good Lord for alliance! Thus goes everyone</p>

<p>to the world but I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a</p>

<p>corner and cry “Heigh-ho for a husband!”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  I would rather have one of your father’s</p>

<p>getting. Hath your Grace ne’er a brother like you?</p>

<p>Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could</p>

<p>come by them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Will you have me, lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  No, my lord, unless I might have another for</p>

<p>working days. Your Grace is too costly to wear</p>

<p>every day. But I beseech your Grace pardon me. I</p>

<p>was born to speak all mirth and no matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Your silence most offends me, and to be merry</p>

<p>best becomes you, for out o’ question you were</p>

<p>born in a merry hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  No, sure, my lord, my mother cried, but then</p>

<p>there was a star danced, and under that was I</p>

<p>born.–Cousins, God give you joy!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Niece, will you look to those things I told</p>

<p>you of?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  I cry you mercy, uncle.–By your Grace’s</p>

<p>pardon.     <i><i>[Beatrice exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  There’s little of the melancholy element in</p>

<p>her, my lord. She is never sad but when she sleeps,</p>

<p>and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter</p>

<p>say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness and</p>

<p>waked herself with laughing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  O, by no means. She mocks all her wooers</p>

<p>out of suit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  She were an excellent wife for Benedick.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week</p>

<p>married, they would talk themselves mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  County Claudio, when mean you to go to</p>

<p>church?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Tomorrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches</p>

<p>till love have all his rites.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence</p>

<p>a just sevennight, and a time too brief, too, to have</p>

<p>all things answer my mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span> <i>[to Claudio]</i>  Come, you shake the head at so</p>

<p>long a breathing, but I warrant thee, Claudio, the</p>

<p>time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim</p>

<p>undertake one of Hercules’ labors, which is to bring</p>

<p>Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a</p>

<p>mountain of affection, th’ one with th’ other. I</p>

<p>would fain have it a match, and I doubt not but to</p>

<p>fashion it, if you three will but minister such</p>

<p>assistance as I shall give you direction.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten</p>

<p>nights’ watchings.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  And I, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  And you too, gentle Hero?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my</p>

<p>cousin to a good husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband</p>

<p>that I know. Thus far can I praise him: he is of</p>

<p>a noble strain, of approved valor, and confirmed</p>

<p>honesty. I will teach you how to humor your</p>

<p>cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick.–</p>

<p>And I, with your two helps, will so practice on</p>

<p>Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his</p>

<p>queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice.</p>

<p>If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer; his</p>

<p>glory shall be ours, for we are the only love gods. Go</p>

<p>in with me, and I will tell you my drift.</p>
