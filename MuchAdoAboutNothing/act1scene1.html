<p><center><i>[Enter Leonato, Governor of Messina, Hero his daughter,</p>

<p>and Beatrice his niece, with a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span> <i>[with a letter]</i>  I learn in this letter that Don</p>

<p>Pedro of Aragon comes this night to Messina.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  He is very near by this. He was not three</p>

<p>leagues off when I left him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  How many gentlemen have you lost in this</p>

<p>action?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  But few of any sort, and none of name.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  A victory is twice itself when the achiever</p>

<p>brings home full numbers. I find here that Don</p>

<p>Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young</p>

<p>Florentine called Claudio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Much deserved on his part, and equally</p>

<p>remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself</p>

<p>beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure</p>

<p>of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better</p>

<p>bettered expectation than you must expect of me to</p>

<p>tell you how.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  He hath an uncle here in Messina will be</p>

<p>very much glad of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  I have already delivered him letters, and</p>

<p>there appears much joy in him, even so much that</p>

<p>joy could not show itself modest enough without a</p>

<p>badge of bitterness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Did he break out into tears?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  In great measure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  A kind overflow of kindness. There are no</p>

<p>faces truer than those that are so washed. How</p>

<p>much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at</p>

<p>weeping!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned</p>

<p>from the wars or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  I know none of that name, lady. There</p>

<p>was none such in the army of any sort.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  What is he that you ask for, niece?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hero</span>  My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  O, he’s returned, and as pleasant as ever</p>

<p>he was.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  He set up his bills here in Messina and</p>

<p>challenged Cupid at the flight, and my uncle’s Fool,</p>

<p>reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid and</p>

<p>challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how</p>

<p>many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But</p>

<p>how many hath he killed? For indeed I promised to</p>

<p>eat all of his killing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too</p>

<p>much, but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  He hath done good service, lady, in these</p>

<p>wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  You had musty victual, and he hath holp to</p>

<p>eat it. He is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an</p>

<p>excellent stomach.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  And a good soldier too, lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  And a good soldier to a lady, but what is he</p>

<p>to a lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed</p>

<p>with all honorable virtues.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  It is so indeed. He is no less than a stuffed</p>

<p>man, but for the stuffing–well, we are all mortal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is</p>

<p>a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and</p>

<p>her. They never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit</p>

<p>between them.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last</p>

<p>conflict, four of his five wits went halting off, and</p>

<p>now is the whole man governed with one, so that if</p>

<p>he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him</p>

<p>bear it for a difference between himself and his</p>

<p>horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left to</p>

<p>be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion</p>

<p>now? He hath every month a new sworn</p>

<p>brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Is ’t possible?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Very easily possible. He wears his faith but</p>

<p>as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the</p>

<p>next block.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your</p>

<p>books.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  No. An he were, I would burn my study. But</p>

<p>I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no</p>

<p>young squarer now that will make a voyage with</p>

<p>him to the devil?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  He is most in the company of the right</p>

<p>noble Claudio.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  O Lord, he will hang upon him like a</p>

<p>disease! He is sooner caught than the pestilence,</p>

<p>and the taker runs presently mad. God help the</p>

<p>noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it</p>

<p>will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  I will hold friends with you, lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Do, good friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  You will never run mad, niece.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  No, not till a hot January.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Don Pedro is approached.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon, with Claudio,</p>

<p>Benedick, Balthasar, and John the Bastard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Good Signior Leonato, are you come to meet</p>

<p>your trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid</p>

<p>cost, and you encounter it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Never came trouble to my house in the</p>

<p>likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone,</p>

<p>comfort should remain, but when you depart from</p>

<p>me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  You embrace your charge too willingly. <i>[Turning</p>

<p>to Hero.]</i> I think this is your daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Her mother hath many times told me so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Signior Benedick, no, for then were you a</p>

<p>child.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by</p>

<p>this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady</p>

<p>fathers herself.–Be happy, lady, for you are like</p>

<p>an honorable father.</p>

<p><center><i>[Leonato and the Prince move aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  If Signior Leonato be her father, she would</p>

<p>not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina,</p>

<p>as like him as she is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior</p>

<p>Benedick, nobody marks you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  What, my dear Lady Disdain! Are you yet</p>

<p>living?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Is it possible disdain should die while she</p>

<p>hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?</p>

<p>Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come</p>

<p>in her presence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain</p>

<p>I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted; and</p>

<p>I would I could find in my heart that I had not a</p>

<p>hard heart, for truly I love none.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  A dear happiness to women. They would</p>

<p>else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I</p>

<p>thank God and my cold blood I am of your humor</p>

<p>for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow</p>

<p>than a man swear he loves me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  God keep your Ladyship still in that mind,</p>

<p>so some gentleman or other shall ’scape a predestinate</p>

<p>scratched face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  Scratching could not make it worse an</p>

<p>’twere such a face as yours were.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of</p>

<p>yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  I would my horse had the speed of your</p>

<p>tongue and so good a continuer, but keep your</p>

<p>way, i’ God’s name, I have done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Beatrice</span>  You always end with a jade’s trick. I know</p>

<p>you of old.</p>

<p><center><i>[Leonato and the Prince come forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  That is the sum of all, Leonato.–Signior</p>

<p>Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend</p>

<p>Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay</p>

<p>here at the least a month, and he heartily prays</p>

<p>some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear</p>

<p>he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  If you swear, my lord, you shall not be</p>

<p>forsworn. <i>[To Don John.]</i> Let me bid you welcome,</p>

<p>my lord, being reconciled to the Prince your brother,</p>

<p>I owe you all duty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Don</span> <span class='sc'>John</span>  I thank you. I am not of many words, but I</p>

<p>thank you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Leonato</span>  Please it your Grace lead on?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Your hand, Leonato. We will go together.</p>

<p><center><i>[All exit except Benedick and Claudio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of</p>

<p>Signior Leonato?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  I noted her not, but I looked on her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Is she not a modest young lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Do you question me as an honest man</p>

<p>should do, for my simple true judgment? Or would</p>

<p>you have me speak after my custom, as being a</p>

<p>professed tyrant to their sex?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  No, I pray thee, speak in sober judgment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Why, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a</p>

<p>high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too</p>

<p>little for a great praise. Only this commendation I</p>

<p>can afford her, that were she other than she is, she</p>

<p>were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is,</p>

<p>I do not like her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell</p>

<p>me truly how thou lik’st her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Would you buy her that you enquire after</p>

<p>her?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  Can the world buy such a jewel?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you</p>

<p>this with a sad brow? Or do you play the flouting</p>

<p>jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and</p>

<p>Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a</p>

<p>man take you to go in the song?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever</p>

<p>I looked on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  I can see yet without spectacles, and I see</p>

<p>no such matter. There’s her cousin, an she were not</p>

<p>possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in</p>

<p>beauty as the first of May doth the last of December.</p>

<p>But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have</p>

<p>you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  I would scarce trust myself, though I had</p>

<p>sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Is ’t come to this? In faith, hath not the</p>

<p>world one man but he will wear his cap with</p>

<p>suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore</p>

<p>again? Go to, i’ faith, an thou wilt needs thrust</p>

<p>thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh</p>

<p>away Sundays. Look, Don Pedro is returned to seek</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  What secret hath held you here that you followed</p>

<p>not to Leonato’s?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  I would your Grace would constrain me to</p>

<p>tell.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  I charge thee on thy allegiance.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  You hear, Count Claudio, I can be secret as</p>

<p>a dumb man, I would have you think so, but on my</p>

<p>allegiance–mark you this, on my allegiance–he</p>

<p>is in love. With who? Now, that is your Grace’s part.</p>

<p>Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato’s</p>

<p>short daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  If this were so, so were it uttered.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Like the old tale, my lord: “It is not so, nor</p>

<p>’twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be</p>

<p>so.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  If my passion change not shortly, God forbid</p>

<p>it should be otherwise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well</p>

<p>worthy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  By my troth, I speak my thought.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I</p>

<p>spoke mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  That I love her, I feel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  That she is worthy, I know.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  That I neither feel how she should be loved</p>

<p>nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion</p>

<p>that fire cannot melt out of me. I will die in it at the</p>

<p>stake.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the</p>

<p>despite of beauty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  And never could maintain his part but in the</p>

<p>force of his will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  That a woman conceived me, I thank her;</p>

<p>that she brought me up, I likewise give her most</p>

<p>humble thanks. But that I will have a recheat</p>

<p>winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an</p>

<p>invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me.</p>

<p>Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust</p>

<p>any, I will do myself the right to trust none. And the</p>

<p>fine is, for the which I may go the finer, I will live a</p>

<p>bachelor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  With anger, with sickness, or with hunger,</p>

<p>my lord, not with love. Prove that ever I lose more</p>

<p>blood with love than I will get again with drinking,</p>

<p>pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and</p>

<p>hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the</p>

<p>sign of blind Cupid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou</p>

<p>wilt prove a notable argument.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and</p>

<p>shoot at me, and he that hits me, let him be clapped</p>

<p>on the shoulder and called Adam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Well, as time shall try.</p>

<p>In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible</p>

<p>Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull’s horns and set</p>

<p>them in my forehead, and let me be vilely painted,</p>

<p>and in such great letters as they write “Here is good</p>

<p>horse to hire” let them signify under my sign “Here</p>

<p>you may see Benedick the married man.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be</p>

<p>horn-mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in</p>

<p>Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  I look for an earthquake too, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the</p>

<p>meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato’s.</p>

<p>Commend me to him, and tell him I will not</p>

<p>fail him at supper, for indeed he hath made great</p>

<p>preparation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  I have almost matter enough in me for such</p>

<p>an embassage, and so I commit you–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  To the tuition of God. From my house, if I had</p>

<p>it–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span>  The sixth of July. Your loving friend,</p>

<p>Benedick.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Benedick</span>  Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your</p>

<p>discourse is sometimes guarded with fragments,</p>

<p>and the guards are but slightly basted on neither.</p>

<p>Ere you flout old ends any further, examine your</p>

<p>conscience. And so I leave you.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>My liege, your Highness now may do me good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>My love is thine to teach. Teach it but how,</p>

<p>And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn</p>

<p>Any hard lesson that may do thee good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>Hath Leonato any son, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>No child but Hero; she’s his only heir.</p>

<p>Dost thou affect her, Claudio?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span>  O, my lord,</p>

<p>When you went onward on this ended action,</p>

<p>I looked upon her with a soldier’s eye,</p>

<p>That liked, but had a rougher task in hand</p>

<p>Than to drive liking to the name of love.</p>

<p>But now I am returned and that war thoughts</p>

<p>Have left their places vacant, in their rooms</p>

<p>Come thronging soft and delicate desires,</p>

<p>All prompting me how fair young Hero is,</p>

<p>Saying I liked her ere I went to wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>Thou wilt be like a lover presently</p>

<p>And tire the hearer with a book of words.</p>

<p>If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,</p>

<p>And I will break with her and with her father,</p>

<p>And thou shalt have her. Was ’t not to this end</p>

<p>That thou began’st to twist so fine a story?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Claudio</span></p>

<p>How sweetly you do minister to love,</p>

<p>That know love’s grief by his complexion!</p>

<p>But lest my liking might too sudden seem,</p>

<p>I would have salved it with a longer treatise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Prince</span></p>

<p>What need the bridge much broader than the flood?</p>

<p>The fairest grant is the necessity.</p>

<p>Look what will serve is fit. ’Tis once, thou lovest,</p>

<p>And I will fit thee with the remedy.</p>

<p>I know we shall have reveling tonight.</p>

<p>I will assume thy part in some disguise</p>

<p>And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,</p>

<p>And in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart</p>

<p>And take her hearing prisoner with the force</p>

<p>And strong encounter of my amorous tale.</p>

<p>Then after to her father will I break,</p>

<p>And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.</p>

<p>In practice let us put it presently.</p>
