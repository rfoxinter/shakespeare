<p><center><i>[Enter Achilles and Patroclus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span></p>

<p>I’ll heat his blood with Greekish wine tonight,</p>

<p>Which with my scimitar I’ll cool tomorrow.</p>

<p>Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patroclus</span></p>

<p>Here comes Thersites.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Thersites.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span>  How now, thou core of envy?</p>

<p>Thou crusty botch of nature, what’s the news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thersites</span>  Why, thou picture of what thou seemest and</p>

<p>idol of idiot-worshippers, here’s a letter for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span>  From whence, fragment?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thersites</span>  Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.</p>

<p><center><i>[Achilles takes the letter and moves aside to read it.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patroclus</span>  Who keeps the tent now?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thersites</span>  The surgeon’s box or the patient’s wound.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patroclus</span>  Well said, adversity. And what need these</p>

<p>tricks?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thersites</span>  Prithee, be silent, boy. I profit not by thy</p>

<p>talk. Thou art said to be Achilles’ male varlet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patroclus</span>  “Male varlet,” you rogue! What’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thersites</span>  Why, his masculine whore. Now the rotten</p>

<p>diseases of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures,</p>

<p>catarrhs, loads o’ gravel in the back, lethargies,</p>

<p>cold palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, whissing</p>

<p>lungs, bladders full of impostume, sciaticas,</p>

<p>limekilns i’ th’ palm, incurable bone-ache, and the</p>

<p>rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take</p>

<p>again such preposterous discoveries.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patroclus</span>  Why, thou damnable box of envy, thou,</p>

<p>what means thou to curse thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thersites</span>  Do I curse thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patroclus</span>  Why, no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson</p>

<p>indistinguishable cur, no.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thersites</span>  No? Why art thou then exasperate, thou idle</p>

<p>immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarsenet</p>

<p>flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal’s purse,</p>

<p>thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered with such</p>

<p>waterflies, diminutives of nature!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patroclus</span>  Out, gall!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thersites</span>  Finch egg!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span> <i>[coming forward]</i></p>

<p>My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite</p>

<p>From my great purpose in tomorrow’s battle.</p>

<p>Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,</p>

<p>A token from her daughter, my fair love,</p>

<p>Both taxing me and gaging me to keep</p>

<p>An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it.</p>

<p>Fall, Greeks; fail, fame; honor, or go or stay;</p>

<p>My major vow lies here; this I’ll obey.</p>

<p>Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent.</p>

<p>This night in banqueting must all be spent.</p>

<p>Away, Patroclus.     <i><i>[He exits with Patroclus.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thersites</span>  With too much blood and too little brain,</p>

<p>these two may run mad; but if with too much brain</p>

<p>and too little blood they do, I’ll be a curer of madmen.</p>

<p>Here’s Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough</p>

<p>and one that loves quails, but he has not so much</p>

<p>brain as earwax. And the goodly transformation</p>

<p>of Jupiter there, his brother, the bull–the primitive</p>

<p>statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds, a</p>

<p>thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his</p>

<p>brother’s leg–to what form but that he is should</p>

<p>wit larded with malice and malice forced with</p>

<p>wit turn him to? To an ass were nothing; he is both</p>

<p>ass and ox. To an ox were nothing; he is both ox</p>

<p>and ass. To be a dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a</p>

<p>toad, a lizard, an owl, a puttock, or a herring without</p>

<p>a roe, I would not care; but to be Menelaus! I</p>

<p>would conspire against destiny. Ask me not what I</p>

<p>would be, if I were not Thersites, for I care not to be</p>

<p>the louse of a lazar so I were not Menelaus.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hector, Troilus, Ajax, Agamemnon, Ulysses,</p>

<p>Nestor, Menelaus, and Diomedes, with lights.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Heyday! Sprites and fires!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span>  We go wrong, we go wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ajax</span></p>

<p>No, yonder–’tis there, where we see the lights.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  I trouble you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ajax</span>  No, not a whit.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Achilles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span> <i>[to Hector]</i>  Here comes himself to guide you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span></p>

<p>Welcome, brave Hector. Welcome, princes all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span> <i>[to Hector]</i></p>

<p>So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.</p>

<p>Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>Thanks, and good night to the Greeks’ general.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menelaus</span></p>

<p>Good night, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  Good night, sweet lord</p>

<p>Menelaus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thersites</span> <i>[aside]</i>  Sweet draught. “Sweet,” quoth he?</p>

<p>Sweet sink, sweet sewer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span></p>

<p>Good night and welcome, both at once, to those</p>

<p>That go or tarry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span>  Good night.</p>

<p><center><i>[Agamemnon and Menelaus exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span></p>

<p>Old Nestor tarries, and you too, Diomed.</p>

<p>Keep Hector company an hour or two.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span></p>

<p>I cannot, lord. I have important business,</p>

<p>The tide whereof is now.–Good night, great Hector.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  Give me your hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span> <i>[aside to Troilus]</i></p>

<p>Follow his torch; he goes to Calchas’ tent.</p>

<p>I’ll keep you company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Sweet sir, you honor me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>And so, good night.</p>

<p><center><i>[Diomedes exits, followed by Troilus and Ulysses.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span>  Come, come, enter my tent.</p>

<p><center><i>[Achilles, Ajax, Nestor, and Hector exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Thersites</span>  That same Diomed’s a false-hearted rogue,</p>

<p>a most unjust knave. I will no more trust him when</p>

<p>he leers than I will a serpent when he hisses. He</p>

<p>will spend his mouth and promise like Brabbler</p>

<p>the hound, but when he performs, astronomers</p>

<p>foretell it; it is prodigious, there will come some</p>

<p>change. The sun borrows of the moon when</p>

<p>Diomed keeps his word. I will rather leave to see</p>

<p>Hector than not to dog him. They say he keeps a</p>

<p>Trojan drab and uses the traitor Calchas his tent.</p>

<p>I’ll after. Nothing but lechery! All incontinent varlets!</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
