<p><center><i>[Enter Priam, Hector, Troilus, Paris and Helenas.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Priam</span></p>

<p>After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,</p>

<p>Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:</p>

<p>“Deliver Helen, and all damage else–</p>

<p>As honor, loss of time, travel, expense,</p>

<p>Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed</p>

<p>In hot digestion of this cormorant war–</p>

<p>Shall be struck off.”–Hector, what say you to ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I</p>

<p>As far as toucheth my particular,</p>

<p>Yet, dread Priam,</p>

<p>There is no lady of more softer bowels,</p>

<p>More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,</p>

<p>More ready to cry out “Who knows what follows?”</p>

<p>Than Hector is. The wound of peace is surety,</p>

<p>Surety secure; but modest doubt is called</p>

<p>The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches</p>

<p>To th’ bottom of the worst. Let Helen go.</p>

<p>Since the first sword was drawn about this question,</p>

<p>Every tithe soul, ’mongst many thousand dismes,</p>

<p>Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours.</p>

<p>If we have lost so many tenths of ours</p>

<p>To guard a thing not ours–nor worth to us,</p>

<p>Had it our name, the value of one ten–</p>

<p>What merit’s in that reason which denies</p>

<p>The yielding of her up?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Fie, fie, my brother,</p>

<p>Weigh you the worth and honor of a king</p>

<p>So great as our dread father’s in a scale</p>

<p>Of common ounces? Will you with counters sum</p>

<p>The past-proportion of his infinite,</p>

<p>And buckle in a waist most fathomless</p>

<p>With spans and inches so diminutive</p>

<p>As fears and reasons? Fie, for godly shame!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helenus</span></p>

<p>No marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons,</p>

<p>You are so empty of them. Should not our father</p>

<p>Bear the great sway of his affairs with reason,</p>

<p>Because your speech hath none that tell him so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest.</p>

<p>You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your</p>

<p>reasons:</p>

<p>You know an enemy intends you harm;</p>

<p>You know a sword employed is perilous,</p>

<p>And reason flies the object of all harm.</p>

<p>Who marvels, then, when Helenus beholds</p>

<p>A Grecian and his sword, if he do set</p>

<p>The very wings of reason to his heels</p>

<p>And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove</p>

<p>Or like a star disorbed? Nay, if we talk of reason,</p>

<p>Let’s shut our gates and sleep. Manhood and honor</p>

<p>Should have hare hearts, would they but fat their</p>

<p>thoughts</p>

<p>With this crammed reason. Reason and respect</p>

<p>Make livers pale and lustihood deject.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost</p>

<p>The keeping.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  What’s aught but as ’tis valued?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>But value dwells not in particular will;</p>

<p>It holds his estimate and dignity</p>

<p>As well wherein ’tis precious of itself</p>

<p>As in the prizer. ’Tis mad idolatry</p>

<p>To make the service greater than the god;</p>

<p>And the will dotes that is attributive</p>

<p>To what infectiously itself affects</p>

<p>Without some image of th’ affected merit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>I take today a wife, and my election</p>

<p>Is led on in the conduct of my will–</p>

<p>My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,</p>

<p>Two traded pilots ’twixt the dangerous shores</p>

<p>Of will and judgment. How may I avoid,</p>

<p>Although my will distaste what it elected,</p>

<p>The wife I choose? There can be no evasion</p>

<p>To blench from this and to stand firm by honor.</p>

<p>We turn not back the silks upon the merchant</p>

<p>When we have soiled them, nor the remainder</p>

<p>viands</p>

<p>We do not throw in unrespective sieve</p>

<p>Because we now are full. It was thought meet</p>

<p>Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks.</p>

<p>Your breath with full consent bellied his sails;</p>

<p>The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce</p>

<p>And did him service. He touched the ports desired,</p>

<p>And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,</p>

<p>He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and</p>

<p>freshness</p>

<p>Wrinkles Apollo’s and makes pale the morning.</p>

<p>Why keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt.</p>

<p>Is she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl</p>

<p>Whose price hath launched above a thousand ships</p>

<p>And turned crowned kings to merchants.</p>

<p>If you’ll avouch ’twas wisdom Paris went–</p>

<p>As you must needs, for you all cried “Go, go”–</p>

<p>If you’ll confess he brought home worthy prize–</p>

<p>As you must needs, for you all clapped your hands</p>

<p>And cried “Inestimable”–why do you now</p>

<p>The issue of your proper wisdoms rate</p>

<p>And do a deed that never Fortune did,</p>

<p>Beggar the estimation which you prized</p>

<p>Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,</p>

<p>That we have stol’n what we do fear to keep!</p>

<p>But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol’n,</p>

<p>That in their country did them that disgrace</p>

<p>We fear to warrant in our native place.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassandra</span> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Cry, Trojans, cry!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Priam</span>  What noise? What shriek is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>’Tis our mad sister. I do know her voice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassandra</span> <i>[within]</i>  Cry, Trojans!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  It is Cassandra.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cassandra raving.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassandra</span></p>

<p>Cry, Trojans, cry! Lend me ten thousand eyes,</p>

<p>And I will fill them with prophetic tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  Peace, sister, peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassandra</span></p>

<p>Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled elders,</p>

<p>Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,</p>

<p>Add to my clamors. Let us pay betimes</p>

<p>A moiety of that mass of moan to come.</p>

<p>Cry, Trojans, cry! Practice your eyes with tears.</p>

<p>Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilium stand.</p>

<p>Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all.</p>

<p>Cry, Trojans, cry! A Helen and a woe!</p>

<p>Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains</p>

<p>Of divination in our sister work</p>

<p>Some touches of remorse? Or is your blood</p>

<p>So madly hot that no discourse of reason</p>

<p>Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause</p>

<p>Can qualify the same?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Why, brother Hector,</p>

<p>We may not think the justness of each act</p>

<p>Such and no other than event doth form it,</p>

<p>Nor once deject the courage of our minds</p>

<p>Because Cassandra’s mad. Her brainsick raptures</p>

<p>Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel</p>

<p>Which hath our several honors all engaged</p>

<p>To make it gracious. For my private part,</p>

<p>I am no more touched than all Priam’s sons;</p>

<p>And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us</p>

<p>Such things as might offend the weakest spleen</p>

<p>To fight for and maintain!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>Else might the world convince of levity</p>

<p>As well my undertakings as your counsels.</p>

<p>But I attest the gods, your full consent</p>

<p>Gave wings to my propension and cut off</p>

<p>All fears attending on so dire a project.</p>

<p>For what, alas, can these my single arms?</p>

<p>What propugnation is in one man’s valor</p>

<p>To stand the push and enmity of those</p>

<p>This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,</p>

<p>Were I alone to pass the difficulties</p>

<p>And had as ample power as I have will,</p>

<p>Paris should ne’er retract what he hath done</p>

<p>Nor faint in the pursuit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Priam</span>  Paris, you speak</p>

<p>Like one besotted on your sweet delights.</p>

<p>You have the honey still, but these the gall.</p>

<p>So to be valiant is no praise at all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>Sir, I propose not merely to myself</p>

<p>The pleasures such a beauty brings with it,</p>

<p>But I would have the soil of her fair rape</p>

<p>Wiped off in honorable keeping her.</p>

<p>What treason were it to the ransacked queen,</p>

<p>Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,</p>

<p>Now to deliver her possession up</p>

<p>On terms of base compulsion? Can it be</p>

<p>That so degenerate a strain as this</p>

<p>Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?</p>

<p>There’s not the meanest spirit on our party</p>

<p>Without a heart to dare or sword to draw</p>

<p>When Helen is defended, nor none so noble</p>

<p>Whose life were ill bestowed or death unfamed</p>

<p>Where Helen is the subject. Then I say,</p>

<p>Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,</p>

<p>The world’s large spaces cannot parallel.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,</p>

<p>And on the cause and question now in hand</p>

<p>Have glozed–but superficially, not much</p>

<p>Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought</p>

<p>Unfit to hear moral philosophy.</p>

<p>The reasons you allege do more conduce</p>

<p>To the hot passion of distempered blood</p>

<p>Than to make up a free determination</p>

<p>’Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge</p>

<p>Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice</p>

<p>Of any true decision. Nature craves</p>

<p>All dues be rendered to their owners. Now,</p>

<p>What nearer debt in all humanity</p>

<p>Than wife is to the husband? If this law</p>

<p>Of nature be corrupted through affection,</p>

<p>And that great minds, of partial indulgence</p>

<p>To their benumbed wills, resist the same,</p>

<p>There is a law in each well-ordered nation</p>

<p>To curb those raging appetites that are</p>

<p>Most disobedient and refractory.</p>

<p>If Helen, then, be wife to Sparta’s king,</p>

<p>As it is known she is, these moral laws</p>

<p>Of nature and of nations speak aloud</p>

<p>To have her back returned. Thus to persist</p>

<p>In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,</p>

<p>But makes it much more heavy. Hector’s opinion</p>

<p>Is this in way of truth; yet, ne’ertheless,</p>

<p>My sprightly brethren, I propend to you</p>

<p>In resolution to keep Helen still,</p>

<p>For ’tis a cause that hath no mean dependence</p>

<p>Upon our joint and several dignities.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Why, there you touched the life of our design!</p>

<p>Were it not glory that we more affected</p>

<p>Than the performance of our heaving spleens,</p>

<p>I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood</p>

<p>Spent more in her defense. But, worthy Hector,</p>

<p>She is a theme of honor and renown,</p>

<p>A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,</p>

<p>Whose present courage may beat down our foes,</p>

<p>And fame in time to come canonize us;</p>

<p>For I presume brave Hector would not lose</p>

<p>So rich advantage of a promised glory</p>

<p>As smiles upon the forehead of this action</p>

<p>For the wide world’s revenue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  I am yours,</p>

<p>You valiant offspring of great Priamus.</p>

<p>I have a roisting challenge sent amongst</p>

<p>The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks</p>

<p>Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits.</p>

<p>I was advertised their great general slept,</p>

<p>Whilst emulation in the army crept.</p>

<p>This, I presume, will wake him.</p>
