<p><center><i>[Enter Pandarus and Cressida, weeping.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Be moderate, be moderate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>Why tell you me of moderation?</p>

<p>The grief is fine, full, perfect that I taste,</p>

<p>And violenteth in a sense as strong</p>

<p>As that which causeth it. How can I moderate it?</p>

<p>If I could temporize with my affection</p>

<p>Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,</p>

<p>The like allayment could I give my grief.</p>

<p>My love admits no qualifying dross;</p>

<p>No more my grief in such a precious loss.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Troilus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Here, here, here he comes. Ah, sweet</p>

<p>ducks!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span> <i>[embracing Troilus]</i>  O Troilus, Troilus!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  What a pair of spectacles is here! Let me</p>

<p>embrace too. “O heart,” as the goodly saying is,</p>

<p>     <i>O heart, heavy heart,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Why sigh’st thou without breaking?</i></p>

<p>where he answers again,</p>

<p>     <i>Because thou canst not ease thy smart</i></p>

<p>     <i>By friendship nor by speaking.</i></p>

<p>There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away</p>

<p>nothing, for we may live to have need of such a</p>

<p>verse. We see it, we see it. How now, lambs?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Cressid, I love thee in so strained a purity</p>

<p>That the blest gods, as angry with my fancy–</p>

<p>More bright in zeal than the devotion which</p>

<p>Cold lips blow to their deities–take thee from me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  Have the gods envy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Ay, ay, ay, ay, ’tis too plain a case.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>And is it true that I must go from Troy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>A hateful truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  What, and from Troilus too?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  From Troy and Troilus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  Is ’t possible?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>And suddenly, where injury of chance</p>

<p>Puts back leave-taking, jostles roughly by</p>

<p>All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips</p>

<p>Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents</p>

<p>Our locked embrasures, strangles our dear vows</p>

<p>Even in the birth of our own laboring breath.</p>

<p>We two, that with so many thousand sighs</p>

<p>Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves</p>

<p>With the rude brevity and discharge of one.</p>

<p>Injurious Time now with a robber’s haste</p>

<p>Crams his rich thiev’ry up, he knows not how.</p>

<p>As many farewells as be stars in heaven,</p>

<p>With distinct breath and consigned kisses to them,</p>

<p>He fumbles up into a loose adieu</p>

<p>And scants us with a single famished kiss,</p>

<p>Distasted with the salt of broken tears.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span> <i>[within]</i>  My lord, is the lady ready?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Hark, you are called. Some say the genius</p>

<p>Cries so to him that instantly must die.–</p>

<p>Bid them have patience. She shall come anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Where are my tears? Rain, to lay this wind,</p>

<p>or my heart will be blown up by the root.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>I must, then, to the Grecians?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  No remedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>A woeful Cressid ’mongst the merry Greeks.</p>

<p>When shall we see again?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Hear me, my love. Be thou but true of heart–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>I true? How now, what wicked deem is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,</p>

<p>For it is parting from us.</p>

<p>I speak not “Be thou true” as fearing thee,</p>

<p>For I will throw my glove to Death himself</p>

<p>That there is no maculation in thy heart;</p>

<p>But “Be thou true,” say I, to fashion in</p>

<p>My sequent protestation: “Be thou true,</p>

<p>And I will see thee.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers</p>

<p>As infinite as imminent! But I’ll be true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>And I’ll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  And you this glove. When shall I see you?</p>

<p><center><i>[They exchange love-tokens.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,</p>

<p>To give thee nightly visitation.</p>

<p>But yet, be true.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  O heavens! “Be true” again?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Hear why I speak it, love.</p>

<p>The Grecian youths are full of quality,</p>

<p>Their loving well composed, with gift of nature</p>

<p>flowing,</p>

<p>And swelling o’er with arts and exercise.</p>

<p>How novelty may move, and parts with person,</p>

<p>Alas, a kind of godly jealousy–</p>

<p>Which I beseech you call a virtuous sin–</p>

<p>Makes me afeard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  O heavens, you love me not!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Die I a villain then!</p>

<p>In this I do not call your faith in question</p>

<p>So mainly as my merit. I cannot sing,</p>

<p>Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,</p>

<p>Nor play at subtle games–fair virtues all,</p>

<p>To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant.</p>

<p>But I can tell that in each grace of these</p>

<p>There lurks a still and dumb-discursive devil</p>

<p>That tempts most cunningly. But be not tempted.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  Do you think I will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  No.</p>

<p>But something may be done that we will not,</p>

<p>And sometimes we are devils to ourselves</p>

<p>When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,</p>

<p>Presuming on their changeful potency.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Nay, good my lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Come, kiss, and let us part.</p>

<p><center><i>[They kiss.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>Brother Troilus!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span> <i>[calling]</i>  Good brother, come you hither,</p>

<p>And bring Aeneas and the Grecian with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  My lord, will you be true?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Who, I? Alas, it is my vice, my fault.</p>

<p>Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,</p>

<p>I with great truth catch mere simplicity.</p>

<p>Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,</p>

<p>With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.</p>

<p>Fear not my truth. The moral of my wit</p>

<p>Is “plain and true”; there’s all the reach of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Aeneas, Paris, Antenor, Deiphobus, and</p>

<p>Diomedes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Welcome, Sir Diomed. Here is the lady</p>

<p>Which for Antenor we deliver you.</p>

<p>At the port, lord, I’ll give her to thy hand</p>

<p>And by the way possess thee what she is.</p>

<p>Entreat her fair and, by my soul, fair Greek,</p>

<p>If e’er thou stand at mercy of my sword,</p>

<p>Name Cressid, and thy life shall be as safe</p>

<p>As Priam is in Ilium.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span>  Fair Lady Cressid,</p>

<p>So please you, save the thanks this prince expects.</p>

<p>The luster in your eye, heaven in your cheek,</p>

<p>Pleads your fair usage, and to Diomed</p>

<p>You shall be mistress and command him wholly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,</p>

<p>To shame the zeal of my petition to thee</p>

<p>In praising her. I tell thee, lord of Greece,</p>

<p>She is as far high-soaring o’er thy praises</p>

<p>As thou unworthy to be called her servant.</p>

<p>I charge thee use her well, even for my charge,</p>

<p>For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,</p>

<p>Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,</p>

<p>I’ll cut thy throat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span>  O, be not moved, Prince Troilus.</p>

<p>Let me be privileged by my place and message</p>

<p>To be a speaker free. When I am hence,</p>

<p>I’ll answer to my lust, and know you, lord,</p>

<p>I’ll nothing do on charge. To her own worth</p>

<p>She shall be prized; but that you say “Be ’t so,”</p>

<p>I speak it in my spirit and honor: “no.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Come, to the port. I’ll tell thee, Diomed,</p>

<p>This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.–</p>

<p>Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,</p>

<p>To our own selves bend we our needful talk.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cressida, Diomedes, and Troilus exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Sound trumpet within.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>Hark, Hector’s trumpet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span>  How have we spent this</p>

<p>morning!</p>

<p>The Prince must think me tardy and remiss</p>

<p>That swore to ride before him to the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>’Tis Troilus’ fault. Come, come to field with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Deiphobus</span>  Let us make ready straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>Yea, with a bridegroom’s fresh alacrity</p>

<p>Let us address to tend on Hector’s heels.</p>

<p>The glory of our Troy doth this day lie</p>

<p>On his fair worth and single chivalry.</p>
