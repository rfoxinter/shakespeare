<p><center><i>[Enter Thersites, alone.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  How now, Thersites? What, lost in the</p>

<p>labyrinth of thy fury? Shall the elephant Ajax carry</p>

<p>it thus? He beats me, and I rail at him. O, worthy</p>

<p>satisfaction! Would it were otherwise, that I could</p>

<p>beat him whilst he railed at me. ’Sfoot, I’ll learn to</p>

<p>conjure and raise devils but I’ll see some issue of</p>

<p>my spiteful execrations. Then there’s Achilles, a</p>

<p>rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine</p>

<p>it, the walls will stand till they fall of</p>

<p>themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,</p>

<p>forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods;</p>

<p>and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy</p>

<p>caduceus, if you take not that little, little, less than</p>

<p>little wit from them that they have, which short-armed</p>

<p>ignorance itself knows is so abundant</p>

<p>scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly</p>

<p>from a spider without drawing their massy irons</p>

<p>and cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on</p>

<p>the whole camp! Or rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache!</p>

<p>For that, methinks, is the curse depending</p>

<p>on those that war for a placket. I have said my</p>

<p>prayers, and devil Envy say “Amen.”–What ho,</p>

<p>my lord Achilles!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Who’s there? Thersites? Good</p>

<p>Thersites, come in and rail.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  If I could ’a remembered a gilt counterfeit,</p>

<p>thou couldst not have slipped out of my contemplation.</p>

<p>But it is no matter. Thyself upon thyself! The</p>

<p>common curse of mankind, folly and ignorance,</p>

<p>be thine in great revenue! Heaven bless thee from</p>

<p>a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy</p>

<p>blood be thy direction till thy death; then if she</p>

<p>that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse, I’ll be</p>

<p>sworn and sworn upon ’t she never shrouded any</p>

<p>but lazars. Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Patroclus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Where’s Achilles?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  What, art thou devout? Wast thou in</p>

<p>prayer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Ay. The heavens hear me!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  Thersites, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Where? Where? O, where?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Achilles.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><i>[To Thersites.]</i> Art thou come? Why, my cheese, my</p>

<p>digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to my</p>

<p>table so many meals? Come, what’s Agamemnon?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Thy commander, Achilles.–Then, tell me,</p>

<p>Patroclus, what’s Achilles?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  Thy lord, Thersites. Then, tell me, I pray</p>

<p>thee, what’s Thersites?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Thy knower, Patroclus. Then, tell me, Patroclus,</p>

<p>what art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  Thou must tell that knowest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  O tell, tell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  I’ll decline the whole question. Agamemnon</p>

<p>commands Achilles, Achilles is my lord, I am</p>

<p>Patroclus’ knower, and Patroclus is a fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  You rascal!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Peace, fool. I have not done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc> <i>[to Patroclus]</i>  He is a privileged man.–Proceed,</p>

<p>Thersites.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Agamemnon is a fool, Achilles is a fool,</p>

<p>Thersites is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a</p>

<p>fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Derive this. Come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command</p>

<p>Achilles, Achilles is a fool to be commanded of</p>

<p>Agamemnon, Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool,</p>

<p>and this Patroclus is a fool positive.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  Why am I a fool?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Make that demand of the creator. It suffices</p>

<p>me thou art.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter at a distance Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor,</p>

<p>Diomedes, Ajax, and Calchas.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look you, who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Patroclus, I’ll speak with nobody.–Come in</p>

<p>with me, Thersites.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Here is such patchery, such juggling, and</p>

<p>such knavery. All the argument is a whore and a</p>

<p>cuckold, a good quarrel to draw emulous factions</p>

<p>and bleed to death upon. Now the dry serpigo on</p>

<p>the subject, and war and lechery confound all!</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc> <i>[to Patroclus]</i>  Where is Achilles?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc></p>

<p>Within his tent, but ill-disposed, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>Let it be known to him that we are here.</p>

<p>He shent our messengers, and we lay by</p>

<p>Our appertainments, visiting of him.</p>

<p>Let him be told so, lest perchance he think</p>

<p>We dare not move the question of our place</p>

<p>Or know not what we are.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  I shall say so to him.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>We saw him at the opening of his tent.</p>

<p>He is not sick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call</p>

<p>it melancholy if you will favor the man, but, by my</p>

<p>head, ’tis pride. But, why, why? Let him show us a</p>

<p>cause.–A word, my lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[He and Agamemnon walk aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc>  What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc>  Who, Thersites?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  He.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc>  Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his</p>

<p>argument.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  No. You see, he is his argument that has his</p>

<p>argument: Achilles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc>  All the better. Their fraction is more our wish</p>

<p>than their faction. But it was a strong composure a</p>

<p>fool could disunite.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may</p>

<p>easily untie.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Patroclus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes Patroclus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc>  No Achilles with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy;</p>

<p>his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc> <i>[to Agamemnon]</i></p>

<p>Achilles bids me say he is much sorry</p>

<p>If anything more than your sport and pleasure</p>

<p>Did move your greatness and this noble state</p>

<p>To call upon him. He hopes it is no other</p>

<p>But for your health and your digestion sake,</p>

<p>An after-dinner’s breath.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  Hear you, Patroclus:</p>

<p>We are too well acquainted with these answers,</p>

<p>But his evasion, winged thus swift with scorn,</p>

<p>Cannot outfly our apprehensions.</p>

<p>Much attribute he hath, and much the reason</p>

<p>Why we ascribe it to him. Yet all his virtues,</p>

<p>Not virtuously on his own part beheld,</p>

<p>Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,</p>

<p>Yea, and like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,</p>

<p>Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him</p>

<p>We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin</p>

<p>If you do say we think him overproud</p>

<p>And underhonest, in self-assumption greater</p>

<p>Than in the note of judgment; and worthier than</p>

<p>himself</p>

<p>Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,</p>

<p>Disguise the holy strength of their command,</p>

<p>And underwrite in an observing kind</p>

<p>His humorous predominance–yea, watch</p>

<p>His course and time, his ebbs and flows, as if</p>

<p>The passage and whole carriage of this action</p>

<p>Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add</p>

<p>That, if he overhold his price so much,</p>

<p>We’ll none of him. But let him, like an engine</p>

<p>Not portable, lie under this report:</p>

<p>“Bring action hither; this cannot go to war.”</p>

<p>A stirring dwarf we do allowance give</p>

<p>Before a sleeping giant. Tell him so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc></p>

<p>I shall, and bring his answer presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>In second voice we’ll not be satisfied;</p>

<p>We come to speak with him.–Ulysses, enter you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Ulysses exits, with Patroclus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  What is he more than another?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  No more than what he thinks he is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself</p>

<p>a better man than I am?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  No question.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Will you subscribe his thought and say he is?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  No, noble Ajax. You are as strong, as</p>

<p>valiant, as wise, no less noble, much more gentle,</p>

<p>and altogether more tractable.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Why should a man be proud? How doth pride</p>

<p>grow? I know not what pride is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your</p>

<p>virtues the fairer. He that is proud eats up himself.</p>

<p>Pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own</p>

<p>chronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the</p>

<p>deed devours the deed in the praise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  I do hate a proud man as I hate the engendering</p>

<p>of toads.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>And yet he loves himself. Is ’t not strange?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ulysses.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>Achilles will not to the field tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>What’s his excuse?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  He doth rely on none,</p>

<p>But carries on the stream of his dispose,</p>

<p>Without observance or respect of any,</p>

<p>In will peculiar and in self-admission.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>Why, will he not, upon our fair request,</p>

<p>Untent his person and share th’ air with us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>Things small as nothing, for request’s sake only,</p>

<p>He makes important. Possessed he is with greatness</p>

<p>And speaks not to himself but with a pride</p>

<p>That quarrels at self-breath. Imagined worth</p>

<p>Holds in his blood such swoll’n and hot discourse</p>

<p>That ’twixt his mental and his active parts</p>

<p>Kingdomed Achilles in commotion rages</p>

<p>And batters down himself. What should I say?</p>

<p>He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it</p>

<p>Cry “No recovery.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  Let Ajax go to him.–</p>

<p>Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent.</p>

<p>’Tis said he holds you well and will be led</p>

<p>At your request a little from himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>O Agamemnon, let it not be so!</p>

<p>We’ll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes</p>

<p>When they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord</p>

<p>That bastes his arrogance with his own seam</p>

<p>And never suffers matter of the world</p>

<p>Enter his thoughts, save such as doth revolve</p>

<p>And ruminate himself–shall he be worshipped</p>

<p>Of that we hold an idol more than he?</p>

<p>No. This thrice-worthy and right valiant lord</p>

<p>Shall not so stale his palm, nobly acquired,</p>

<p>Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,</p>

<p>As amply titled as Achilles is,</p>

<p>By going to Achilles.</p>

<p>That were to enlard his fat-already pride</p>

<p>And add more coals to Cancer when he burns</p>

<p>With entertaining great Hyperion.</p>

<p>This lord go to him? Jupiter forbid</p>

<p>And say in thunder “Achilles, go to him.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc> <i>[aside to Diomedes]</i></p>

<p>O, this is well; he rubs the vein of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diomedes</sc> <i>[aside to Nestor]</i></p>

<p>And how his silence drinks up this applause!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc></p>

<p>If I go to him, with my armed fist</p>

<p>I’ll pash him o’er the face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  O, no, you shall not go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc></p>

<p>An he be proud with me, I’ll feeze his pride.</p>

<p>Let me go to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  A paltry, insolent fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  How he describes himself!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Can he not be sociable?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  The raven chides blackness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  I’ll let his humorous blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He will be the physician that</p>

<p>should be the patient.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  An all men were of my mind–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Wit would be out of fashion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  –he should not bear it so; he should eat swords</p>

<p>first. Shall pride carry it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  An ’twould, you’d carry half.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He would have ten shares.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  I will knead him; I’ll make him supple.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He’s not yet through warm. Force him</p>

<p>with praises. Pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc> <i>[to Agamemnon]</i></p>

<p>My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc> <i>[to Agamemnon]</i></p>

<p>Our noble general, do not do so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diomedes</sc> <i>[to Agamemnon]</i></p>

<p>You must prepare to fight without Achilles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>Why, ’tis this naming of him does him harm.</p>

<p>Here is a man–but ’tis before his face;</p>

<p>I will be silent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc>  Wherefore should you so?</p>

<p>He is not emulous, as Achilles is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>Know the whole world, he is as valiant–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  A whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus!</p>

<p>Would he were a Trojan!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc>  What a vice were it in Ajax now–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  If he were proud–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diomedes</sc>  Or covetous of praise–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  Ay, or surly borne–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diomedes</sc>  Or strange, or self-affected–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc> <i>[to Ajax]</i></p>

<p>Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet</p>

<p>composure.</p>

<p>Praise him that gat thee, she that gave thee suck;</p>

<p>Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature</p>

<p>Thrice famed beyond, beyond thy erudition;</p>

<p>But he that disciplined thine arms to fight,</p>

<p>Let Mars divide eternity in twain</p>

<p>And give him half; and for thy vigor,</p>

<p>Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield</p>

<p>To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,</p>

<p>Which like a bourn, a pale, a shore confines</p>

<p>Thy spacious and dilated parts. Here’s Nestor,</p>

<p>Instructed by the antiquary times;</p>

<p>He must, he is, he cannot but be wise.–</p>

<p>But pardon, father Nestor, were your days</p>

<p>As green as Ajax’ and your brain so tempered,</p>

<p>You should not have the eminence of him,</p>

<p>But be as Ajax.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Shall I call you father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc></p>

<p>Ay, my good son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diomedes</sc>  Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles</p>

<p>Keeps thicket. Please it our great general</p>

<p>To call together all his state of war.</p>

<p>Fresh kings are come to Troy. Tomorrow</p>

<p>We must with all our main of power stand fast.</p>

<p>And here’s a lord–come knights from east to west</p>

<p>And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep.</p>

<p>Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.</p>
