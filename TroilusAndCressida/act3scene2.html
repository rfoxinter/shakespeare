<p><center><i>[Enter Pandarus and Troilus’s Man, meeting.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  How now? Where’s thy master? At my</p>

<p>cousin Cressida’s?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Man</sc>  No, sir, he stays for you to conduct him thither.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Troilus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  O, here he comes.–How now, how now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc> <i>[to his Man]</i>  Sirrah, walk off.     <i><i>[Man exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Have you seen my cousin?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>No, Pandarus. I stalk about her door</p>

<p>Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks</p>

<p>Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,</p>

<p>And give me swift transportance to those fields</p>

<p>Where I may wallow in the lily beds</p>

<p>Proposed for the deserver! O, gentle Pandar,</p>

<p>From Cupid’s shoulder pluck his painted wings</p>

<p>And fly with me to Cressid!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Walk here i’ th’ orchard. I’ll bring her</p>

<p>straight.</p>

<p><center><i>[Pandarus exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.</p>

<p>Th’ imaginary relish is so sweet</p>

<p>That it enchants my sense. What will it be</p>

<p>When that the wat’ry palate taste indeed</p>

<p>Love’s thrice-repured nectar? Death, I fear me,</p>

<p>Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,</p>

<p>Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness</p>

<p>For the capacity of my ruder powers.</p>

<p>I fear it much; and I do fear besides</p>

<p>That I shall lose distinction in my joys,</p>

<p>As doth a battle when they charge on heaps</p>

<p>The enemy flying.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pandarus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  She’s making her ready; she’ll come straight.</p>

<p>You must be witty now. She does so blush and</p>

<p>fetches her wind so short as if she were frayed with</p>

<p>a spirit. I’ll fetch her. It is the prettiest villain. She</p>

<p>fetches her breath as short as a new-ta’en sparrow.</p>

<p><center><i>[Pandarus exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom.</p>

<p>My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse,</p>

<p>And all my powers do their bestowing lose,</p>

<p>Like vassalage at unawares encount’ring</p>

<p>The eye of majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pandarus, and Cressida veiled.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc> <i>[to Cressida]</i>  Come, come, what need you</p>

<p>blush? Shame’s a baby.–Here she is now. Swear</p>

<p>the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.</p>

<p><i>[Cressida offers to leave.]</i> What, are you gone again?</p>

<p>You must be watched ere you be made tame, must</p>

<p>you? Come your ways; come your ways. An you</p>

<p>draw backward, we’ll put you i’ th’ thills.–Why</p>

<p>do you not speak to her?–Come, draw this curtain</p>

<p>and let’s see your picture. <i>[He draws back her veil.]</i></p>

<p>Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight!</p>

<p>An ’twere dark, you’d close sooner.–So, so, rub on,</p>

<p>and kiss the mistress. <i>[(They kiss.)]</i> How now? A</p>

<p>kiss in fee-farm? Build there, carpenter; the air is</p>

<p>sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I</p>

<p>part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the ducks</p>

<p>i’ th’ river. Go to, go to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  You have bereft me of all words, lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Words pay no debts; give her deeds. But</p>

<p>she’ll bereave you o’ th’ deeds too, if she call your</p>

<p>activity in question. <i>[(They kiss.)]</i> What, billing</p>

<p>again? Here’s “In witness whereof the parties</p>

<p>interchangeably–.” Come in, come in. I’ll go get a fire.</p>

<p><center><i>[Pandarus exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Will you walk in, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  O Cressid, how often have I wished me thus!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  “Wished,” my lord? The gods grant–O, my</p>

<p>lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  What should they grant? What makes this</p>

<p>pretty abruption? What too-curious dreg espies</p>

<p>my sweet lady in the fountain of our love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  Fears make devils of cherubins; they never</p>

<p>see truly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds</p>

<p>safer footing than blind reason, stumbling without</p>

<p>fear. To fear the worst oft cures the worse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  O, let my lady apprehend no fear. In all</p>

<p>Cupid’s pageant there is presented no monster.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Nor nothing monstrous neither?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  Nothing but our undertakings, when we vow</p>

<p>to weep seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers,</p>

<p>thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition</p>

<p>enough than for us to undergo any difficulty</p>

<p>imposed. This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that</p>

<p>the will is infinite and the execution confined, that</p>

<p>the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  They say all lovers swear more performance</p>

<p>than they are able and yet reserve an ability that</p>

<p>they never perform, vowing more than the perfection</p>

<p>of ten and discharging less than the tenth part</p>

<p>of one. They that have the voice of lions and the</p>

<p>act of hares, are they not monsters?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  Are there such? Such are not we. Praise us as</p>

<p>we are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall</p>

<p>go bare till merit crown it. No perfection in reversion</p>

<p>shall have a praise in present. We will not</p>

<p>name desert before his birth, and, being born, his</p>

<p>addition shall be humble. Few words to fair faith.</p>

<p>Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can</p>

<p>say worst shall be a mock for his truth, and what</p>

<p>truth can speak truest not truer than Troilus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Will you walk in, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pandarus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  What, blushing still? Have you not done</p>

<p>talking yet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Well, uncle, what folly I commit I dedicate</p>

<p>to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  I thank you for that. If my lord get a boy of</p>

<p>you, you’ll give him me. Be true to my lord. If he</p>

<p>flinch, chide me for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc> <i>[to Cressida]</i>  You know now your hostages:</p>

<p>your uncle’s word and my firm faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Nay, I’ll give my word for her too. Our kindred,</p>

<p>though they be long ere they be wooed, they</p>

<p>are constant being won. They are burrs, I can tell</p>

<p>you; they’ll stick where they are thrown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc></p>

<p>Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart.</p>

<p>Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day</p>

<p>For many weary months.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc></p>

<p>Hard to seem won; but I was won, my lord,</p>

<p>With the first glance that ever–pardon me;</p>

<p>If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.</p>

<p>I love you now, but till now not so much</p>

<p>But I might master it. In faith, I lie;</p>

<p>My thoughts were like unbridled children grown</p>

<p>Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!</p>

<p>Why have I blabbed? Who shall be true to us</p>

<p>When we are so unsecret to ourselves?</p>

<p>But though I loved you well, I wooed you not;</p>

<p>And yet, good faith, I wished myself a man;</p>

<p>Or that we women had men’s privilege</p>

<p>Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,</p>

<p>For in this rapture I shall surely speak</p>

<p>The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,</p>

<p>Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws</p>

<p>My very soul of counsel! Stop my mouth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.</p>

<p><center><i>[They kiss.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Pretty, i’ faith!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc> <i>[to Troilus]</i></p>

<p>My lord, I do beseech you pardon me.</p>

<p>’Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.</p>

<p>I am ashamed. O heavens, what have I done!</p>

<p>For this time will I take my leave, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  Your leave, sweet Cressid?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Leave? An you take leave till tomorrow</p>

<p>morning–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Pray you, content you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  What offends you, lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Sir, mine own company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  You cannot shun yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Let me go and try.</p>

<p>I have a kind of self resides with you,</p>

<p>But an unkind self that itself will leave</p>

<p>To be another’s fool. I would be gone.</p>

<p>Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc></p>

<p>Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love</p>

<p>And fell so roundly to a large confession</p>

<p>To angle for your thoughts. But you are wise,</p>

<p>Or else you love not; for to be wise and love</p>

<p>Exceeds man’s might. That dwells with gods above.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>O, that I thought it could be in a woman–</p>

<p>As, if it can, I will presume in you–</p>

<p>To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love,</p>

<p>To keep her constancy in plight and youth,</p>

<p>Outliving beauty’s outward, with a mind</p>

<p>That doth renew swifter than blood decays!</p>

<p>Or that persuasion could but thus convince me</p>

<p>That my integrity and truth to you</p>

<p>Might be affronted with the match and weight</p>

<p>Of such a winnowed purity in love;</p>

<p>How were I then uplifted! But, alas,</p>

<p>I am as true as truth’s simplicity</p>

<p>And simpler than the infancy of truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc></p>

<p>In that I’ll war with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  O virtuous fight,</p>

<p>When right with right wars who shall be most right!</p>

<p>True swains in love shall in the world to come</p>

<p>Approve their truth by Troilus. When their rhymes,</p>

<p>Full of protest, of oath and big compare,</p>

<p>Wants similes, truth tired with iteration–</p>

<p>“As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,</p>

<p>As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,</p>

<p>As iron to adamant, as Earth to th’ center”–</p>

<p>Yet, after all comparisons of truth,</p>

<p>As truth’s authentic author to be cited,</p>

<p>“As true as Troilus” shall crown up the verse</p>

<p>And sanctify the numbers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Prophet may you be!</p>

<p>If I be false or swerve a hair from truth,</p>

<p>When time is old and hath forgot itself,</p>

<p>When water drops have worn the stones of Troy</p>

<p>And blind oblivion swallowed cities up,</p>

<p>And mighty states characterless are grated</p>

<p>To dusty nothing, yet let memory,</p>

<p>From false to false, among false maids in love,</p>

<p>Upbraid my falsehood! When they’ve said “as false</p>

<p>As air, as water, wind or sandy earth,</p>

<p>As fox to lamb, or wolf to heifer’s calf,</p>

<p>Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,”</p>

<p>Yea, let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,</p>

<p>“As false as Cressid.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Go to, a bargain made. Seal it, seal it. I’ll be</p>

<p>the witness. Here I hold your hand, here my</p>

<p>cousin’s. If ever you prove false one to another, since</p>

<p>I have taken such pains to bring you together, let</p>

<p>all pitiful goers-between be called to the world’s</p>

<p>end after my name: call them all panders. Let all</p>

<p>constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,</p>

<p>and all brokers-between panders. Say “Amen.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber</p>

<p>with a bed, which bed, because it shall not</p>

<p>speak of your pretty encounters, press it to death.</p>

<p>Away.     <i><i>[Troilus and Cressida exit.]</i></i></p>

<p>And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here</p>

<p>Bed, chamber, pander to provide this gear.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
