<p><center><i>[Enter at one door Aeneas with a Torchbearer, at</p>

<p>another Paris, Deiphobus, Antenor, Diomedes and</p>

<p>Grecians with torches.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span>  See, ho! Who is that there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Deiphobus</span>  It is the Lord Aeneas.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span>  Is the Prince there in person?–</p>

<p>Had I so good occasion to lie long</p>

<p>As you, Prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business</p>

<p>Should rob my bedmate of my company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span></p>

<p>That’s my mind too.–Good morrow, Lord Aeneas.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>A valiant Greek, Aeneas; take his hand.</p>

<p>Witness the process of your speech, wherein</p>

<p>You told how Diomed a whole week by days</p>

<p>Did haunt you in the field.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span>  Health to you, valiant sir,</p>

<p>During all question of the gentle truce;</p>

<p>But when I meet you armed, as black defiance</p>

<p>As heart can think or courage execute.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span></p>

<p>The one and other Diomed embraces.</p>

<p>Our bloods are now in calm, and, so long, health;</p>

<p>But when contention and occasion meet,</p>

<p>By Jove, I’ll play the hunter for thy life</p>

<p>With all my force, pursuit, and policy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>And thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly</p>

<p>With his face backward. In human gentleness,</p>

<p>Welcome to Troy. Now, by Anchises’ life,</p>

<p>Welcome indeed. By Venus’ hand I swear</p>

<p>No man alive can love in such a sort</p>

<p>The thing he means to kill more excellently.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span></p>

<p>We sympathize. Jove, let Aeneas live,</p>

<p>If to my sword his fate be not the glory,</p>

<p>A thousand complete courses of the sun!</p>

<p>But in mine emulous honor let him die</p>

<p>With every joint a wound and that tomorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span>  We know each other well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span></p>

<p>We do, and long to know each other worse.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,</p>

<p>The noblest hateful love, that e’er I heard of.</p>

<p><i>[To Aeneas.]</i> What business, lord, so early?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>I was sent for to the King, but why I know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>His purpose meets you. ’Twas to bring this Greek</p>

<p>To Calchas’ house, and there to render him,</p>

<p>For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid.</p>

<p>Let’s have your company, or, if you please,</p>

<p>Haste there before us. <i>[(Aside to Aeneas.)]</i> I constantly</p>

<p>believe–</p>

<p>Or, rather, call my thought a certain knowledge–</p>

<p>My brother Troilus lodges there tonight.</p>

<p>Rouse him, and give him note of our approach,</p>

<p>With the whole quality whereof. I fear</p>

<p>We shall be much unwelcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span> <i>[aside to Paris]</i>  That I assure you.</p>

<p>Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece</p>

<p>Than Cressid borne from Troy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span> <i>[aside to Aeneas]</i>  There is no help.</p>

<p>The bitter disposition of the time</p>

<p>Will have it so.–On, lord, we’ll follow you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span>  Good morrow, all.</p>

<p><center><i>[Aeneas exits with the Torchbearer.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,</p>

<p>Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,</p>

<p>Who, in your thoughts, deserves fair Helen best,</p>

<p>Myself or Menelaus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span>  Both alike.</p>

<p>He merits well to have her that doth seek her,</p>

<p>Not making any scruple of her soilure,</p>

<p>With such a hell of pain and world of charge;</p>

<p>And you as well to keep her that defend her,</p>

<p>Not palating the taste of her dishonor,</p>

<p>With such a costly loss of wealth and friends.</p>

<p>He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up</p>

<p>The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;</p>

<p>You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins</p>

<p>Are pleased to breed out your inheritors.</p>

<p>Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;</p>

<p>But he as he, the heavier for a whore.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>You are too bitter to your countrywoman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span></p>

<p>She’s bitter to her country. Hear me, Paris:</p>

<p>For every false drop in her bawdy veins</p>

<p>A Grecian’s life hath sunk; for every scruple</p>

<p>Of her contaminated carrion weight</p>

<p>A Trojan hath been slain. Since she could speak,</p>

<p>She hath not given so many good words breath</p>

<p>As for her Greeks and Trojans suffered death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Paris</span></p>

<p>Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,</p>

<p>Dispraise the thing that they desire to buy.</p>

<p>But we in silence hold this virtue well:</p>

<p>We’ll not commend that not intend to sell.</p>

<p>Here lies our way.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
