<p><center><i>[Enter Pandarus and Troilus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Call here my varlet; I’ll unarm again.</p>

<p>Why should I war without the walls of Troy</p>

<p>That find such cruel battle here within?</p>

<p>Each Trojan that is master of his heart,</p>

<p>Let him to field; Troilus, alas, hath none.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Will this gear ne’er be mended?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,</p>

<p>Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;</p>

<p>But I am weaker than a woman’s tear,</p>

<p>Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,</p>

<p>Less valiant than the virgin in the night,</p>

<p>And skilless as unpracticed infancy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Well, I have told you enough of this. For my</p>

<p>part, I’ll not meddle nor make no farther. He that will</p>

<p>have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Have I not tarried?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the</p>

<p>bolting.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Have I not tarried?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the</p>

<p>leavening.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Still have I tarried.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Ay, to the leavening; but here’s yet in the word</p>

<p>hereafter the kneading, the making of the cake, the</p>

<p>heating the oven, and the baking. Nay, you must stay</p>

<p>the cooling too, or you may chance burn your lips.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Patience herself, what goddess e’er she be,</p>

<p>Doth lesser blench at suff’rance than I do.</p>

<p>At Priam’s royal table do I sit</p>

<p>And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts–</p>

<p>So, traitor! “When she comes”? When is she</p>

<p>thence?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever</p>

<p>I saw her look, or any woman else.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>I was about to tell thee: when my heart,</p>

<p>As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,</p>

<p>Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,</p>

<p>I have, as when the sun doth light a-scorn,</p>

<p>Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile;</p>

<p>But sorrow that is couched in seeming gladness</p>

<p>Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  An her hair were not somewhat darker than</p>

<p>Helen’s–well, go to–there were no more comparison</p>

<p>between the women. But, for my part, she is</p>

<p>my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise</p>

<p>her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday,</p>

<p>as I did. I will not dispraise your sister Cassandra’s</p>

<p>wit, but–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>O, Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus:</p>

<p>When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drowned,</p>

<p>Reply not in how many fathoms deep</p>

<p>They lie indrenched. I tell thee I am mad</p>

<p>In Cressid’s love. Thou answer’st she is fair;</p>

<p>Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart</p>

<p>Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice;</p>

<p>Handiest in thy discourse–O–that her hand,</p>

<p>In whose comparison all whites are ink</p>

<p>Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure</p>

<p>The cygnet’s down is harsh, and spirit of sense</p>

<p>Hard as the palm of plowman. This thou tell’st me,</p>

<p>As true thou tell’st me, when I say I love her.</p>

<p>But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm</p>

<p>Thou lay’st in every gash that love hath given me</p>

<p>The knife that made it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  I speak no more than truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Thou dost not speak so much.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Faith, I’ll not meddle in it. Let her be as she</p>

<p>is. If she be fair, ’tis the better for her; an she be</p>

<p>not, she has the mends in her own hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Good Pandarus–how now, Pandarus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  I have had my labor for my travail, ill thought</p>

<p>on of her, and ill thought on of you; gone between</p>

<p>and between, but small thanks for my labor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with</p>

<p>me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Because she’s kin to me, therefore she’s not</p>

<p>so fair as Helen; an she were not kin to me, she</p>

<p>would be as fair o’ Friday as Helen is on Sunday.</p>

<p>But what care I? I care not an she were a blackamoor;</p>

<p>’tis all one to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Say I she is not fair?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  I do not care whether you do or no. She’s a</p>

<p>fool to stay behind her father. Let her to the Greeks,</p>

<p>and so I’ll tell her the next time I see her. For my</p>

<p>part, I’ll meddle nor make no more i’ th’ matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Pandarus–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Not I.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Sweet Pandarus–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Pray you speak no more to me. I will leave</p>

<p>all as I found it, and there an end.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Sound alarum.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Peace, you ungracious clamors! Peace, rude sounds!</p>

<p>Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair</p>

<p>When with your blood you daily paint her thus.</p>

<p>I cannot fight upon this argument;</p>

<p>It is too starved a subject for my sword.</p>

<p>But Pandarus–O gods, how do you plague me!</p>

<p>I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar,</p>

<p>And he’s as tetchy to be wooed to woo</p>

<p>As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.</p>

<p>Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphnes love,</p>

<p>What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we.</p>

<p>Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl.</p>

<p>Between our Ilium and where she resides,</p>

<p>Let it be called the wild and wand’ring flood,</p>

<p>Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar</p>

<p>Our doubtful hope, our convoy, and our bark.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Alarum. Enter Aeneas.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>How now, Prince Troilus? Wherefore not afield?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Because not there. This woman’s answer sorts,</p>

<p>For womanish it is to be from thence.</p>

<p>What news, Aeneas, from the field today?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>That Paris is returned home, and hurt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>By whom, Aeneas?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span>  Troilus, by Menelaus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Let Paris bleed. ’Tis but a scar to scorn;</p>

<p>Paris is gored with Menelaus’ horn.</p>

<p><center><i>[Alarum.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>Hark what good sport is out of town today!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Better at home, if “would I might” were “may.”</p>

<p>But to the sport abroad. Are you bound thither?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>In all swift haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Come, go we then together.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
