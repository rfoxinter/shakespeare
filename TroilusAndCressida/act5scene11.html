<p><center><i>[Enter Aeneas, Paris, Antenor, Deiphobus, and Trojan</p>

<p>soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aeneas</sc></p>

<p>Stand, ho! Yet are we masters of the field.</p>

<p>Never go home; here starve we out the night.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Troilus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>Hector is slain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Hector! The gods forbid!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>He’s dead, and at the murderer’s horse’s tail,</p>

<p>In beastly sort, dragged through the shameful field.</p>

<p>Frown on, you heavens; effect your rage with speed.</p>

<p>Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smite at Troy!</p>

<p>I say at once: let your brief plagues be mercy,</p>

<p>And linger not our sure destructions on!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aeneas</sc></p>

<p>My lord, you do discomfort all the host.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>You understand me not that tell me so.</p>

<p>I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,</p>

<p>But dare all imminence that gods and men</p>

<p>Address their dangers in. Hector is gone.</p>

<p>Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?</p>

<p>Let him that will a screech-owl aye be called</p>

<p>Go into Troy and say their Hector’s dead.</p>

<p>There is a word will Priam turn to stone,</p>

<p>Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,</p>

<p>Cold statues of the youth and, in a word,</p>

<p>Scare Troy out of itself. But march away.</p>

<p>Hector is dead. There is no more to say.</p>

<p>Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,</p>

<p>Thus proudly pitched upon our Phrygian plains,</p>

<p>Let Titan rise as early as he dare,</p>

<p>I’ll through and through you! And, thou great-sized</p>

<p>coward,</p>

<p>No space of earth shall sunder our two hates.</p>

<p>I’ll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,</p>

<p>That moldeth goblins swift as frenzy’s thoughts.</p>

<p>Strike a free march to Troy! With comfort go.</p>

<p>Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pandarus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  But hear you, hear you!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>Hence, broker, lackey! Ignomy and shame</p>

<p>Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Pandarus exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O</p>

<p>world, world, world! Thus is the poor agent despised.</p>

<p>O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are</p>

<p>you set a-work, and how ill requited! Why should</p>

<p>our endeavor be so loved and the performance so</p>

<p>loathed? What verse for it? What instance for it?</p>

<p>Let me see:</p>

<p>     <i>Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;</i></p>

<p>     <i>And being once subdued in armed tail,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.</i></p>

<p>Good traders in the flesh, set this in your painted</p>

<p>cloths:</p>

<p>As many as be here of panders’ hall,</p>

<p>Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar’s fall;</p>

<p>Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,</p>

<p>Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.</p>

<p>Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,</p>

<p>Some two months hence my will shall here be made.</p>

<p>It should be now, but that my fear is this:</p>

<p>Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss.</p>

<p>Till then I’ll sweat and seek about for eases,</p>

<p>And at that time bequeath you my diseases.</p>
