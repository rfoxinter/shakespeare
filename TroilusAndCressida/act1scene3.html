<p><center><i>[Sennet. Enter Agamemnon, Nestor, Ulysses, Diomedes,</p>

<p>Menelaus, with others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>Princes, what grief hath set the jaundice o’er your</p>

<p>cheeks?</p>

<p>The ample proposition that hope makes</p>

<p>In all designs begun on Earth below</p>

<p>Fails in the promised largeness. Checks and disasters</p>

<p>Grow in the veins of actions highest reared,</p>

<p>As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,</p>

<p>Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain</p>

<p>Tortive and errant from his course of growth.</p>

<p>Nor, princes, is it matter new to us</p>

<p>That we come short of our suppose so far</p>

<p>That after seven years’ siege yet Troy walls stand,</p>

<p>Sith every action that hath gone before,</p>

<p>Whereof we have record, trial did draw</p>

<p>Bias and thwart, not answering the aim</p>

<p>And that unbodied figure of the thought</p>

<p>That gave ’t surmised shape. Why then, you princes,</p>

<p>Do you with cheeks abashed behold our works</p>

<p>And call them shames, which are indeed naught else</p>

<p>But the protractive trials of great Jove</p>

<p>To find persistive constancy in men?</p>

<p>The fineness of which metal is not found</p>

<p>In Fortune’s love; for then the bold and coward,</p>

<p>The wise and fool, the artist and unread,</p>

<p>The hard and soft seem all affined and kin.</p>

<p>But in the wind and tempest of her frown,</p>

<p>Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,</p>

<p>Puffing at all, winnows the light away,</p>

<p>And what hath mass or matter by itself</p>

<p>Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc></p>

<p>With due observance of thy godlike seat,</p>

<p>Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply</p>

<p>Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance</p>

<p>Lies the true proof of men. The sea being smooth,</p>

<p>How many shallow bauble boats dare sail</p>

<p>Upon her patient breast, making their way</p>

<p>With those of nobler bulk!</p>

<p>But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage</p>

<p>The gentle Thetis, and anon behold</p>

<p>The strong-ribbed bark through liquid mountains cut,</p>

<p>Bounding between the two moist elements,</p>

<p>Like Perseus’ horse. Where’s then the saucy boat</p>

<p>Whose weak untimbered sides but even now</p>

<p>Corrivaled greatness? Either to harbor fled</p>

<p>Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so</p>

<p>Doth valor’s show and valor’s worth divide</p>

<p>In storms of Fortune. For in her ray and brightness</p>

<p>The herd hath more annoyance by the breese</p>

<p>Than by the tiger, but when the splitting wind</p>

<p>Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,</p>

<p>And flies flee under shade, why, then the thing of</p>

<p>courage,</p>

<p>As roused with rage, with rage doth sympathize,</p>

<p>And with an accent tuned in selfsame key</p>

<p>Retorts to chiding Fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  Agamemnon,</p>

<p>Thou great commander, nerves and bone of Greece,</p>

<p>Heart of our numbers, soul and only sprite,</p>

<p>In whom the tempers and the minds of all</p>

<p>Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.</p>

<p>Besides th’ applause and approbation,</p>

<p>The which, <i>[(to Agamemnon)]</i> most mighty for thy</p>

<p>place and sway,</p>

<p><i>[(To Nestor)]</i> And thou most reverend for thy</p>

<p>stretched-out life,</p>

<p>I give to both your speeches, which were such</p>

<p>As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece</p>

<p>Should hold up high in brass; and such again</p>

<p>As venerable Nestor, hatched in silver,</p>

<p>Should with a bond of air, strong as the axletree</p>

<p>On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears</p>

<p>To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,</p>

<p>Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>Speak, Prince of Ithaca, and be ’t of less expect</p>

<p>That matter needless, of importless burden,</p>

<p>Divide thy lips than we are confident</p>

<p>When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws</p>

<p>We shall hear music, wit, and oracle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,</p>

<p>And the great Hector’s sword had lacked a master</p>

<p>But for these instances:</p>

<p>The specialty of rule hath been neglected,</p>

<p>And look how many Grecian tents do stand</p>

<p>Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.</p>

<p>When that the general is not like the hive</p>

<p>To whom the foragers shall all repair,</p>

<p>What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,</p>

<p>Th’ unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.</p>

<p>The heavens themselves, the planets, and this center</p>

<p>Observe degree, priority, and place,</p>

<p>Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,</p>

<p>Office, and custom, in all line of order.</p>

<p>And therefore is the glorious planet Sol</p>

<p>In noble eminence enthroned and sphered</p>

<p>Amidst the other, whose med’cinable eye</p>

<p>Corrects the influence of evil planets,</p>

<p>And posts, like the commandment of a king,</p>

<p>Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets</p>

<p>In evil mixture to disorder wander,</p>

<p>What plagues and what portents, what mutiny,</p>

<p>What raging of the sea, shaking of Earth,</p>

<p>Commotion in the winds, frights, changes, horrors</p>

<p>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate</p>

<p>The unity and married calm of states</p>

<p>Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is shaked,</p>

<p>Which is the ladder of all high designs,</p>

<p>The enterprise is sick. How could communities,</p>

<p>Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,</p>

<p>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,</p>

<p>The primogeneity and due of birth,</p>

<p>Prerogative of age, crowns, scepters, laurels,</p>

<p>But by degree stand in authentic place?</p>

<p>Take but degree away, untune that string,</p>

<p>And hark what discord follows. Each thing meets</p>

<p>In mere oppugnancy. The bounded waters</p>

<p>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores</p>

<p>And make a sop of all this solid globe;</p>

<p>Strength should be lord of imbecility,</p>

<p>And the rude son should strike his father dead;</p>

<p>Force should be right, or, rather, right and wrong,</p>

<p>Between whose endless jar justice resides,</p>

<p>Should lose their names, and so should justice too.</p>

<p>Then everything includes itself in power,</p>

<p>Power into will, will into appetite,</p>

<p>And appetite, an universal wolf,</p>

<p>So doubly seconded with will and power,</p>

<p>Must make perforce an universal prey</p>

<p>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</p>

<p>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</p>

<p>Follows the choking.</p>

<p>And this neglection of degree it is</p>

<p>That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose</p>

<p>It hath to climb. The General’s disdained</p>

<p>By him one step below, he by the next,</p>

<p>That next by him beneath; so every step,</p>

<p>Exampled by the first pace that is sick</p>

<p>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever</p>

<p>Of pale and bloodless emulation.</p>

<p>And ’tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,</p>

<p>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,</p>

<p>Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc></p>

<p>Most wisely hath Ulysses here discovered</p>

<p>The fever whereof all our power is sick.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,</p>

<p>What is the remedy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns</p>

<p>The sinew and the forehand of our host,</p>

<p>Having his ear full of his airy fame,</p>

<p>Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent</p>

<p>Lies mocking our designs. With him Patroclus,</p>

<p>Upon a lazy bed, the live-long day</p>

<p>Breaks scurril jests,</p>

<p>And with ridiculous and silly action,</p>

<p>Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,</p>

<p>He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,</p>

<p>Thy topless deputation he puts on,</p>

<p>And, like a strutting player whose conceit</p>

<p>Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich</p>

<p>To hear the wooden dialogue and sound</p>

<p>’Twixt his stretched footing and the scaffollage,</p>

<p>Such to-be-pitied and o’erwrested seeming</p>

<p>He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks,</p>

<p>’Tis like a chime a-mending, with terms unsquared</p>

<p>Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropped</p>

<p>Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff,</p>

<p>The large Achilles, on his pressed bed lolling,</p>

<p>From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause,</p>

<p>Cries “Excellent! ’Tis Agamemnon right.</p>

<p>Now play me Nestor; hem and stroke thy beard,</p>

<p>As he being dressed to some oration.”</p>

<p>That’s done, as near as the extremest ends</p>

<p>Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;</p>

<p>Yet god Achilles still cries “Excellent!</p>

<p>’Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,</p>

<p>Arming to answer in a night alarm.”</p>

<p>And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age</p>

<p>Must be the scene of mirth–to cough and spit,</p>

<p>And, with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,</p>

<p>Shake in and out the rivet. And at this sport</p>

<p>Sir Valor dies, cries “O, enough, Patroclus,</p>

<p>Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all</p>

<p>In pleasure of my spleen.” And in this fashion,</p>

<p>All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</p>

<p>Severals and generals of grace exact,</p>

<p>Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,</p>

<p>Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,</p>

<p>Success or loss, what is or is not, serves</p>

<p>As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc></p>

<p>And in the imitation of these twain,</p>

<p>Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns</p>

<p>With an imperial voice, many are infect:</p>

<p>Ajax is grown self-willed and bears his head</p>

<p>In such a rein, in full as proud a place</p>

<p>As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him,</p>

<p>Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,</p>

<p>Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites–</p>

<p>A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint–</p>

<p>To match us in comparisons with dirt,</p>

<p>To weaken and discredit our exposure,</p>

<p>How rank soever rounded in with danger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>They tax our policy and call it cowardice,</p>

<p>Count wisdom as no member of the war,</p>

<p>Forestall prescience, and esteem no act</p>

<p>But that of hand. The still and mental parts</p>

<p>That do contrive how many hands shall strike</p>

<p>When fitness calls them on and know by measure</p>

<p>Of their observant toil the enemy’s weight–</p>

<p>Why, this hath not a fingers dignity.</p>

<p>They call this bed-work, mapp’ry, closet war;</p>

<p>So that the ram that batters down the wall,</p>

<p>For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,</p>

<p>They place before his hand that made the engine</p>

<p>Or those that with the fineness of their souls</p>

<p>By reason guide his execution.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc></p>

<p>Let this be granted, and Achilles’ horse</p>

<p>Makes many Thetis’ sons.     <i><i>[Tucket.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  What trumpet? Look, Menelaus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menelaus</sc>  From Troy.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Aeneas, with a Trumpeter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  What would you ’fore our tent?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aeneas</sc></p>

<p>Is this great Agamemnon’s tent, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  Even this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aeneas</sc></p>

<p>May one that is a herald and a prince</p>

<p>Do a fair message to his kingly eyes?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>With surety stronger than Achilles’ arm</p>

<p>’Fore all the Greekish host, which with one voice</p>

<p>Call Agamemnon head and general.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aeneas</sc></p>

<p>Fair leave and large security. How may</p>

<p>A stranger to those most imperial looks</p>

<p>Know them from eyes of other mortals?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  How?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aeneas</sc></p>

<p>Ay. I ask that I might waken reverence</p>

<p>And bid the cheek be ready with a blush</p>

<p>Modest as morning when she coldly eyes</p>

<p>The youthful Phoebus.</p>

<p>Which is that god in office, guiding men?</p>

<p>Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>This Trojan scorns us, or the men of Troy</p>

<p>Are ceremonious courtiers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aeneas</sc></p>

<p>Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarmed,</p>

<p>As bending angels–that’s their fame in peace.</p>

<p>But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,</p>

<p>Good arms, strong joints, true swords, and–great</p>

<p>Jove’s accord–</p>

<p>Nothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas.</p>

<p>Peace, Trojan. Lay thy finger on thy lips.</p>

<p>The worthiness of praise distains his worth</p>

<p>If that the praised himself bring the praise forth.</p>

<p>But what the repining enemy commends,</p>

<p>That breath fame blows; that praise, sole pure,</p>

<p>transcends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aeneas</sc>  Ay, Greek, that is my name.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  What’s your affair, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aeneas</sc></p>

<p>Sir, pardon. ’Tis for Agamemnon’s ears.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aeneas</sc></p>

<p>Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him.</p>

<p>I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,</p>

<p>To set his sense on the attentive bent,</p>

<p>And then to speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  Speak frankly as the wind;</p>

<p>It is not Agamemnon’s sleeping hour.</p>

<p>That thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake,</p>

<p>He tells thee so himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aeneas</sc>  Trumpet, blow loud!</p>

<p>Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;</p>

<p>And every Greek of mettle, let him know</p>

<p>What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sound trumpet.]</i></center></p>

<p>We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy</p>

<p>A prince called Hector–Priam is his father–</p>

<p>Who in this dull and long-continued truce</p>

<p>Is resty grown. He bade me take a trumpet</p>

<p>And to this purpose speak: “Kings, princes, lords,</p>

<p>If there be one among the fair’st of Greece</p>

<p>That holds his honor higher than his ease,</p>

<p>That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,</p>

<p>That knows his valor and knows not his fear,</p>

<p>That loves his mistress more than in confession</p>

<p>With truant vows to her own lips he loves</p>

<p>And dare avow her beauty and her worth</p>

<p>In other arms than hers–to him this challenge.</p>

<p>Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,</p>

<p>Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,</p>

<p>He hath a lady wiser, fairer, truer</p>

<p>Than ever Greek did couple in his arms</p>

<p>And will tomorrow with his trumpet call,</p>

<p>Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,</p>

<p>To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.</p>

<p>If any come, Hector shall honor him;</p>

<p>If none, he’ll say in Troy when he retires</p>

<p>The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth</p>

<p>The splinter of a lance.” Even so much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.</p>

<p>If none of them have soul in such a kind,</p>

<p>We left them all at home. But we are soldiers,</p>

<p>And may that soldier a mere recreant prove</p>

<p>That means not, hath not, or is not in love!</p>

<p>If then one is, or hath, or means to be,</p>

<p>That one meets Hector. If none else, I am he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc> <i>[to Aeneas]</i></p>

<p>Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man</p>

<p>When Hector’s grandsire sucked. He is old now,</p>

<p>But if there be not in our Grecian host</p>

<p>A noble man that hath one spark of fire</p>

<p>To answer for his love, tell him from me</p>

<p>I’ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver</p>

<p>And in my vambrace put my withered brawns</p>

<p>And, meeting him, will tell him that my lady</p>

<p>Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste</p>

<p>As may be in the world. His youth in flood,</p>

<p>I’ll prove this troth with my three drops of blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Aeneas</sc></p>

<p>Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  Amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>Fair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand.</p>

<p>To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.</p>

<p>Achilles shall have word of this intent;</p>

<p>So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent.</p>

<p>Yourself shall feast with us before you go,</p>

<p>And find the welcome of a noble foe.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Ulysses and Nestor exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  Nestor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc>  What says Ulysses?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>I have a young conception in my brain;</p>

<p>Be you my time to bring it to some shape.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc>  What is ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  This ’tis:</p>

<p>Blunt wedges rive hard knots; the seeded pride</p>

<p>That hath to this maturity blown up</p>

<p>In rank Achilles must or now be cropped</p>

<p>Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil</p>

<p>To overbulk us all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc>  Well, and how?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,</p>

<p>However it is spread in general name,</p>

<p>Relates in purpose only to Achilles.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc></p>

<p>True. The purpose is perspicuous as substance</p>

<p>Whose grossness little characters sum up;</p>

<p>And, in the publication, make no strain</p>

<p>But that Achilles, were his brain as barren</p>

<p>As banks of Libya–though, Apollo knows,</p>

<p>’Tis dry enough–will, with great speed of judgment,</p>

<p>Ay, with celerity, find Hector’s purpose</p>

<p>Pointing on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  And wake him to the answer, think you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc></p>

<p>Why, ’tis most meet. Who may you else oppose</p>

<p>That can from Hector bring his honor off</p>

<p>If not Achilles? Though ’t be a sportful combat,</p>

<p>Yet in the trial much opinion dwells,</p>

<p>For here the Trojans taste our dear’st repute</p>

<p>With their fin’st palate. And, trust to me, Ulysses,</p>

<p>Our imputation shall be oddly poised</p>

<p>In this vile action. For the success,</p>

<p>Although particular, shall give a scantling</p>

<p>Of good or bad unto the general;</p>

<p>And in such indexes, although small pricks</p>

<p>To their subsequent volumes, there is seen</p>

<p>The baby figure of the giant mass</p>

<p>Of things to come at large. It is supposed</p>

<p>He that meets Hector issues from our choice;</p>

<p>And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,</p>

<p>Makes merit her election and doth boil,</p>

<p>As ’twere from forth us all, a man distilled</p>

<p>Out of our virtues, who, miscarrying,</p>

<p>What heart receives from hence a conquering part</p>

<p>To steel a strong opinion to themselves?–</p>

<p>Which entertained, limbs are his instruments,</p>

<p>In no less working than are swords and bows</p>

<p>Directive by the limbs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>Give pardon to my speech: therefore ’tis meet</p>

<p>Achilles meet not Hector. Let us like merchants</p>

<p>First show foul wares and think perchance they’ll sell;</p>

<p>If not, the luster of the better shall exceed</p>

<p>By showing the worse first. Do not consent</p>

<p>That ever Hector and Achilles meet,</p>

<p>For both our honor and our shame in this</p>

<p>Are dogged with two strange followers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc></p>

<p>I see them not with my old eyes. What are they?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,</p>

<p>Were he not proud, we all should share with him;</p>

<p>But he already is too insolent,</p>

<p>And it were better parch in Afric sun</p>

<p>Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes</p>

<p>Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foiled,</p>

<p>Why then we do our main opinion crush</p>

<p>In taint of our best man. No, make a lott’ry,</p>

<p>And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw</p>

<p>The sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves</p>

<p>Give him allowance for the better man,</p>

<p>For that will physic the great Myrmidon,</p>

<p>Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall</p>

<p>His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.</p>

<p>If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,</p>

<p>We’ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,</p>

<p>Yet go we under our opinion still</p>

<p>That we have better men. But, hit or miss,</p>

<p>Our project’s life this shape of sense assumes:</p>

<p>Ajax employed plucks down Achilles’ plumes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc></p>

<p>Now, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice,</p>

<p>And I will give a taste thereof forthwith</p>

<p>To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.</p>

<p>Two curs shall tame each other; pride alone</p>

<p>Must tar the mastiffs on, as ’twere a bone.</p>
