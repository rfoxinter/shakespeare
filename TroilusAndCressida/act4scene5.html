<p><center><i>[Enter Ajax, armed, Achilles, Patroclus, Agamemnon,</p>

<p>Menelaus, Ulysses, Nestor, etc. and Trumpeter.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span> <i>[to Ajax]</i></p>

<p>Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,</p>

<p>Anticipating time with starting courage.</p>

<p>Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,</p>

<p>Thou dreadful Ajax, that the appalled air</p>

<p>May pierce the head of the great combatant</p>

<p>And hale him hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ajax</span>  Thou, trumpet, there’s my purse.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives money to Trumpeter.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe.</p>

<p>Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek</p>

<p>Outswell the colic of puffed Aquilon.</p>

<p>Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood.</p>

<p>Thou blowest for Hector.     <i><i>[Sound trumpet.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span></p>

<p>No trumpet answers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span>  ’Tis but early days.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cressida and Diomedes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span></p>

<p>Is not yond Diomed with Calchas’ daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span></p>

<p>’Tis he. I ken the manner of his gait.</p>

<p>He rises on the toe; that spirit of his</p>

<p>In aspiration lifts him from the earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span></p>

<p>Is this the Lady Cressid?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span>  Even she.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span></p>

<p>Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kisses her.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nestor</span></p>

<p>Our general doth salute you with a kiss.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span></p>

<p>Yet is the kindness but particular.</p>

<p>’Twere better she were kissed in general.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nestor</span></p>

<p>And very courtly counsel. I’ll begin.     <i><i>[He kisses her.]</i></i></p>

<p>So much for Nestor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span></p>

<p>I’ll take that winter from your lips, fair lady.</p>

<p>Achilles bids you welcome.     <i><i>[He kisses her.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menelaus</span></p>

<p>I had good argument for kissing once.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patroclus</span> <i>[stepping between Menelaus and Cressida]</i></p>

<p>But that’s no argument for kissing now,</p>

<p>For thus popped Paris in his hardiment</p>

<p>And parted thus you and your argument.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kisses her.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span></p>

<p>O deadly gall and theme of all our scorns,</p>

<p>For which we lose our heads to gild his horns!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patroclus</span></p>

<p>The first was Menelaus’ kiss; this mine.</p>

<p>Patroclus kisses you.     <i><i>[He kisses her again.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menelaus</span>  O, this is trim!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Patroclus</span></p>

<p>Paris and I kiss evermore for him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menelaus</span></p>

<p>I’ll have my kiss, sir.–Lady, by your leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>In kissing, do you render or receive?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menelaus</span></p>

<p>Both take and give.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  I’ll make my match to live,</p>

<p>The kiss you take is better than you give.</p>

<p>Therefore no kiss.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menelaus</span></p>

<p>I’ll give you boot: I’ll give you three for one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>You are an odd man. Give even, or give none.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menelaus</span></p>

<p>An odd man, lady? Every man is odd.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>No, Paris is not, for you know ’tis true</p>

<p>That you are odd, and he is even with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menelaus</span></p>

<p>You fillip me o’ th’ head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  No, I’ll be sworn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span></p>

<p>It were no match, your nail against his horn.</p>

<p>May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>You may.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span>  I do desire it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  Why, beg two.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span></p>

<p>Why, then, for Venus’ sake, give me a kiss</p>

<p>When Helen is a maid again and his.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>I am your debtor; claim it when ’tis due.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span></p>

<p>Never’s my day, and then a kiss of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span></p>

<p>Lady, a word. I’ll bring you to your father.</p>

<p><center><i>[Diomedes and Cressida talk aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nestor</span></p>

<p>A woman of quick sense.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span>  Fie, fie upon her!</p>

<p>There’s language in her eye, her cheek, her lip;</p>

<p>Nay, her foot speaks. Her wanton spirits look out</p>

<p>At every joint and motive of her body.</p>

<p>O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,</p>

<p>That give accosting welcome ere it comes</p>

<p>And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts</p>

<p>To every tickling reader! Set them down</p>

<p>For sluttish spoils of opportunity</p>

<p>And daughters of the game.</p>

<p><center><i>[Diomedes and Cressida exit.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span></p>

<p>The Trojan’s trumpet.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter all of Troy: Hector, armed, Paris, Aeneas,</p>

<p>Helenus, Troilus, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span>  Yonder comes the troop.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>Hail, all the state of Greece! What shall be done</p>

<p>To him that victory commands? Or do you purpose</p>

<p>A victor shall be known? Will you the knights</p>

<p>Shall to the edge of all extremity</p>

<p>Pursue each other, or shall they be divided</p>

<p>By any voice or order of the field?</p>

<p>Hector bade ask.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span>  Which way would Hector have it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>He cares not; he’ll obey conditions.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span></p>

<p>’Tis done like Hector.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span>  But securely done,</p>

<p>A little proudly, and great deal misprizing</p>

<p>The knight opposed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span>  If not Achilles, sir,</p>

<p>What is your name?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span>  If not Achilles, nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>Therefore Achilles. But whate’er, know this:</p>

<p>In the extremity of great and little,</p>

<p>Valor and pride excel themselves in Hector,</p>

<p>The one almost as infinite as all,</p>

<p>The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,</p>

<p>And that which looks like pride is courtesy.</p>

<p>This Ajax is half made of Hector’s blood,</p>

<p>In love whereof half Hector stays at home;</p>

<p>Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek</p>

<p>This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span></p>

<p>A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Diomedes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span></p>

<p>Here is Sir Diomed.–Go, gentle knight;</p>

<p>Stand by our Ajax. As you and Lord Aeneas</p>

<p>Consent upon the order of their fight,</p>

<p>So be it, either to the uttermost</p>

<p>Or else a breath. The combatants being kin</p>

<p>Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Hector and Ajax enter the lists.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span>  They are opposed already.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span></p>

<p>What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span></p>

<p>The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,</p>

<p>Not yet mature, yet matchless firm of word,</p>

<p>Speaking in deeds, and deedless in his tongue,</p>

<p>Not soon provoked, nor being provoked soon calmed,</p>

<p>His heart and hand both open and both free.</p>

<p>For what he has, he gives; what thinks, he shows;</p>

<p>Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,</p>

<p>Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath;</p>

<p>Manly as Hector, but more dangerous,</p>

<p>For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes</p>

<p>To tender objects, but he in heat of action</p>

<p>Is more vindicative than jealous love.</p>

<p>They call him Troilus, and on him erect</p>

<p>A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.</p>

<p>Thus says Aeneas, one that knows the youth</p>

<p>Even to his inches, and with private soul</p>

<p>Did in great Ilium thus translate him to me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Alarum. The fight begins.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span>  They are in action.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nestor</span>  Now, Ajax, hold thine own!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Hector, thou sleep’st. Awake thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span></p>

<p>His blows are well disposed.–There, Ajax!</p>

<p><center><i>[Trumpets cease.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span></p>

<p>You must no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span>  Princes, enough, so please you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ajax</span></p>

<p>I am not warm yet. Let us fight again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span></p>

<p>As Hector pleases.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  Why, then, will I no more.–</p>

<p>Thou art, great lord, my father’s sister’s son,</p>

<p>A cousin-german to great Priam’s seed.</p>

<p>The obligation of our blood forbids</p>

<p>A gory emulation ’twixt us twain.</p>

<p>Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so</p>

<p>That thou couldst say “This hand is Grecian all,</p>

<p>And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg</p>

<p>All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother’s blood</p>

<p>Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister</p>

<p>Bounds in my father’s,” by Jove multipotent,</p>

<p>Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member</p>

<p>Wherein my sword had not impressure made</p>

<p>Of our rank feud. But the just gods gainsay</p>

<p>That any drop thou borrowd’st from thy mother,</p>

<p>My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword</p>

<p>Be drained. Let me embrace thee, Ajax.</p>

<p>By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms!</p>

<p>Hector would have them fall upon him thus.</p>

<p>Cousin, all honor to thee!     <i><i>[They embrace.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ajax</span>  I thank thee, Hector.</p>

<p>Thou art too gentle and too free a man.</p>

<p>I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence</p>

<p>A great addition earned in thy death.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>Not Neoptolemus so mirable–</p>

<p>On whose bright crest Fame with her loud’st “Oyez”</p>

<p>Cries “This is he”–could promise to himself</p>

<p>A thought of added honor torn from Hector.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>There is expectance here from both the sides</p>

<p>What further you will do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  We’ll answer it;</p>

<p>The issue is embracement.–Ajax, farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[They embrace again.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ajax</span></p>

<p>If I might in entreaties find success,</p>

<p>As seld I have the chance, I would desire</p>

<p>My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Diomedes</span></p>

<p>’Tis Agamemnon’s wish; and great Achilles</p>

<p>Doth long to see unarmed the valiant Hector.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>Aeneas, call my brother Troilus to me,</p>

<p>And signify this loving interview</p>

<p>To the expecters of our Trojan part;</p>

<p>Desire them home.</p>

<p><center><i>[Aeneas speaks to Trojans, who exit; he then</p>

<p>returns with Troilus.]</i></center></p>

<p><i>[To Ajax.]</i> Give me thy hand, my cousin.</p>

<p>I will go eat with thee and see your knights.</p>

<p><center><i>[Agamemnon and the rest come forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ajax</span></p>

<p>Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span> <i>[to Aeneas]</i></p>

<p>The worthiest of them tell me name by name;</p>

<p>But for Achilles, my own searching eyes</p>

<p>Shall find him by his large and portly size.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span></p>

<p>Worthy all arms! As welcome as to one</p>

<p>That would be rid of such an enemy–</p>

<p>But that’s no welcome. Understand more clear:</p>

<p>What’s past and what’s to come is strewed with husks</p>

<p>And formless ruin of oblivion;</p>

<p>But in this extant moment, faith and troth,</p>

<p>Strained purely from all hollow bias-drawing,</p>

<p>Bids thee, with most divine integrity,</p>

<p>From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span> <i>[to Troilus]</i></p>

<p>My well-famed lord of Troy, no less to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menelaus</span></p>

<p>Let me confirm my princely brother’s greeting:</p>

<p>You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span> <i>[to Aeneas]</i></p>

<p>Who must we answer?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span>  The noble Menelaus.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>O, you, my lord? By Mars his gauntlet, thanks!</p>

<p>Mock not that I affect th’ untraded oath;</p>

<p>Your quondam wife swears still by Venus’ glove.</p>

<p>She’s well, but bade me not commend her to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Menelaus</span></p>

<p>Name her not now, sir; she’s a deadly theme.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  O, pardon! I offend.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nestor</span></p>

<p>I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft,</p>

<p>Laboring for destiny, make cruel way</p>

<p>Through ranks of Greekish youth; and I have seen</p>

<p>thee,</p>

<p>As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,</p>

<p>Despising many forfeits and subduments,</p>

<p>When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i’ th’ air,</p>

<p>Not letting it decline on the declined,</p>

<p>That I have said to some my standers-by</p>

<p>“Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!”</p>

<p>And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath</p>

<p>When that a ring of Greeks have hemmed thee in,</p>

<p>Like an Olympian wrestling. This have I seen.</p>

<p>But this thy countenance, still locked in steel,</p>

<p>I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire</p>

<p>And once fought with him; he was a soldier good,</p>

<p>But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,</p>

<p>Never like thee! O, let an old man embrace thee;</p>

<p>And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span> <i>[to Hector]</i>  ’Tis the old Nestor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle</p>

<p>That hast so long walked hand in hand with time.</p>

<p>Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[They embrace.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nestor</span></p>

<p>I would my arms could match thee in contention</p>

<p>As they contend with thee in courtesy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  I would they could.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Nestor</span></p>

<p>Ha! By this white beard, I’d fight with thee tomorrow.</p>

<p>Well, welcome, welcome. I have seen the time!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span></p>

<p>I wonder now how yonder city stands</p>

<p>When we have here her base and pillar by us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>I know your favor, Lord Ulysses, well.</p>

<p>Ah, sir, there’s many a Greek and Trojan dead</p>

<p>Since first I saw yourself and Diomed</p>

<p>In Ilium, on your Greekish embassy.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span></p>

<p>Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue.</p>

<p>My prophecy is but half his journey yet,</p>

<p>For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,</p>

<p>Yon towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,</p>

<p>Must kiss their own feet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  I must not believe you.</p>

<p>There they stand yet, and modestly I think</p>

<p>The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost</p>

<p>A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all,</p>

<p>And that old common arbitrator, Time,</p>

<p>Will one day end it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span>  So to him we leave it.</p>

<p>Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome.</p>

<p>After the General, I beseech you next</p>

<p>To feast with me and see me at my tent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span></p>

<p>I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!–</p>

<p>Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;</p>

<p>I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,</p>

<p>And quoted joint by joint.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  Is this Achilles?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span>  I am Achilles.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>Stand fair, I pray thee. Let me look on thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span></p>

<p>Behold thy fill.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  Nay, I have done already.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span></p>

<p>Thou art too brief. I will the second time,</p>

<p>As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>O, like a book of sport thou ’lt read me o’er;</p>

<p>But there’s more in me than thou understand’st.</p>

<p>Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span></p>

<p>Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body</p>

<p>Shall I destroy him–whether there, or there, or</p>

<p>there–</p>

<p>That I may give the local wound a name</p>

<p>And make distinct the very breach whereout</p>

<p>Hector’s great spirit flew. Answer me, heavens!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,</p>

<p>To answer such a question. Stand again.</p>

<p>Think’st thou to catch my life so pleasantly</p>

<p>As to prenominate in nice conjecture</p>

<p>Where thou wilt hit me dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span>  I tell thee, yea.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span></p>

<p>Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,</p>

<p>I’d not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well,</p>

<p>For I’ll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there,</p>

<p>But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,</p>

<p>I’ll kill thee everywhere, yea, o’er and o’er.–</p>

<p>You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;</p>

<p>His insolence draws folly from my lips.</p>

<p>But I’ll endeavor deeds to match these words,</p>

<p>Or may I never–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ajax</span>  Do not chafe thee, cousin.–</p>

<p>And you, Achilles, let these threats alone</p>

<p>Till accident or purpose bring you to ’t.</p>

<p>You may have every day enough of Hector</p>

<p>If you have stomach. The general state, I fear,</p>

<p>Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span> <i>[to Achilles]</i></p>

<p>I pray you, let us see you in the field.</p>

<p>We have had pelting wars since you refused</p>

<p>The Grecians’ cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Achilles</span>  Dost thou entreat me, Hector?</p>

<p>Tomorrow do I meet thee, fell as death;</p>

<p>Tonight all friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hector</span>  Thy hand upon that match.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Agamemnon</span></p>

<p>First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;</p>

<p>There in the full convive we. Afterwards,</p>

<p>As Hector’s leisure and your bounties shall</p>

<p>Concur together, severally entreat him.</p>

<p>Beat loud the taborins; let the trumpets blow,</p>

<p>That this great soldier may his welcome know.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,</p>

<p>In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span></p>

<p>At Menelaus’ tent, most princely Troilus.</p>

<p>There Diomed doth feast with him tonight,</p>

<p>Who neither looks upon the heaven nor Earth,</p>

<p>But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view</p>

<p>On the fair Cressid.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Shall I, sweet lord, be bound to you so much,</p>

<p>After we part from Agamemnon’s tent,</p>

<p>To bring me thither?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ulysses</span>  You shall command me, sir.</p>

<p>As gentle tell me, of what honor was</p>

<p>This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there</p>

<p>That wails her absence?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>O sir, to such as boasting show their scars</p>

<p>A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?</p>

<p>She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth;</p>

<p>But still sweet love is food for Fortune’s tooth.</p>
