<p><center><i>[Enter Hector, armed, and Andromache.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andromache</sc></p>

<p>When was my lord so much ungently tempered</p>

<p>To stop his ears against admonishment?</p>

<p>Unarm, unarm, and do not fight today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc></p>

<p>You train me to offend you. Get you in.</p>

<p>By all the everlasting gods, I’ll go!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andromache</sc></p>

<p>My dreams will sure prove ominous to the day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc></p>

<p>No more, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cassandra.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassandra</sc>  Where is my brother Hector?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andromache</sc></p>

<p>Here, sister, armed and bloody in intent.</p>

<p>Consort with me in loud and dear petition;</p>

<p>Pursue we him on knees. For I have dreamt</p>

<p>Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night</p>

<p>Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassandra</sc></p>

<p>O, ’tis true!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc> <i>[calling out]</i>  Ho! Bid my trumpet sound!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassandra</sc></p>

<p>No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc></p>

<p>Begone, I say. The gods have heard me swear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassandra</sc></p>

<p>The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows.</p>

<p>They are polluted off’rings more abhorred</p>

<p>Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andromache</sc> <i>[to Hector]</i></p>

<p>O, be persuaded! Do not count it holy</p>

<p>To hurt by being just. It is as lawful,</p>

<p>For we would give much, to use violent thefts</p>

<p>And rob in the behalf of charity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassandra</sc></p>

<p>It is the purpose that makes strong the vow,</p>

<p>But vows to every purpose must not hold.</p>

<p>Unarm, sweet Hector.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc>  Hold you still, I say.</p>

<p>Mine honor keeps the weather of my fate.</p>

<p>Life every man holds dear, but the dear man</p>

<p>Holds honor far more precious-dear than life.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Troilus, armed.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, young man? Meanest thou to fight today?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andromache</sc></p>

<p>Cassandra, call my father to persuade.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cassandra exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc></p>

<p>No, faith, young Troilus, doff thy harness, youth.</p>

<p>I am today i’ th’ vein of chivalry.</p>

<p>Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,</p>

<p>And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.</p>

<p>Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,</p>

<p>I’ll stand today for thee and me and Troy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you</p>

<p>Which better fits a lion than a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc></p>

<p>What vice is that? Good Troilus, chide me for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>When many times the captive Grecian falls,</p>

<p>Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,</p>

<p>You bid them rise and live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc></p>

<p>O, ’tis fair play.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  Fool’s play, by heaven. Hector.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc></p>

<p>How now? How now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  For th’ love of all the gods,</p>

<p>Let’s leave the hermit Pity with our mother,</p>

<p>And when we have our armors buckled on,</p>

<p>The venomed Vengeance ride upon our swords,</p>

<p>Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc></p>

<p>Fie, savage, fie!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  Hector, then ’tis wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc></p>

<p>Troilus, I would not have you fight today.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  Who should withhold me?</p>

<p>Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars,</p>

<p>Beck’ning with fiery truncheon my retire;</p>

<p>Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,</p>

<p>Their eyes o’er-galled with recourse of tears;</p>

<p>Nor you, my brother, with your true sword drawn</p>

<p>Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way,</p>

<p>But by my ruin.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Priam and Cassandra.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassandra</sc> <i>[indicating Hector]</i></p>

<p>Lay hold upon him, Priam; hold him fast.</p>

<p>He is thy crutch. Now if thou loose thy stay,</p>

<p>Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,</p>

<p>Fall all together.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Priam</sc>  Come, Hector, come. Go back.</p>

<p>Thy wife hath dreamt, thy mother hath had visions,</p>

<p>Cassandra doth foresee, and I myself</p>

<p>Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt</p>

<p>To tell thee that this day is ominous.</p>

<p>Therefore, come back.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc>  Aeneas is afield,</p>

<p>And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,</p>

<p>Even in the faith of valor, to appear</p>

<p>This morning to them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Priam</sc>  Ay, but thou shalt not go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc>  I must not break my faith.</p>

<p>You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,</p>

<p>Let me not shame respect, but give me leave</p>

<p>To take that course by your consent and voice</p>

<p>Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassandra</sc></p>

<p>O Priam, yield not to him!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Andromache</sc>  Do not, dear father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc></p>

<p>Andromache, I am offended with you.</p>

<p>Upon the love you bear me, get you in.</p>

<p><center><i>[Andromache exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl</p>

<p>Makes all these bodements.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassandra</sc>  O farewell, dear Hector.</p>

<p>Look how thou diest! Look how thy eye turns pale!</p>

<p>Look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!</p>

<p>Hark, how Troy roars, how Hecuba cries out,</p>

<p>How poor Andromache shrills her dolor forth!</p>

<p>Behold, distraction, frenzy, and amazement,</p>

<p>Like witless antics, one another meet,</p>

<p>And all cry “Hector! Hector’s dead! O, Hector!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  Away, away!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassandra</sc></p>

<p>Farewell.–Yet soft! Hector, I take my leave.</p>

<p>Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hector</sc></p>

<p>You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim.</p>

<p>Go in and cheer the town. We’ll forth and fight,</p>

<p>Do deeds worth praise, and tell you them at night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Priam</sc></p>

<p>Farewell. The gods with safety stand about thee!</p>

<p><center><i>[Hector and Priam exit at separate doors.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Alarum.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,</p>

<p>I come to lose my arm or win my sleeve.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pandarus, with a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Do you hear, my lord? Do you hear?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  What now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Here’s a letter come from yond poor girl.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc>  Let me read.     <i><i>[He reads.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  A whoreson phthisic, a whoreson rascally</p>

<p>phthisic so troubles me, and the foolish fortune of</p>

<p>this girl, and what one thing, what another, that I</p>

<p>shall leave you one o’ these days. And I have a</p>

<p>rheum in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my</p>

<p>bones that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell</p>

<p>what to think on ’t.–What says she there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Troilus</sc></p>

<p>Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart.</p>

<p>Th’ effect doth operate another way.</p>

<p>Go, wind, to wind! There turn and change together.</p>

<p><center><i>[He tears up the paper and throws the pieces in the air.]</i></center></p>

<p>My love with words and errors still she feeds,</p>

<p>But edifies another with her deeds.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
