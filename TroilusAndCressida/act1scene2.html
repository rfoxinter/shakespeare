<p><center><i>[Enter Cressida and her man Alexander.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc></p>

<p>Who were those went by?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexander</sc>  Queen Hecuba and Helen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc></p>

<p>And whither go they?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexander</sc>  Up to the eastern tower,</p>

<p>Whose height commands as subject all the vale,</p>

<p>To see the battle. Hector, whose patience</p>

<p>Is as a virtue fixed, today was moved.</p>

<p>He chid Andromache and struck his armorer;</p>

<p>And, like as there were husbandry in war,</p>

<p>Before the sun rose he was harnessed light,</p>

<p>And to the field goes he, where every flower</p>

<p>Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw</p>

<p>In Hector’s wrath.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  What was his cause of anger?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexander</sc></p>

<p>The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks</p>

<p>A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector.</p>

<p>They call him Ajax.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Good; and what of him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexander</sc></p>

<p>They say he is a very man per se</p>

<p>And stands alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  So do all men unless they are drunk, sick,</p>

<p>or have no legs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexander</sc>  This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts</p>

<p>of their particular additions. He is as valiant as the</p>

<p>lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant, a</p>

<p>man into whom nature hath so crowded humors</p>

<p>that his valor is crushed into folly, his folly sauced</p>

<p>with discretion. There is no man hath a virtue that</p>

<p>he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint</p>

<p>but he carries some stain of it. He is melancholy</p>

<p>without cause and merry against the hair. He hath</p>

<p>the joints of everything, but everything so out of</p>

<p>joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and</p>

<p>no use, or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  But how should this man that makes me</p>

<p>smile make Hector angry?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexander</sc>  They say he yesterday coped Hector in the</p>

<p>battle and struck him down, the disdain and</p>

<p>shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting</p>

<p>and waking.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pandarus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexander</sc>  Madam, your Uncle Pandarus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Hector’s a gallant man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Alexander</sc>  As may be in the world, lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  What’s that? What’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Good morrow, Uncle Pandarus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Good morrow, Cousin Cressid. What do you</p>

<p>talk of?– Good morrow, Alexander.–How do you,</p>

<p>cousin? When were you at Ilium?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  This morning, uncle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  What were you talking of when I came?</p>

<p>Was Hector armed and gone ere you came to</p>

<p>Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  E’en so. Hector was stirring early.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  That were we talking of, and of his anger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Was he angry?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  So he says here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  True, he was so. I know the cause too. He’ll</p>

<p>lay about him today, I can tell them that; and</p>

<p>there’s Troilus will not come far behind him. Let</p>

<p>them take heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  What, is he angry too?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of</p>

<p>the two.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  O Jupiter, there’s no comparison.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do</p>

<p>you know a man if you see him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not</p>

<p>Hector.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  ’Tis just to each of them; he is himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Himself? Alas, poor Troilus, I would he were.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  So he is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Condition I had gone barefoot to India.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  He is not Hector.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Himself? No, he’s not himself. Would he</p>

<p>were himself! Well, the gods are above. Time must</p>

<p>friend or end. Well, Troilus, well, I would my heart</p>

<p>were in her body. No, Hector is not a better man</p>

<p>than Troilus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Excuse me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  He is elder.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Pardon me, pardon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Th’ other’s not come to ’t. You shall tell me</p>

<p>another tale when th’ other’s come to ’t. Hector</p>

<p>shall not have his wit this year.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  He shall not need it, if he have his own.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Nor his qualities.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  No matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Nor his beauty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  ’Twould not become him. His own ’s better.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  You have no judgment, niece. Helen herself</p>

<p>swore th’ other day that Troilus, for a brown favor–</p>

<p>for so ’tis, I must confess–not brown neither–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  No, but brown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  To say the truth, true and not true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  She praised his complexion above Paris’.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Why, Paris hath color enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  So he has.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Then Troilus should have too much. If she</p>

<p>praised him above, his complexion is higher than</p>

<p>his. He having color enough, and the other higher,</p>

<p>is too flaming a praise for a good complexion. I</p>

<p>had as lief Helen’s golden tongue had commended</p>

<p>Troilus for a copper nose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  I swear to you, I think Helen loves him better</p>

<p>than Paris.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Then she’s a merry Greek indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him</p>

<p>th’ other day into the compassed window–and</p>

<p>you know he has not past three or four hairs on his</p>

<p>chin–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Indeed, a tapster’s arithmetic may soon bring</p>

<p>his particulars therein to a total.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Why, he is very young, and yet will he within</p>

<p>three pound lift as much as his brother Hector.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she</p>

<p>came and puts me her white hand to his cloven</p>

<p>chin–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Why, you know ’tis dimpled. I think his</p>

<p>smiling becomes him better than any man in all</p>

<p>Phrygia.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  O, he smiles valiantly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Does he not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  O yes, an ’twere a cloud in autumn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Why, go to, then. But to prove to you that</p>

<p>Helen loves Troilus–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Troilus will stand to the proof if you’ll</p>

<p>prove it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Troilus? Why, he esteems her no more than</p>

<p>I esteem an addle egg.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  If you love an addle egg as well as you love</p>

<p>an idle head, you would eat chickens i’ th’ shell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  I cannot choose but laugh to think how she</p>

<p>tickled his chin. Indeed, she has a marvellous</p>

<p>white hand, I must needs confess–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Without the rack.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  And she takes upon her to spy a white hair</p>

<p>on his chin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Alas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba</p>

<p>laughed that her eyes ran o’er–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  With millstones.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  And Cassandra laughed–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  But there was a more temperate fire under</p>

<p>the pot of her eyes. Did her eyes run o’er too?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  And Hector laughed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  At what was all this laughing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on</p>

<p>Troilus’ chin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  An ’t had been a green hair, I should have</p>

<p>laughed too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  They laughed not so much at the hair as at</p>

<p>his pretty answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  What was his answer?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Quoth she “Here’s but two-and-fifty hairs</p>

<p>on your chin, and one of them is white.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  This is her question.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  That’s true, make no question of that. “Two-and-fifty</p>

<p>hairs,” quoth he, “and one white. That</p>

<p>white hair is my father, and all the rest are his</p>

<p>sons.” “Jupiter!” quoth she, “which of these hairs</p>

<p>is Paris, my husband?” “The forked one,” quoth he.</p>

<p>“Pluck ’t out, and give it him.” But there was such</p>

<p>laughing, and Helen so blushed, and Paris so</p>

<p>chafed, and all the rest so laughed that it passed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  So let it now, for it has been a great while</p>

<p>going by.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday.</p>

<p>Think on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  So I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  I’ll be sworn ’tis true. He will weep you an</p>

<p>’twere a man born in April.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  And I’ll spring up in his tears an ’twere a nettle</p>

<p>against May.     <i><i>[Sound a retreat.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Hark, they are coming from the field. Shall</p>

<p>we stand up here and see them as they pass toward</p>

<p>Ilium? Good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  At your pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Here, here, here’s an excellent place. Here</p>

<p>we may see most bravely. I’ll tell you them all by</p>

<p>their names as they pass by, but mark Troilus</p>

<p>above the rest.</p>

<p><center><i>[They cross the stage; Alexander exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Speak not so loud.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Aeneas and crosses the stage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  That’s Aeneas. Is not that a brave man? He’s</p>

<p>one of the flowers of Troy, I can tell you. But mark</p>

<p>Troilus; you shall see anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Antenor and crosses the stage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Who’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  That’s Antenor. He has a shrewd wit, I can</p>

<p>tell you, and he’s a man good enough. He’s one o’</p>

<p>th’ soundest judgments in Troy whosoever; and a</p>

<p>proper man of person. When comes Troilus? I’ll</p>

<p>show you Troilus anon. If he see me, you shall see</p>

<p>him nod at me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Will he give you the nod?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  You shall see.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  If he do, the rich shall have more.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hector and crosses the stage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  That’s Hector, that, that, look you, that.</p>

<p>There’s a fellow!–Go thy way, Hector!–There’s a</p>

<p>brave man, niece. O brave Hector! Look how he</p>

<p>looks. There’s a countenance! Is ’t not a brave man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  O, a brave man!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Is he not? It does a man’s heart good. Look</p>

<p>you what hacks are on his helmet. Look you yonder,</p>

<p>do you see? Look you there. There’s no jesting;</p>

<p>there’s laying on, take ’t off who will, as they say.</p>

<p>There be hacks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Be those with swords?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Swords, anything, he cares not. An the devil</p>

<p>come to him, it’s all one. By God’s lid, it does one’s</p>

<p>heart good.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Paris and crosses the stage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris! Look you</p>

<p>yonder, niece. Is ’t not a gallant man too? Is ’t not?</p>

<p>Why, this is brave now. Who said he came hurt</p>

<p>home today? He’s not hurt. Why, this will do</p>

<p>Helen’s heart good now, ha? Would I could see</p>

<p>Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Helenus and crosses the stage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Who’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  That’s Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is.</p>

<p>That’s Helenus. I think he went not forth today.</p>

<p>That’s Helenus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Can Helenus fight, uncle?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Helenus? No. Yes, he’ll fight indifferent</p>

<p>well. I marvel where Troilus is. Hark, do you not</p>

<p>hear the people cry “Troilus”? Helenus is a priest.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Troilus and crosses the stage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  What sneaking fellow comes yonder?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Where? Yonder? That’s Deiphobus. ’Tis</p>

<p>Troilus! There’s a man, niece. Hem! Brave Troilus,</p>

<p>the prince of chivalry!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Peace, for shame, peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Mark him. Note him. O brave Troilus! Look</p>

<p>well upon him, niece. Look you how his sword is</p>

<p>bloodied and his helm more hacked than Hector’s,</p>

<p>and how he looks, and how he goes. O admirable</p>

<p>youth! He never saw three and twenty.–Go thy</p>

<p>way, Troilus; go thy way!–Had I a sister were a</p>

<p>Grace, or a daughter a goddess, he should take his</p>

<p>choice. O admirable man! Paris? Paris is dirt to</p>

<p>him; and I warrant Helen, to change, would give</p>

<p>an eye to boot.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Common Soldiers and cross the stage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Here comes more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Asses, fools, dolts, chaff and bran, chaff and</p>

<p>bran, porridge after meat. I could live and die in</p>

<p>the eyes of Troilus. Ne’er look, ne’er look; the</p>

<p>eagles are gone. Crows and daws, crows and daws!</p>

<p>I had rather be such a man as Troilus than</p>

<p>Agamemnon and all Greece.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  There is amongst the Greeks Achilles, a better</p>

<p>man than Troilus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Achilles? A drayman, a porter, a very camel!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Well, well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  “Well, well”? Why, have you any discretion?</p>

<p>Have you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is</p>

<p>not birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,</p>

<p>learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality and</p>

<p>such-like the spice and salt that season a man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Ay, a minced man; and then to be baked with</p>

<p>no date in the pie, for then the man’s date is out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  You are such a woman a man knows not at</p>

<p>what ward you lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Upon my back to defend my belly, upon my</p>

<p>wit to defend my wiles, upon my secrecy to defend</p>

<p>mine honesty, my mask to defend my beauty, and</p>

<p>you to defend all these; and at all these wards I lie,</p>

<p>at a thousand watches.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Say one of your watches.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Nay, I’ll watch you for that, and that’s one of</p>

<p>the chiefest of them too. If I cannot ward what I</p>

<p>would not have hit, I can watch you for telling how</p>

<p>I took the blow–unless it swell past hiding, and</p>

<p>then it’s past watching.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  You are such another!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Troilus’s Boy.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Where?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Boy</sc>  At your own house. There he unarms him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Good boy, tell him I come.     <i><i>[Boy exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>I doubt he be hurt.–Fare you well, good niece.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  Adieu, uncle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  I will be with you, niece, by and by.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  To bring, uncle?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Pandarus</sc>  Ay, a token from Troilus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cressida</sc>  By the same token, you are a bawd.</p>

<p><center><i>[Pandarus exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love’s full sacrifice</p>

<p>He offers in another’s enterprise;</p>

<p>But more in Troilus thousandfold I see</p>

<p>Than in the glass of Pandar’s praise may be.</p>

<p>Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing;</p>

<p>Things won are done; joy’s soul lies in the doing.</p>

<p>That she beloved knows naught that knows not this:</p>

<p>Men prize the thing ungained more than it is.</p>

<p>That she was never yet that ever knew</p>

<p>Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.</p>

<p>Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:</p>

<p>Achievement is command; ungained, beseech.</p>

<p>Then though my heart’s content firm love doth bear,</p>

<p>Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.</p>
