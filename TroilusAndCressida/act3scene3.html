<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter Ulysses, Diomedes, Nestor,</p>

<p>Agamemnon, Calchas, Menelaus, and Ajax.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Calchas</sc></p>

<p>Now, princes, for the service I have done you,</p>

<p>Th’ advantage of the time prompts me aloud</p>

<p>To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind</p>

<p>That, through the sight I bear in things to come,</p>

<p>I have abandoned Troy, left my possessions,</p>

<p>Incurred a traitor’s name, exposed myself,</p>

<p>From certain and possessed conveniences,</p>

<p>To doubtful fortunes, sequest’ring from me all</p>

<p>That time, acquaintance, custom, and condition</p>

<p>Made tame and most familiar to my nature,</p>

<p>And here, to do you service, am become</p>

<p>As new into the world, strange, unacquainted.</p>

<p>I do beseech you, as in way of taste,</p>

<p>To give me now a little benefit</p>

<p>Out of those many regist’red in promise,</p>

<p>Which you say live to come in my behalf.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>What wouldst thou of us, Trojan, make demand?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Calchas</sc></p>

<p>You have a Trojan prisoner called Antenor</p>

<p>Yesterday took. Troy holds him very dear.</p>

<p>Oft have you–often have you thanks therefor–</p>

<p>Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,</p>

<p>Whom Troy hath still denied; but this Antenor,</p>

<p>I know, is such a wrest in their affairs</p>

<p>That their negotiations all must slack,</p>

<p>Wanting his manage; and they will almost</p>

<p>Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,</p>

<p>In change of him. Let him be sent, great princes,</p>

<p>And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence</p>

<p>Shall quite strike off all service I have done</p>

<p>In most accepted pain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  Let Diomedes bear him,</p>

<p>And bring us Cressid hither. Calchas shall have</p>

<p>What he requests of us. Good Diomed,</p>

<p>Furnish you fairly for this interchange.</p>

<p>Withal, bring word if Hector will tomorrow</p>

<p>Be answered in his challenge. Ajax is ready.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Diomedes</sc></p>

<p>This shall I undertake, and ’tis a burden</p>

<p>Which I am proud to bear.     <i><i>[He exits with Calchas.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Achilles and Patroclus stand in their tent.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>Achilles stands i’ th’ entrance of his tent.</p>

<p>Please it our General pass strangely by him</p>

<p>As if he were forgot, and, princes all,</p>

<p>Lay negligent and loose regard upon him.</p>

<p>I will come last. ’Tis like he’ll question me</p>

<p>Why such unplausive eyes are bent, why turned on</p>

<p>him.</p>

<p>If so, I have derision medicinable</p>

<p>To use between your strangeness and his pride,</p>

<p>Which his own will shall have desire to drink.</p>

<p>It may do good; pride hath no other glass</p>

<p>To show itself but pride, for supple knees</p>

<p>Feed arrogance and are the proud man’s fees.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc></p>

<p>We’ll execute your purpose and put on</p>

<p>A form of strangeness as we pass along;</p>

<p>So do each lord, and either greet him not</p>

<p>Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more</p>

<p>Than if not looked on. I will lead the way.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[They pass before Achilles and Patroclus. Ulysses</p>

<p>remains in place, reading.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc></p>

<p>What, comes the General to speak with me?</p>

<p>You know my mind: I’ll fight no more ’gainst Troy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc> <i>[to Nestor]</i></p>

<p>What says Achilles? Would he aught with us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc> <i>[to Achilles]</i></p>

<p>Would you, my lord, aught with the General?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Nestor</sc>  Nothing, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Agamemnon</sc>  The better.     <i><i>[Agamemnon and Nestor exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc> <i>[to Menelaus]</i>  Good day, good day.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Menelaus</sc>  How do you? How do you?     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  What, does the cuckold scorn me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  How now, Patroclus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Good morrow, Ajax.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Good morrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Ay, and good next day too.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc></p>

<p>What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc></p>

<p>They pass by strangely. They were used to bend,</p>

<p>To send their smiles before them to Achilles,</p>

<p>To come as humbly as they use to creep</p>

<p>To holy altars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  What, am I poor of late?</p>

<p>’Tis certain, greatness, once fall’n out with Fortune,</p>

<p>Must fall out with men too. What the declined is</p>

<p>He shall as soon read in the eyes of others</p>

<p>As feel in his own fall, for men, like butterflies,</p>

<p>Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,</p>

<p>And not a man, for being simply man,</p>

<p>Hath any honor, but honor for those honors</p>

<p>That are without him–as place, riches, and favor,</p>

<p>Prizes of accident as oft as merit,</p>

<p>Which, when they fall, as being slippery slanders,</p>

<p>The love that leaned on them, as slippery too,</p>

<p>Doth one pluck down another and together</p>

<p>Die in the fall. But ’tis not so with me.</p>

<p>Fortune and I are friends. I do enjoy,</p>

<p>At ample point, all that I did possess,</p>

<p>Save these men’s looks, who do, methinks, find out</p>

<p>Something not worth in me such rich beholding</p>

<p>As they have often given. Here is Ulysses.</p>

<p>I’ll interrupt his reading.–How now, Ulysses?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  Now, great Thetis’ son–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  What are you reading?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  A strange fellow here</p>

<p>Writes me that man, how dearly ever parted,</p>

<p>How much in having, or without or in,</p>

<p>Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,</p>

<p>Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;</p>

<p>As when his virtues, shining upon others,</p>

<p>Heat them, and they retort that heat again</p>

<p>To the first giver.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  This is not strange, Ulysses.</p>

<p>The beauty that is borne here in the face</p>

<p>The bearer knows not, but commends itself</p>

<p>To others’ eyes; nor doth the eye itself,</p>

<p>That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,</p>

<p>Not going from itself, but eye to eye opposed</p>

<p>Salutes each other with each other’s form.</p>

<p>For speculation turns not to itself</p>

<p>Till it hath traveled and is mirrored there</p>

<p>Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>I do not strain at the position–</p>

<p>It is familiar–but at the author’s drift,</p>

<p>Who in his circumstance expressly proves</p>

<p>That no man is the lord of anything–</p>

<p>Though in and of him there be much consisting–</p>

<p>Till he communicate his parts to others;</p>

<p>Nor doth he of himself know them for aught</p>

<p>Till he behold them formed in the applause</p>

<p>Where they’re extended; who, like an arch, reverb’rate</p>

<p>The voice again or, like a gate of steel</p>

<p>Fronting the sun, receives and renders back</p>

<p>His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this</p>

<p>And apprehended here immediately</p>

<p>Th’ unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there!</p>

<p>A very horse, that has he knows not what!</p>

<p>Nature, what things there are</p>

<p>Most abject in regard, and dear in use,</p>

<p>What things again most dear in the esteem</p>

<p>And poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow–</p>

<p>An act that very chance doth throw upon him–</p>

<p>Ajax renowned. O, heavens, what some men do</p>

<p>While some men leave to do!</p>

<p>How some men creep in skittish Fortune’s hall,</p>

<p>Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!</p>

<p>How one man eats into another’s pride,</p>

<p>While pride is fasting in his wantonness!</p>

<p>To see these Grecian lords–why, even already</p>

<p>They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder</p>

<p>As if his foot were on brave Hector’s breast</p>

<p>And great Troy shrieking.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc></p>

<p>I do believe it, for they passed by me</p>

<p>As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me</p>

<p>Good word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc></p>

<p>Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back</p>

<p>Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,</p>

<p>A great-sized monster of ingratitudes.</p>

<p>Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devoured</p>

<p>As fast as they are made, forgot as soon</p>

<p>As done. Perseverance, dear my lord,</p>

<p>Keeps honor bright. To have done is to hang</p>

<p>Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail</p>

<p>In monumental mock’ry. Take the instant way,</p>

<p>For honor travels in a strait so narrow</p>

<p>Where one but goes abreast. Keep, then, the path,</p>

<p>For Emulation hath a thousand sons</p>

<p>That one by one pursue. If you give way</p>

<p>Or turn aside from the direct forthright,</p>

<p>Like to an entered tide they all rush by</p>

<p>And leave you hindmost;</p>

<p>Or, like a gallant horse fall’n in first rank,</p>

<p>Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,</p>

<p>O’errun and trampled on. Then what they do in</p>

<p>present,</p>

<p>Though less than yours in past, must o’ertop yours;</p>

<p>For Time is like a fashionable host</p>

<p>That slightly shakes his parting guest by th’ hand</p>

<p>And, with his arms outstretched as he would fly,</p>

<p>Grasps in the comer. Welcome ever smiles,</p>

<p>And Farewell goes out sighing. Let not virtue seek</p>

<p>Remuneration for the thing it was,</p>

<p>For beauty, wit,</p>

<p>High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,</p>

<p>Love, friendship, charity are subjects all</p>

<p>To envious and calumniating Time.</p>

<p>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,</p>

<p>That all, with one consent, praise newborn gauds,</p>

<p>Though they are made and molded of things past,</p>

<p>And give to dust that is a little gilt</p>

<p>More laud than gilt o’erdusted.</p>

<p>The present eye praises the present object.</p>

<p>Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,</p>

<p>That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,</p>

<p>Since things in motion sooner catch the eye</p>

<p>Than what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,</p>

<p>And still it might, and yet it may again,</p>

<p>If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive</p>

<p>And case thy reputation in thy tent,</p>

<p>Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late</p>

<p>Made emulous missions ’mongst the gods themselves</p>

<p>And drave great Mars to faction.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Of this my privacy,</p>

<p>I have strong reasons.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  But ’gainst your privacy</p>

<p>The reasons are more potent and heroical.</p>

<p>’Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love</p>

<p>With one of Priam’s daughters.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Ha? Known?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ulysses</sc>  Is that a wonder?</p>

<p>The providence that’s in a watchful state</p>

<p>Knows almost every grain of Pluto’s gold,</p>

<p>Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deep,</p>

<p>Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,</p>

<p>Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.</p>

<p>There is a mystery–with whom relation</p>

<p>Durst never meddle–in the soul of state,</p>

<p>Which hath an operation more divine</p>

<p>Than breath or pen can give expressure to.</p>

<p>All the commerce that you have had with Troy</p>

<p>As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;</p>

<p>And better would it fit Achilles much</p>

<p>To throw down Hector than Polyxena.</p>

<p>But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home</p>

<p>When Fame shall in our islands sound her trump,</p>

<p>And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing</p>

<p>“Great Hector’s sister did Achilles win,</p>

<p>But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.”</p>

<p>Farewell, my lord. I as your lover speak.</p>

<p>The fool slides o’er the ice that you should break.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc></p>

<p>To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you.</p>

<p>A woman impudent and mannish grown</p>

<p>Is not more loathed than an effeminate man</p>

<p>In time of action. I stand condemned for this.</p>

<p>They think my little stomach to the war,</p>

<p>And your great love to me, restrains you thus.</p>

<p>Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid</p>

<p>Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold</p>

<p>And, like a dewdrop from the lion’s mane,</p>

<p>Be shook to air.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Shall Ajax fight with Hector?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc></p>

<p>Ay, and perhaps receive much honor by him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc></p>

<p>I see my reputation is at stake;</p>

<p>My fame is shrewdly gored.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  O, then, beware!</p>

<p>Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves.</p>

<p>Omission to do what is necessary</p>

<p>Seals a commission to a blank of danger,</p>

<p>And danger, like an ague, subtly taints</p>

<p>Even then when they sit idly in the sun.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc></p>

<p>Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.</p>

<p>I’ll send the fool to Ajax and desire him</p>

<p>T’ invite the Trojan lords after the combat</p>

<p>To see us here unarmed. I have a woman’s longing,</p>

<p>An appetite that I am sick withal,</p>

<p>To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,</p>

<p>To talk with him, and to behold his visage,</p>

<p>Even to my full of view.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Thersites.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>A labor saved.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  A wonder!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  What?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for</p>

<p>himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  How so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector</p>

<p>and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgeling</p>

<p>that he raves in saying nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  How can that be?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock–</p>

<p>a stride and a stand; ruminates like an hostess</p>

<p>that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set</p>

<p>down her reckoning; bites his lip with a politic regard,</p>

<p>as who should say “There were wit in this</p>

<p>head an ’twould out”–and so there is, but it lies</p>

<p>as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not</p>

<p>show without knocking. The man’s undone forever,</p>

<p>for if Hector break not his neck i’ th’ combat,</p>

<p>he’ll break ’t himself in vainglory. He knows not</p>

<p>me. I said “Good morrow, Ajax,” and he replies</p>

<p>“Thanks, Agamemnon.” What think you of this</p>

<p>man that takes me for the General? He’s grown a</p>

<p>very land-fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of</p>

<p>opinion! A man may wear it on both sides, like a</p>

<p>leather jerkin.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Thou must be my ambassador to him,</p>

<p>Thersites.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Who, I? Why, he’ll answer nobody. He professes</p>

<p>not answering; speaking is for beggars; he</p>

<p>wears his tongue in ’s arms. I will put on his presence.</p>

<p>Let Patroclus make his demands to me. You</p>

<p>shall see the pageant of Ajax.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  To him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire</p>

<p>the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector</p>

<p>to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure safe-conduct</p>

<p>for his person of the magnanimous and</p>

<p>most illustrious, six-or-seven-times-honored captain</p>

<p>general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,</p>

<p>et cetera. Do this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc> <i>[to Thersites, who is playing Ajax]</i>  Jove</p>

<p>bless great Ajax.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Hum!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  I come from the worthy Achilles–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  Who most humbly desires you to invite</p>

<p>Hector to his tent–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Hum!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  And to procure safe-conduct from</p>

<p>Agamemnon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Agamemnon?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  Ay, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Ha!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  What say you to ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  God b’ wi’ you, with all my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  Your answer, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  If tomorrow be a fair day, by eleven of the</p>

<p>clock it will go one way or other. Howsoever, he</p>

<p>shall pay for me ere he has me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  Your answer, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Fare you well with all my heart.</p>

<p><center><i>[He pretends to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  No, but he’s out of tune thus. What music</p>

<p>will be in him when Hector has knocked out his</p>

<p>brains I know not. But I am sure none, unless the</p>

<p>fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him</p>

<p>straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Let me bear another to his horse, for that’s</p>

<p>the more capable creature.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc></p>

<p>My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirred,</p>

<p>And I myself see not the bottom of it.</p>

<p><center><i>[Achilles and Patroclus exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Would the fountain of your mind were clear</p>

<p>again, that I might water an ass at it. I had rather</p>

<p>be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.</p>
