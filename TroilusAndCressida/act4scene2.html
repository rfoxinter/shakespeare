<p><center><i>[Enter Troilus and Cressida.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Dear, trouble not yourself. The morn is cold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>Then, sweet my lord, I’ll call mine uncle down.</p>

<p>He shall unbolt the gates.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Trouble him not.</p>

<p>To bed, to bed! Sleep kill those pretty eyes</p>

<p>And give as soft attachment to thy senses</p>

<p>As infants’ empty of all thought!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  I prithee now, to bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  Are you aweary of me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>O Cressida! But that the busy day,</p>

<p>Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,</p>

<p>And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,</p>

<p>I would not from thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  Night hath been too brief.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span></p>

<p>Beshrew the witch! With venomous wights she stays</p>

<p>As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love</p>

<p>With wings more momentary-swift than thought.</p>

<p>You will catch cold and curse me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>Prithee, tarry. You men will never tarry.</p>

<p>O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,</p>

<p>And then you would have tarried. Hark, there’s one up.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span> <i>[within]</i>  What’s all the doors open here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  It is your uncle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>A pestilence on him! Now will he be mocking.</p>

<p>I shall have such a life!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pandarus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  How now, how now? How go maidenheads?</p>

<p>Here, you maid! Where’s my Cousin Cressid?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle.</p>

<p>You bring me to do–and then you flout me too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  To do what, to do what?–Let her say</p>

<p>what.–What have I brought you to do?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>Come, come, beshrew your heart! You’ll ne’er be good</p>

<p>Nor suffer others.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Ha, ha! Alas, poor wretch! Ah, poor capocchia!</p>

<p>Has ’t not slept tonight? Would he not–a</p>

<p>naughty man–let it sleep? A bugbear take him!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span> <i>[to Troilus]</i></p>

<p>Did not I tell you? Would he were knocked i’ th’ head!</p>

<p><center><i>[One knocks.]</i></center></p>

<p>Who’s that at door?–Good uncle, go and see.–</p>

<p>My lord, come you again into my chamber.</p>

<p>You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Ha, ha!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>Come, you are deceived. I think of no such thing.</p>

<p><center><i>[Knock.]</i></center></p>

<p>How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in.</p>

<p>I would not for half Troy have you seen here.</p>

<p><center><i>[Troilus and Cressida exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Who’s there? What’s the matter? Will you</p>

<p>beat down the door?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Aeneas.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now? What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span>  Good morrow, lord, good morrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Who’s there? My Lord Aeneas? By my troth,</p>

<p>I knew you not. What news with you so early?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span>  Is not Prince Troilus here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Here? What should he do here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>Come, he is here, my lord. Do not deny him.</p>

<p>It doth import him much to speak with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Is he here, say you? It’s more than I know,</p>

<p>I’ll be sworn. For my own part, I came in late.</p>

<p>What should he do here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span>  Ho, nay, then! Come, come, you’ll do him</p>

<p>wrong ere you are ware. You’ll be so true to him to</p>

<p>be false to him. Do not you know of him, but yet go</p>

<p>fetch him hither. Go.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Troilus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  How now? What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,</p>

<p>My matter is so rash. There is at hand</p>

<p>Paris your brother and Deiphobus,</p>

<p>The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor</p>

<p>Delivered to us; and for him forthwith,</p>

<p>Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,</p>

<p>We must give up to Diomedes’ hand</p>

<p>The Lady Cressida.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  Is it so concluded?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>By Priam and the general state of Troy.</p>

<p>They are at hand and ready to effect it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Troilus</span>  How my achievements mock me!</p>

<p>I will go meet them. And, my Lord Aeneas,</p>

<p>We met by chance; you did not find me here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Aeneas</span></p>

<p>Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature</p>

<p>Have not more gift in taciturnity.</p>

<p><center><i>[Troilus and Aeneas exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Is ’t possible? No sooner got but lost? The</p>

<p>devil take Antenor! The young prince will go mad.</p>

<p>A plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke ’s</p>

<p>neck!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cressida.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>How now? What’s the matter? Who was here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Ah, ah!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>Why sigh you so profoundly? Where’s my lord?</p>

<p>Gone? Tell me, sweet uncle, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Would I were as deep under the earth as I</p>

<p>am above!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  O the gods! What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Pray thee, get thee in. Would thou hadst</p>

<p>ne’er been born! I knew thou wouldst be his death.</p>

<p>O, poor gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span>  Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees I</p>

<p>beseech you, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Thou must be gone, wench; thou must be</p>

<p>gone. Thou art changed for Antenor. Thou must to</p>

<p>thy father and be gone from Troilus. ’Twill be his</p>

<p>death; ’twill be his bane. He cannot bear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>O you immortal gods! I will not go.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Thou must.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>I will not, uncle. I have forgot my father.</p>

<p>I know no touch of consanguinity,</p>

<p>No kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me</p>

<p>As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine,</p>

<p>Make Cressid’s name the very crown of falsehood</p>

<p>If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death</p>

<p>Do to this body what extremes you can,</p>

<p>But the strong base and building of my love</p>

<p>Is as the very center of the Earth,</p>

<p>Drawing all things to it. I’ll go in and weep–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>  Do, do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cressida</span></p>

<p>Tear my bright hair, and scratch my praised cheeks,</p>

<p>Crack my clear voice with sobs, and break my heart</p>

<p>With sounding “Troilus.” I will not go from Troy.</p>
