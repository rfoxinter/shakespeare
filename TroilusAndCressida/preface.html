<p>A never writer to an ever reader: news.</p>

<br/>

<p>Eternal reader, you have here a new play, never staled</p>

<p>with the stage, never clapperclawed with the palms of</p>

<p>the vulgar, and yet passing full of the palm comical, for</p>

<p>it is a birth of your brain that never undertook anything</p>

<p>comical vainly. And were but the vain names of comedies</p>

<p>changed for the titles of commodities, or of plays</p>

<p>for pleas, you should see all those grand censors, that</p>

<p>now style them such vanities, flock to them for the</p>

<p>main grace of their gravities, especially this author’s</p>

<p>comedies, that are so framed to the life that they serve</p>

<p>for the most common commentaries of all the actions</p>

<p>of our lives, showing such a dexterity and power of wit</p>

<p>that the most displeased with plays are pleased with</p>

<p>his comedies. And all such dull and heavy-witted</p>

<p>worldlings as were never capable of the wit of a comedy,</p>

<p>coming by report of them to his representations,</p>

<p>have found that wit there that they never found in</p>

<p>themselves and have parted better witted than they</p>

<p>came, feeling an edge of wit set upon them more than</p>

<p>ever they dreamed they had brain to grind it on. So</p>

<p>much and such savored salt of wit is in his comedies</p>

<p>that they seem, for their height of pleasure, to be born</p>

<p>in that sea that brought forth Venus. Amongst all there</p>

<p>is none more witty than this; and had I time, I would</p>

<p>comment upon it, though I know it needs not, for so</p>

<p>much as will make you think your testern well</p>

<p>bestowed, but for so much worth as even poor I know</p>

<p>to be stuffed in it. It deserves such a labor as well as the</p>

<p>best comedy in Terence or Plautus. And believe this,</p>

<p>that when he is gone and his comedies out of sale, you</p>

<p>will scramble for them and set up a new English</p>

<p>Inquisition. Take this for a warning, and at the peril of</p>

<p>your pleasure’s loss, and judgment’s, refuse not nor like</p>

<p>this the less for not being sullied with the smoky breath</p>

<p>of the multitude, but thank fortune for the scape it</p>

<p>hath made amongst you, since by the grand possessors’</p>

<p>wills I believe you should have prayed for them rather</p>

<p>than been prayed. And so I leave all such to be prayed</p>

<p>for, for the states of their wits’ healths, that will not</p>

<p>praise it. Vale.</p>
