<p><center><i>[Enter Ajax and Thersites.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Thersites!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Agamemnon–how if he had boils, full, all</p>

<p>over, generally?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Thersites!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  And those boils did run? Say so. Did not the</p>

<p>general run, then? Were not that a botchy core?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Dog!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Then there would come some matter</p>

<p>from him. I see none now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Thou bitchwolf’s son, canst thou not hear? Feel,</p>

<p>then.     <i><i>[Strikes him.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel</p>

<p>beef-witted lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Speak, then, thou unsalted leaven, speak. I will</p>

<p>beat thee into handsomeness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness,</p>

<p>but I think thy horse will sooner con an oration</p>

<p>than thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst</p>

<p>strike, canst thou? A red murrain o’ thy jade’s tricks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest</p>

<p>me thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  The proclamation!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Do not, porpentine, do not. My fingers itch.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  I would thou didst itch from head to foot,</p>

<p>and I had the scratching of thee; I would make</p>

<p>thee the loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou</p>

<p>art forth in the incursions, thou strikest as slow as</p>

<p>another.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  I say, the proclamation!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Thou grumblest and railest every hour on</p>

<p>Achilles, and thou art as full of envy at his greatness</p>

<p>as Cerberus is at Proserpina’s beauty, ay, that</p>

<p>thou bark’st at him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Mistress Thersites!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Thou shouldst strike him–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Cobloaf!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  He would pound thee into shivers with his</p>

<p>fist as a sailor breaks a biscuit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  You whoreson cur!     <i><i>[Strikes him.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Do, do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Thou stool for a witch!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Ay, do, do, thou sodden-witted lord. Thou</p>

<p>hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows; an</p>

<p>asinego may tutor thee, thou scurvy-valiant ass.</p>

<p>Thou art here but to thrash Trojans, and thou art</p>

<p>bought and sold among those of any wit, like a</p>

<p>barbarian slave. If thou use to beat me, I will begin</p>

<p>at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches, thou</p>

<p>thing of no bowels, thou.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  You dog!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  You scurvy lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  You cur!     <i><i>[Strikes him.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Mars his idiot! Do, rudeness, do, camel, do,</p>

<p>do.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Achilles and Patroclus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Why, how now, Ajax? Wherefore do you</p>

<p>thus?–How now, Thersites? What’s the matter,</p>

<p>man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  You see him there, do you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Ay, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Nay, look upon him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  So I do. What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Nay, but regard him well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Well, why, so I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  But yet you look not well upon him, for</p>

<p>whosomever you take him to be, he is Ajax.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  I know that, fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Ay, but that fool knows not himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Therefore I beat thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters!</p>

<p>His evasions have ears thus long. I have</p>

<p>bobbed his brain more than he has beat my bones.</p>

<p>I will buy nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia</p>

<p>mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow.</p>

<p>This lord, Achilles–Ajax, who wears his wit in his</p>

<p>belly, and his guts in his head–I’ll tell you what I</p>

<p>say of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  What?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  I say, this Ajax–     <i><i>[Ajax menaces him.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Nay, good Ajax.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Has not so much wit–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc> <i>[to Ajax]</i>  Nay, I must hold you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  As will stop the eye of Helen’s needle, for</p>

<p>whom he comes to fight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Peace, fool!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  I would have peace and quietness, but the</p>

<p>fool will not–he there, that he. Look you there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  O, thou damned cur, I shall–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Will you set your wit to a fool’s?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  No, I warrant you. The fool’s will shame it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  Good words, Thersites.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc> <i>[to Ajax]</i>  What’s the quarrel?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the</p>

<p>proclamation, and he rails upon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  I serve thee not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Well, go to, go to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  I serve here voluntary.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  Your last service was suff’rance; ’twas not</p>

<p>voluntary. No man is beaten voluntary. Ajax was</p>

<p>here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  E’en so. A great deal of your wit, too, lies in</p>

<p>your sinews, or else there be liars. Hector shall</p>

<p>have a great catch an he knock out either of</p>

<p>your brains; he were as good crack a fusty nut with</p>

<p>no kernel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  What, with me too, Thersites?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  There’s Ulysses and old Nestor–whose wit</p>

<p>was moldy ere your grandsires had nails on</p>

<p>their toes–yoke you like draft-oxen and make</p>

<p>you plow up the wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  What? What?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  Yes, good sooth. To, Achilles! To, Ajax! To–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  I shall cut out your tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  ’Tis no matter. I shall speak as much as</p>

<p>thou afterwards.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  No more words, Thersites. Peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  I will hold my peace when Achilles’ brach</p>

<p>bids me, shall I?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc>  There’s for you, Patroclus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Thersites</sc>  I will see you hanged like clodpolls ere I</p>

<p>come any more to your tents. I will keep where</p>

<p>there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Patroclus</sc>  A good riddance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc> <i>[to Ajax]</i></p>

<p>Marry, this, sir, is proclaimed through all our host:</p>

<p>That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,</p>

<p>Will with a trumpet ’twixt our tents and Troy</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning call some knight to arms</p>

<p>That hath a stomach, and such a one that dare</p>

<p>Maintain–I know not what; ’tis trash. Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  Farewell. Who shall answer him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Achilles</sc></p>

<p>I know not. ’Tis put to lott’ry. Otherwise,</p>

<p>He knew his man.     <i><i>[Achilles and Patroclus exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ajax</sc>  O, meaning you? I will go learn more of it.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
