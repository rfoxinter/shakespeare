<p><center><i>[Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Philostrate, Lords, and</p>

<p>Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc></p>

<p>’Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>More strange than true. I never may believe</p>

<p>These antique fables nor these fairy toys.</p>

<p>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,</p>

<p>Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend</p>

<p>More than cool reason ever comprehends.</p>

<p>The lunatic, the lover, and the poet</p>

<p>Are of imagination all compact.</p>

<p>One sees more devils than vast hell can hold:</p>

<p>That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,</p>

<p>Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt.</p>

<p>The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,</p>

<p>Doth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth to</p>

<p>heaven,</p>

<p>And as imagination bodies forth</p>

<p>The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen</p>

<p>Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing</p>

<p>A local habitation and a name.</p>

<p>Such tricks hath strong imagination</p>

<p>That, if it would but apprehend some joy,</p>

<p>It comprehends some bringer of that joy.</p>

<p>Or in the night, imagining some fear,</p>

<p>How easy is a bush supposed a bear!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc></p>

<p>But all the story of the night told over,</p>

<p>And all their minds transfigured so together,</p>

<p>More witnesseth than fancy’s images</p>

<p>And grows to something of great constancy,</p>

<p>But, howsoever, strange and admirable.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lovers: Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth.–</p>

<p>Joy, gentle friends! Joy and fresh days of love</p>

<p>Accompany your hearts!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  More than to us</p>

<p>Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Come now, what masques, what dances shall we</p>

<p>have</p>

<p>To wear away this long age of three hours</p>

<p>Between our after-supper and bedtime?</p>

<p>Where is our usual manager of mirth?</p>

<p>What revels are in hand? Is there no play</p>

<p>To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?</p>

<p>Call Philostrate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Philostrate</sc> <i>[coming forward]</i>  Here, mighty Theseus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Say what abridgment have you for this evening,</p>

<p>What masque, what music? How shall we beguile</p>

<p>The lazy time if not with some delight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Philostrate</sc> <i>[giving Theseus a paper]</i></p>

<p>There is a brief how many sports are ripe.</p>

<p>Make choice of which your Highness will see first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>“The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung</p>

<p>By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.”</p>

<p>We’ll none of that. That have I told my love</p>

<p>In glory of my kinsman Hercules.</p>

<p>“The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,</p>

<p>Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.”</p>

<p>That is an old device, and it was played</p>

<p>When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.</p>

<p>“The thrice-three Muses mourning for the death</p>

<p>Of learning, late deceased in beggary.”</p>

<p>That is some satire, keen and critical,</p>

<p>Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.</p>

<p>“A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus</p>

<p>And his love Thisbe, very tragical mirth.”</p>

<p>“Merry” and “tragical”? “Tedious” and “brief”?</p>

<p>That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow!</p>

<p>How shall we find the concord of this discord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Philostrate</sc></p>

<p>A play there is, my lord, some ten words long</p>

<p>(Which is as brief as I have known a play),</p>

<p>But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,</p>

<p>Which makes it tedious; for in all the play,</p>

<p>There is not one word apt, one player fitted.</p>

<p>And tragical, my noble lord, it is.</p>

<p>For Pyramus therein doth kill himself,</p>

<p>Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,</p>

<p>Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears</p>

<p>The passion of loud laughter never shed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>What are they that do play it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Philostrate</sc></p>

<p>Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,</p>

<p>Which never labored in their minds till now,</p>

<p>And now have toiled their unbreathed memories</p>

<p>With this same play, against your nuptial.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>And we will hear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Philostrate</sc>  No, my noble lord,</p>

<p>It is not for you. I have heard it over,</p>

<p>And it is nothing, nothing in the world,</p>

<p>Unless you can find sport in their intents,</p>

<p>Extremely stretched and conned with cruel pain</p>

<p>To do you service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  I will hear that play,</p>

<p>For never anything can be amiss</p>

<p>When simpleness and duty tender it.</p>

<p>Go, bring them in–and take your places, ladies.</p>

<p><center><i>[Philostrate exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc></p>

<p>I love not to see wretchedness o’ercharged,</p>

<p>And duty in his service perishing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc></p>

<p>He says they can do nothing in this kind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.</p>

<p>Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;</p>

<p>And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect</p>

<p>Takes it in might, not merit.</p>

<p>Where I have come, great clerks have purposed</p>

<p>To greet me with premeditated welcomes,</p>

<p>Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,</p>

<p>Make periods in the midst of sentences,</p>

<p>Throttle their practiced accent in their fears,</p>

<p>And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,</p>

<p>Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,</p>

<p>Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome,</p>

<p>And in the modesty of fearful duty,</p>

<p>I read as much as from the rattling tongue</p>

<p>Of saucy and audacious eloquence.</p>

<p>Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity</p>

<p>In least speak most, to my capacity.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Philostrate.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Philostrate</sc></p>

<p>So please your Grace, the Prologue is addressed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  Let him approach.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Prologue.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prologue</sc></p>

<p>If we offend, it is with our goodwill.</p>

<p>   <i>That you should think we come not to offend,</i></p>

<p>But with goodwill. To show our simple skill,</p>

<p>   <i>That is the true beginning of our end.</i></p>

<p>Consider, then, we come but in despite.</p>

<p>   <i>We do not come, as minding to content you,</i></p>

<p>Our true intent is. All for your delight</p>

<p>   <i>We are not here. That you should here repent</i></p>

<p>   <i>you,</i></p>

<p>The actors are at hand, and, by their show,</p>

<p>You shall know all that you are like to know.</p>

<p><center><i>[Prologue exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  This fellow doth not stand upon points.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt;</p>

<p>he knows not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is</p>

<p>not enough to speak, but to speak true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc>  Indeed he hath played on this prologue like</p>

<p>a child on a recorder–a sound, but not in</p>

<p>government.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  His speech was like a tangled chain–nothing</p>

<p>impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pyramus (Bottom), and Thisbe (Flute), and</p>

<p>Wall (Snout), and Moonshine (Starveling), and Lion</p>

<p>(Snug), and Prologue (Quince).]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc> <i>[as Prologue]</i></p>

<p>Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show.</p>

<p>   <i>But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.</i></p>

<p>This man is Pyramus, if you would know.</p>

<p>   <i>This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.</i></p>

<p>This man with lime and roughcast doth present</p>

<p>   <i>“Wall,” that vile wall which did these lovers</i></p>

<p>   <i>sunder;</i></p>

<p>And through Wall’s chink, poor souls, they are</p>

<p>content</p>

<p>   <i>To whisper, at the which let no man wonder.</i></p>

<p>This man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn,</p>

<p>   <i>Presenteth “Moonshine,” for, if you will know,</i></p>

<p>By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn</p>

<p>   <i>To meet at Ninus’ tomb, there, there to woo.</i></p>

<p>This grisly beast (which “Lion” hight by name)</p>

<p>   <i>The trusty Thisbe coming first by night</i></p>

<p>Did scare away or rather did affright;</p>

<p>And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,</p>

<p>   <i>Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.</i></p>

<p>Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,</p>

<p>   <i>And finds his trusty Thisbe’s mantle slain.</i></p>

<p>Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,</p>

<p>   <i>He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast.</i></p>

<p>And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,</p>

<p>   <i>His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,</i></p>

<p>Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain</p>

<p>At large discourse, while here they do remain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  I wonder if the lion be to speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  No wonder, my lord. One lion may when</p>

<p>many asses do.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lion, Thisbe, Moonshine, and Prologue exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snout</sc> <i>[as Wall]</i></p>

<p>In this same interlude it doth befall</p>

<p>That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;</p>

<p>And such a wall as I would have you think</p>

<p>That had in it a crannied hole or chink,</p>

<p>Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,</p>

<p>Did whisper often, very secretly.</p>

<p>This loam, this roughcast, and this stone doth show</p>

<p>That I am that same wall. The truth is so.</p>

<p>And this the cranny is, right and sinister,</p>

<p>Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  Would you desire lime and hair to speak</p>

<p>better?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard</p>

<p>discourse, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  Pyramus draws near the wall. Silence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc> <i>[as Pyramus]</i></p>

<p>O grim-looked night! O night with hue so black!</p>

<p>   <i>O night, which ever art when day is not!</i></p>

<p>O night! O night! Alack, alack, alack!</p>

<p>   <i>I fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot.</i></p>

<p>And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,</p>

<p>   <i>That stand’st between her father’s ground and</i></p>

<p>   <i>mine,</i></p>

<p>Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,</p>

<p>   <i>Show me thy chink to blink through with mine</i></p>

<p>   <i>eyne.</i></p>

<p>Thanks, courteous wall. Jove shield thee well for</p>

<p>this.</p>

<p>   <i>But what see I? No Thisbe do I see.</i></p>

<p>O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,</p>

<p>   <i>Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  The wall, methinks, being sensible, should</p>

<p>curse again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  No, in truth, sir, he should not. “Deceiving</p>

<p>me” is Thisbe’s cue. She is to enter now, and I am</p>

<p>to spy her through the wall. You shall see it will fall</p>

<p>pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Thisbe (Flute).]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc> <i>[as Thisbe]</i></p>

<p>O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans</p>

<p>   <i>For parting my fair Pyramus and me.</i></p>

<p>My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones,</p>

<p>   <i>Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc> <i>[as Pyramus]</i></p>

<p>I see a voice! Now will I to the chink</p>

<p>   <i>To spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face.</i></p>

<p>Thisbe?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc> <i>[as Thisbe]</i></p>

<p>My love! Thou art my love, I think.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc> <i>[as Pyramus]</i></p>

<p>   <i>Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace,</i></p>

<p>And, like Limander, am I trusty still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc> <i>[as Thisbe]</i></p>

<p>And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc> <i>[as Pyramus]</i></p>

<p>Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc> <i>[as Thisbe]</i></p>

<p>As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc> <i>[as Pyramus]</i></p>

<p>O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc> <i>[as Thisbe]</i></p>

<p>I kiss the wall’s hole, not your lips at all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc> <i>[as Pyramus]</i></p>

<p>Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc> <i>[as Thisbe]</i></p>

<p>’Tide life, ’tide death, I come without delay.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bottom and Flute exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snout</sc> <i>[as Wall]</i></p>

<p>Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so,</p>

<p>And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  Now is the wall down between the two</p>

<p>neighbors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  No remedy, my lord, when walls are so</p>

<p>willful to hear without warning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc>  This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  The best in this kind are but shadows, and</p>

<p>the worst are no worse, if imagination amend</p>

<p>them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc>  It must be your imagination, then, and not</p>

<p>theirs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  If we imagine no worse of them than they of</p>

<p>themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here</p>

<p>come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lion (Snug) and Moonshine (Starveling).]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snug</sc> <i>[as Lion]</i></p>

<p>You ladies, you whose gentle hearts do fear</p>

<p>   <i>The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on</i></p>

<p>   <i>floor,</i></p>

<p>May now perchance both quake and tremble here,</p>

<p>   <i>When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.</i></p>

<p>Then know that I, as Snug the joiner, am</p>

<p>A lion fell, nor else no lion’s dam;</p>

<p>For if I should as lion come in strife</p>

<p>Into this place, ’twere pity on my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  A very gentle beast, and of a good</p>

<p>conscience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  The very best at a beast, my lord, that e’er I</p>

<p>saw.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  This lion is a very fox for his valor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  True, and a goose for his discretion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  Not so, my lord, for his valor cannot carry</p>

<p>his discretion, and the fox carries the goose.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his</p>

<p>valor, for the goose carries not the fox. It is well.</p>

<p>Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the</p>

<p>Moon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Starveling</sc> <i>[as Moonshine]</i></p>

<p>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  He should have worn the horns on his</p>

<p>head.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible</p>

<p>within the circumference.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Starveling</sc> <i>[as Moonshine]</i></p>

<p>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present.</p>

<p>Myself the man i’ th’ moon do seem to be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  This is the greatest error of all the rest; the</p>

<p>man should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else</p>

<p>“the man i’ th’ moon”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  He dares not come there for the candle,</p>

<p>for you see, it is already in snuff.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc>  I am aweary of this moon. Would he would</p>

<p>change.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  It appears by his small light of discretion that</p>

<p>he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason,</p>

<p>we must stay the time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  Proceed, Moon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Starveling</sc> <i>[as Moonshine]</i>   <i>All that I have to say is to tell</i></p>

<p>you that the lanthorn is the moon, I the man i’ th’</p>

<p>moon, this thornbush my thornbush, and this dog</p>

<p>my dog.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  Why, all these should be in the lanthorn,</p>

<p>for all these are in the moon. But silence. Here</p>

<p>comes Thisbe.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Thisbe (Flute).]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc> <i>[as Thisbe]</i></p>

<p>This is old Ninny’s tomb. Where is my love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snug</sc> <i>[as Lion]</i>  O!</p>

<p><center><i>[The Lion roars. Thisbe runs off,</p>

<p>dropping her mantle.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  Well roared, Lion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  Well run, Thisbe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc>  Well shone, Moon. Truly, the Moon shines</p>

<p>with a good grace.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lion worries the mantle.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  Well moused, Lion.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Pyramus (Bottom).]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  And then came Pyramus.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lion exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  And so the lion vanished.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc> <i>[as Pyramus]</i></p>

<p>Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams.</p>

<p>   <i>I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright,</i></p>

<p>For by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,</p>

<p>   <i>I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.–</i></p>

<p>      <i>But stay! O spite!</i></p>

<p>      <i>But mark, poor knight,</i></p>

<p>   <i>What dreadful dole is here!</i></p>

<p>      <i>Eyes, do you see!</i></p>

<p>      <i>How can it be!</i></p>

<p>   <i>O dainty duck! O dear!</i></p>

<p>      <i>Thy mantle good–</i></p>

<p>      <i>What, stained with blood?</i></p>

<p>   <i>Approach, ye Furies fell!</i></p>

<p>      <i>O Fates, come, come,</i></p>

<p>      <i>Cut thread and thrum,</i></p>

<p>   <i>Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  This passion, and the death of a dear friend,</p>

<p>would go near to make a man look sad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc>  Beshrew my heart but I pity the man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc> <i>[as Pyramus]</i></p>

<p>O, wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame,</p>

<p>   <i>Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear,</i></p>

<p>Which is–no, no–which was the fairest dame</p>

<p>   <i>That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with</i></p>

<p>   <i>cheer?</i></p>

<p>      <i>Come, tears, confound!</i></p>

<p>      <i>Out, sword, and wound</i></p>

<p>   <i>The pap of Pyramus;</i></p>

<p>      <i>Ay, that left pap,</i></p>

<p>      Where heart doth hop.     <i><i>[Pyramus stabs himself.]</i></i></p>

<p>   <i>Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.</i></p>

<p>      <i>Now am I dead;</i></p>

<p>      <i>Now am I fled;</i></p>

<p>   <i>My soul is in the sky.</i></p>

<p>      <i>Tongue, lose thy light!</i></p>

<p>      Moon, take thy flight!     <i><i>[Moonshine exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>   Now die, die, die, die, die.     <i><i>[Pyramus falls.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  No die, but an ace for him, for he is but</p>

<p>one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  Less than an ace, man, for he is dead, he is</p>

<p>nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  With the help of a surgeon he might yet</p>

<p>recover and yet prove an ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc>  How chance Moonshine is gone before</p>

<p>Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  She will find him by starlight.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Thisbe (Flute).]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here she comes, and her passion ends the play.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc>  Methinks she should not use a long one for</p>

<p>such a Pyramus. I hope she will be brief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus,</p>

<p>which Thisbe, is the better: he for a man, God</p>

<p>warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  She hath spied him already with those</p>

<p>sweet eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  And thus she means, videlicet–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc> <i>[as Thisbe]</i></p>

<p>           <i>Asleep, my love?</i></p>

<p>           <i>What, dead, my dove?</i></p>

<p>        <i>O Pyramus, arise!</i></p>

<p>           <i>Speak, speak. Quite dumb?</i></p>

<p>           <i>Dead? Dead? A tomb</i></p>

<p>        <i>Must cover thy sweet eyes.</i></p>

<p>           <i>These lily lips,</i></p>

<p>           <i>This cherry nose,</i></p>

<p>        <i>These yellow cowslip cheeks</i></p>

<p>           <i>Are gone, are gone!</i></p>

<p>           <i>Lovers, make moan;</i></p>

<p>        <i>His eyes were green as leeks.</i></p>

<p>           <i>O Sisters Three,</i></p>

<p>           <i>Come, come to me</i></p>

<p>        <i>With hands as pale as milk.</i></p>

<p>           <i>Lay them in gore,</i></p>

<p>           <i>Since you have shore</i></p>

<p>        <i>With shears his thread of silk.</i></p>

<p>           <i>Tongue, not a word!</i></p>

<p>           <i>Come, trusty sword,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Come, blade, my breast imbrue!</i></p>

<p><center><i>[Thisbe stabs herself.]</i></center></p>

<p>           <i>And farewell, friends.</i></p>

<p>           <i>Thus Thisbe ends.</i></p>

<p>        Adieu, adieu, adieu.     <i><i>[Thisbe falls.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the</p>

<p>dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  Ay, and Wall too.</p>

<p><center><i>[Bottom and Flute arise.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  No, I assure you, the wall is down that</p>

<p>parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the</p>

<p>Epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between</p>

<p>two of our company?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  No epilogue, I pray you. For your play needs</p>

<p>no excuse. Never excuse. For when the players are</p>

<p>all dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if</p>

<p>he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged</p>

<p>himself in Thisbe’s garter, it would have been a fine</p>

<p>tragedy; and so it is, truly, and very notably discharged.</p>

<p>But, come, your Bergomask. Let your</p>

<p>epilogue alone.</p>

<p><center><i>[Dance, and the players exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.</p>

<p>Lovers, to bed! ’Tis almost fairy time.</p>

<p>I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn</p>

<p>As much as we this night have overwatched.</p>

<p>This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled</p>

<p>The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.</p>

<p>A fortnight hold we this solemnity</p>

<p>In nightly revels and new jollity.     <i><i>[They exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robin Goodfellow.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Now the hungry lion roars,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And the wolf behowls the moon,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Whilst the heavy plowman snores,</i></p>

<p>        <i>All with weary task fordone.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Now the wasted brands do glow,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Puts the wretch that lies in woe</i></p>

<p>        <i>In remembrance of a shroud.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Now it is the time of night</i></p>

<p>        <i>That the graves, all gaping wide,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Every one lets forth his sprite</i></p>

<p>        <i>In the church-way paths to glide.</i></p>

<p>     <i>And we fairies, that do run</i></p>

<p>        <i>By the triple Hecate’s team</i></p>

<p>     <i>From the presence of the sun,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Following darkness like a dream,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Now are frolic. Not a mouse</i></p>

<p>     <i>Shall disturb this hallowed house.</i></p>

<p>     <i>I am sent with broom before,</i></p>

<p>     <i>To sweep the dust behind the door.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Oberon and Titania, King and Queen of Fairies,</p>

<p>with all their train.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Through the house give glimmering light,</i></p>

<p>        <i>By the dead and drowsy fire.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Every elf and fairy sprite,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Hop as light as bird from brier,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And this ditty after me,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Sing and dance it trippingly.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titania</sc></p>

<p>     <i>First rehearse your song by rote,</i></p>

<p>     <i>To each word a warbling note.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Hand in hand, with fairy grace,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Will we sing and bless this place.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[Oberon leads the Fairies in song and dance.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Now, until the break of day,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Through this house each fairy stray.</i></p>

<p>     <i>To the best bride-bed will we,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Which by us shall blessed be,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And the issue there create</i></p>

<p>     <i>Ever shall be fortunate.</i></p>

<p>     <i>So shall all the couples three</i></p>

<p>     <i>Ever true in loving be,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And the blots of Nature’s hand</i></p>

<p>     <i>Shall not in their issue stand.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Never mole, harelip, nor scar,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Nor mark prodigious, such as are</i></p>

<p>     <i>Despised in nativity,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Shall upon their children be.</i></p>

<p>     <i>With this field-dew consecrate</i></p>

<p>     <i>Every fairy take his gait,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And each several chamber bless,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Through this palace, with sweet peace.</i></p>

<p>     <i>And the owner of it blest,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Ever shall in safety rest.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Trip away. Make no stay.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Meet me all by break of day.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[All but Robin exit.]</i></center></p>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>     <i>If we shadows have offended,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Think but this and all is mended:</i></p>

<p>     <i>That you have but slumbered here</i></p>

<p>     <i>While these visions did appear.</i></p>

<p>     <i>And this weak and idle theme,</i></p>

<p>     <i>No more yielding but a dream,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Gentles, do not reprehend.</i></p>

<p>     <i>If you pardon, we will mend.</i></p>

<p>     <i>And, as I am an honest Puck,</i></p>

<p>     <i>If we have unearned luck</i></p>

<p>     <i>Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,</i></p>

<p>     <i>We will make amends ere long.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Else the Puck a liar call.</i></p>

<p>     <i>So good night unto you all.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Give me your hands, if we be friends,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And Robin shall restore amends.</i></p>
