<p><center><i>[With Titania still asleep onstage, enter the Clowns,</p>

<p>Bottom, Quince, Snout, Starveling, Snug, and Flute.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Are we all met?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Pat, pat. And here’s a marvels convenient</p>

<p>place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be</p>

<p>our stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house,</p>

<p>and we will do it in action as we will do it before</p>

<p>the Duke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Peter Quince?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  What sayest thou, bully Bottom?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  There are things in this comedy of Pyramus</p>

<p>and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus</p>

<p>must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies</p>

<p>cannot abide. How answer you that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snout</sc>  By ’r lakin, a parlous fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Starveling</sc>  I believe we must leave the killing out,</p>

<p>when all is done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Not a whit! I have a device to make all well.</p>

<p>Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to</p>

<p>say we will do no harm with our swords and that</p>

<p>Pyramus is not killed indeed. And, for the more</p>

<p>better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not</p>

<p>Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them</p>

<p>out of fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Well, we will have such a prologue, and it shall</p>

<p>be written in eight and six.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  No, make it two more. Let it be written in</p>

<p>eight and eight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snout</sc>  Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Starveling</sc>  I fear it, I promise you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Masters, you ought to consider with yourself,</p>

<p>to bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies is a</p>

<p>most dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful</p>

<p>wildfowl than your lion living, and we ought to look</p>

<p>to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snout</sc>  Therefore another prologue must tell he is not</p>

<p>a lion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Nay, you must name his name, and half his</p>

<p>face must be seen through the lion’s neck, and he</p>

<p>himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the</p>

<p>same defect: “Ladies,” or “Fair ladies, I would</p>

<p>wish you,” or “I would request you,” or “I would</p>

<p>entreat you not to fear, not to tremble! My life for</p>

<p>yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were</p>

<p>pity of my life. No, I am no such thing. I am a man as</p>

<p>other men are.” And there indeed let him name his</p>

<p>name and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard</p>

<p>things: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber,</p>

<p>for you know Pyramus and Thisbe meet by</p>

<p>moonlight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snout</sc>  Doth the moon shine that night we play our</p>

<p>play?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac.</p>

<p>Find out moonshine, find out moonshine.</p>

<p><center><i>[Quince takes out a book.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Yes, it doth shine that night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Why, then, may you leave a casement of the</p>

<p>great chamber window, where we play, open, and</p>

<p>the moon may shine in at the casement.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Ay, or else one must come in with a bush of</p>

<p>thorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigure</p>

<p>or to present the person of Moonshine. Then there</p>

<p>is another thing: we must have a wall in the great</p>

<p>chamber, for Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story,</p>

<p>did talk through the chink of a wall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snout</sc>  You can never bring in a wall. What say you,</p>

<p>Bottom?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Some man or other must present Wall. And</p>

<p>let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some</p>

<p>roughcast about him to signify wall, or let him</p>

<p>hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall</p>

<p>Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,</p>

<p>every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus,</p>

<p>you begin. When you have spoken your</p>

<p>speech, enter into that brake, and so everyone</p>

<p>according to his cue.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robin invisible to those onstage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>What hempen homespuns have we swagg’ring here</p>

<p>So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?</p>

<p>What, a play toward? I’ll be an auditor–</p>

<p>An actor too perhaps, if I see cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Speak, Pyramus.–Thisbe, stand forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc> <i>[as Pyramus]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Thisbe, the flowers of odious savors sweet–</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Odors, odors!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc> <i>[as Pyramus]</i></p>

<p>          <i>...odors savors sweet.</i></p>

<p>     <i>So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.–</i></p>

<p>     <i>But hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile,</i></p>

<p>     And by and by I will to thee appear.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>A stranger Pyramus than e’er played here.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc>  Must I speak now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Ay, marry, must you, for you must understand</p>

<p>he goes but to see a noise that he heard and is to</p>

<p>come again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc> <i>[as Thisbe]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Of color like the red rose on triumphant brier,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,</i></p>

<p>     <i>As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire.</i></p>

<p>     <i>I’ll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny’s tomb.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  “Ninus’ tomb,” man! Why, you must not</p>

<p>speak that yet. That you answer to Pyramus. You</p>

<p>speak all your part at once, cues and all.–Pyramus,</p>

<p>enter. Your cue is past. It is “never tire.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc>  O!</p>

<p><i>[As Thisbe.]</i> As true as truest horse, that yet would never</p>

<p>tire.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robin, and Bottom as Pyramus with the</p>

<p>ass-head.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc> <i>[as Pyramus]</i></p>

<p>     <i>If I were fair, fair Thisbe, I were only thine.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray,</p>

<p>masters, fly, masters! Help!</p>

<p><center><i>[Quince, Flute, Snout, Snug, and Starveling exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>I’ll follow you. I’ll lead you about a round,</p>

<p>   <i>Through bog, through bush, through brake,</i></p>

<p>   <i>through brier.</i></p>

<p>Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound,</p>

<p>   <i>A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire,</i></p>

<p>And neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn,</p>

<p>Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Why do they run away? This is a knavery of</p>

<p>them to make me afeard.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Snout.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snout</sc>  O Bottom, thou art changed! What do I see on</p>

<p>thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  What do you see? You see an ass-head of your</p>

<p>own, do you?     <i><i>[Snout exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Quince.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee! Thou art</p>

<p>translated!     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  I see their knavery. This is to make an ass of</p>

<p>me, to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir</p>

<p>from this place, do what they can. I will walk up</p>

<p>and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear</p>

<p>I am not afraid.</p>

<p><i>[He sings.]</i>     <i>The ouzel cock, so black of hue,</i></p>

<p>        <i>With orange-tawny bill,</i></p>

<p>     <i>The throstle with his note so true,</i></p>

<p>        <i>The wren with little quill–</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titania</sc> <i>[waking up]</i></p>

<p>What angel wakes me from my flow’ry bed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>The finch, the sparrow, and the lark,</i></p>

<p>        <i>The plainsong cuckoo gray,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Whose note full many a man doth mark</i></p>

<p>        <i>And dares not answer “nay”–</i></p>

<p>for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a</p>

<p>bird? Who would give a bird the lie though he cry</p>

<p>“cuckoo” never so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titania</sc></p>

<p>I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.</p>

<p>Mine ear is much enamored of thy note,</p>

<p>So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape,</p>

<p>And thy fair virtue’s force perforce doth move me</p>

<p>On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Methinks, mistress, you should have little</p>

<p>reason for that. And yet, to say the truth, reason</p>

<p>and love keep little company together nowadays.</p>

<p>The more the pity that some honest neighbors will</p>

<p>not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon</p>

<p>occasion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titania</sc></p>

<p>Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Not so neither; but if I had wit enough to get</p>

<p>out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own</p>

<p>turn.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titania</sc></p>

<p>Out of this wood do not desire to go.</p>

<p>Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.</p>

<p>I am a spirit of no common rate.</p>

<p>The summer still doth tend upon my state,</p>

<p>And I do love thee. Therefore go with me.</p>

<p>I’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee,</p>

<p>And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep</p>

<p>And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep.</p>

<p>And I will purge thy mortal grossness so</p>

<p>That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.–</p>

<p>Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Mote, and Mustardseed!</p>

<p><center><i>[Enter four Fairies: Peaseblossom, Cobweb,</p>

<p>Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.</p>

<p>Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;</p>

<p>Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,</p>

<p>With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;</p>

<p>The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,</p>

<p>And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs</p>

<p>And light them at the fiery glowworms’ eyes</p>

<p>To have my love to bed and to arise;</p>

<p>And pluck the wings from painted butterflies</p>

<p>To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.</p>

<p>Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.</p>

<p>well. That same cowardly, giantlike ox-beef</p>

<p>hath devoured many a gentleman of your house. I</p>

<p>promise you, your kindred hath made my eyes</p>

<p>water ere now. I desire you of more acquaintance,</p>

<p>good Master Mustardseed.</p>

<p>Come, wait upon him. Lead him to my bower.</p>

<p>   <i>The moon, methinks, looks with a wat’ry eye,</i></p>
