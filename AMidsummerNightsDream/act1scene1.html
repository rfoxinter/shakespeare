<p><center><i>[Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Philostrate, with others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</p>

<p>Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in</p>

<p>Another moon. But, O, methinks how slow</p>

<p>This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires</p>

<p>Like to a stepdame or a dowager</p>

<p>Long withering out a young man’s revenue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hippolyta</sc></p>

<p>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;</p>

<p>Four nights will quickly dream away the time;</p>

<p>And then the moon, like to a silver bow</p>

<p>New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night</p>

<p>Of our solemnities.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  Go, Philostrate,</p>

<p>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments.</p>

<p>Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.</p>

<p>Turn melancholy forth to funerals;</p>

<p>The pale companion is not for our pomp.</p>

<p><center><i>[Philostrate exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword</p>

<p>And won thy love doing thee injuries,</p>

<p>But I will wed thee in another key,</p>

<p>With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, and Lysander </p>

<p> and Demetrius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeus</sc></p>

<p>Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeus</sc></p>

<p>Full of vexation come I, with complaint</p>

<p>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.–</p>

<p>Stand forth, Demetrius.–My noble lord,</p>

<p>This man hath my consent to marry her.–</p>

<p>Stand forth, Lysander.–And, my gracious duke,</p>

<p>This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.–</p>

<p>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes</p>

<p>And interchanged love tokens with my child.</p>

<p>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung</p>

<p>With feigning voice verses of feigning love</p>

<p>And stol’n the impression of her fantasy</p>

<p>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,</p>

<p>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats–messengers</p>

<p>Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.</p>

<p>With cunning hast thou filched my daughter’s heart,</p>

<p>Turned her obedience (which is due to me)</p>

<p>To stubborn harshness.–And, my gracious duke,</p>

<p>Be it so she will not here before your Grace</p>

<p>Consent to marry with Demetrius,</p>

<p>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:</p>

<p>As she is mine, I may dispose of her,</p>

<p>Which shall be either to this gentleman</p>

<p>Or to her death, according to our law</p>

<p>Immediately provided in that case.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>What say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid.</p>

<p>To you, your father should be as a god,</p>

<p>One that composed your beauties, yea, and one</p>

<p>To whom you are but as a form in wax</p>

<p>By him imprinted, and within his power</p>

<p>To leave the figure or disfigure it.</p>

<p>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>So is Lysander.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc>  In himself he is,</p>

<p>But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,</p>

<p>The other must be held the worthier.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>I would my father looked but with my eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.</p>

<p>I know not by what power I am made bold,</p>

<p>Nor how it may concern my modesty</p>

<p>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;</p>

<p>But I beseech your Grace that I may know</p>

<p>The worst that may befall me in this case</p>

<p>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Either to die the death or to abjure</p>

<p>Forever the society of men.</p>

<p>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,</p>

<p>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</p>

<p>Whether (if you yield not to your father’s choice)</p>

<p>You can endure the livery of a nun,</p>

<p>For aye to be in shady cloister mewed,</p>

<p>To live a barren sister all your life,</p>

<p>Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</p>

<p>Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood</p>

<p>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,</p>

<p>But earthlier happy is the rose distilled</p>

<p>Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,</p>

<p>Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</p>

<p>Ere I will yield my virgin patent up</p>

<p>Unto his Lordship whose unwished yoke</p>

<p>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>Take time to pause, and by the next new moon</p>

<p>(The sealing day betwixt my love and me</p>

<p>For everlasting bond of fellowship),</p>

<p>Upon that day either prepare to die</p>

<p>For disobedience to your father’s will,</p>

<p>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,</p>

<p>Or on Diana’s altar to protest</p>

<p>For aye austerity and single life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield</p>

<p>Thy crazed title to my certain right.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>You have her father’s love, Demetrius.</p>

<p>Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeus</sc></p>

<p>Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;</p>

<p>And what is mine my love shall render him.</p>

<p>And she is mine, and all my right of her</p>

<p>I do estate unto Demetrius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc> <i>[to Theseus]</i></p>

<p>I am, my lord, as well derived as he,</p>

<p>As well possessed. My love is more than his;</p>

<p>My fortunes every way as fairly ranked</p>

<p>(If not with vantage) as Demetrius’;</p>

<p>And (which is more than all these boasts can be)</p>

<p>I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.</p>

<p>Why should not I then prosecute my right?</p>

<p>Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,</p>

<p>Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,</p>

<p>And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,</p>

<p>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</p>

<p>Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Theseus</sc></p>

<p>I must confess that I have heard so much,</p>

<p>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;</p>

<p>But, being overfull of self-affairs,</p>

<p>My mind did lose it.–But, Demetrius, come,</p>

<p>And come, Egeus; you shall go with me.</p>

<p>I have some private schooling for you both.–</p>

<p>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself</p>

<p>To fit your fancies to your father’s will,</p>

<p>Or else the law of Athens yields you up</p>

<p>(Which by no means we may extenuate)</p>

<p>To death or to a vow of single life.–</p>

<p>Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?–</p>

<p>Demetrius and Egeus, go along.</p>

<p>I must employ you in some business</p>

<p>Against our nuptial and confer with you</p>

<p>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Egeus</sc></p>

<p>With duty and desire we follow you.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Hermia and Lysander exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?</p>

<p>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>Belike for want of rain, which I could well</p>

<p>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,</p>

<p>Could ever hear by tale or history,</p>

<p>The course of true love never did run smooth.</p>

<p>But either it was different in blood–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>O cross! Too high to be enthralled to low.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Or else misgraffed in respect of years–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>O spite! Too old to be engaged to young.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,</p>

<p>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,</p>

<p>Making it momentany as a sound,</p>

<p>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,</p>

<p>Brief as the lightning in the collied night,</p>

<p>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and Earth,</p>

<p>And, ere a man hath power to say “Behold!”</p>

<p>The jaws of darkness do devour it up.</p>

<p>So quick bright things come to confusion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>If then true lovers have been ever crossed,</p>

<p>It stands as an edict in destiny.</p>

<p>Then let us teach our trial patience</p>

<p>Because it is a customary cross,</p>

<p>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</p>

<p>Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>A good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia:</p>

<p>I have a widow aunt, a dowager</p>

<p>Of great revenue, and she hath no child.</p>

<p>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,</p>

<p>And she respects me as her only son.</p>

<p>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;</p>

<p>And to that place the sharp Athenian law</p>

<p>Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then</p>

<p>Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night,</p>

<p>And in the wood a league without the town</p>

<p>(Where I did meet thee once with Helena</p>

<p>To do observance to a morn of May),</p>

<p>There will I stay for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc>  My good Lysander,</p>

<p>I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,</p>

<p>By his best arrow with the golden head,</p>

<p>By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,</p>

<p>By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,</p>

<p>And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen</p>

<p>When the false Trojan under sail was seen,</p>

<p>By all the vows that ever men have broke</p>

<p>(In number more than ever women spoke),</p>

<p>In that same place thou hast appointed me,</p>

<p>Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Helena.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>Godspeed, fair Helena. Whither away?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>Call you me “fair”? That “fair” again unsay.</p>

<p>Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!</p>

<p>Your eyes are lodestars and your tongue’s sweet air</p>

<p>More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear</p>

<p>When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.</p>

<p>Sickness is catching. O, were favor so!</p>

<p>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.</p>

<p>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye;</p>

<p>My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet</p>

<p>melody.</p>

<p>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,</p>

<p>The rest I’d give to be to you translated.</p>

<p>O, teach me how you look and with what art</p>

<p>You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>O, that your frowns would teach my smiles such</p>

<p>skill!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>O, that my prayers could such affection move!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>The more I hate, the more he follows me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>The more I love, the more he hateth me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>None but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>Take comfort: he no more shall see my face.</p>

<p>Lysander and myself will fly this place.</p>

<p>Before the time I did Lysander see</p>

<p>Seemed Athens as a paradise to me.</p>

<p>O, then, what graces in my love do dwell</p>

<p>That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold</p>

<p>Her silver visage in the wat’ry glass,</p>

<p>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass</p>

<p>(A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),</p>

<p>Through Athens’ gates have we devised to steal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>And in the wood where often you and I</p>

<p>Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,</p>

<p>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,</p>

<p>There my Lysander and myself shall meet</p>

<p>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes</p>

<p>To seek new friends and stranger companies.</p>

<p>Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,</p>

<p>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.–</p>

<p>Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight</p>

<p>From lovers’ food till morrow deep midnight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>I will, my Hermia.     <i><i>[Hermia exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Helena, adieu.</p>

<p>As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!</p>

<p><center><i>[Lysander exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>How happy some o’er other some can be!</p>

<p>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</p>

<p>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.</p>

<p>He will not know what all but he do know.</p>

<p>And, as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,</p>

<p>So I, admiring of his qualities.</p>

<p>Things base and vile, holding no quantity,</p>

<p>Love can transpose to form and dignity.</p>

<p>Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;</p>

<p>And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.</p>

<p>Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste.</p>

<p>Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.</p>

<p>And therefore is Love said to be a child</p>

<p>Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.</p>

<p>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</p>

<p>So the boy Love is perjured everywhere.</p>

<p>For, ere Demetrius looked on Hermia’s eyne,</p>

<p>He hailed down oaths that he was only mine;</p>

<p>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</p>

<p>So he dissolved, and show’rs of oaths did melt.</p>

<p>I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.</p>

<p>Then to the wood will he tomorrow night</p>

<p>Pursue her. And, for this intelligence</p>

<p>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.</p>

<p>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</p>

<p>To have his sight thither and back again.</p>
