<p><center><i>[Enter Oberon, King of Fairies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>I wonder if Titania be awaked;</p>

<p>Then what it was that next came in her eye,</p>

<p>Which she must dote on in extremity.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robin Goodfellow.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Here comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit?</p>

<p>What night-rule now about this haunted grove?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>My mistress with a monster is in love.</p>

<p>Near to her close and consecrated bower,</p>

<p>While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,</p>

<p>A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,</p>

<p>That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,</p>

<p>Were met together to rehearse a play</p>

<p>Intended for great Theseus’ nuptial day.</p>

<p>The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,</p>

<p>Who Pyramus presented in their sport,</p>

<p>Forsook his scene and entered in a brake.</p>

<p>When I did him at this advantage take,</p>

<p>An ass’s noll I fixed on his head.</p>

<p>Anon his Thisbe must be answered,</p>

<p>And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,</p>

<p>As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,</p>

<p>Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,</p>

<p>Rising and cawing at the gun’s report,</p>

<p>Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,</p>

<p>So at his sight away his fellows fly,</p>

<p>And, at our stamp, here o’er and o’er one falls.</p>

<p>He “Murder” cries and help from Athens calls.</p>

<p>Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus</p>

<p>strong,</p>

<p>Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;</p>

<p>For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch,</p>

<p>Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things</p>

<p>catch.</p>

<p>I led them on in this distracted fear</p>

<p>And left sweet Pyramus translated there.</p>

<p>When in that moment, so it came to pass,</p>

<p>Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>This falls out better than I could devise.</p>

<p>But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes</p>

<p>With the love juice, as I did bid thee do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>I took him sleeping–that is finished, too–</p>

<p>And the Athenian woman by his side,</p>

<p>That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Demetrius and Hermia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>Stand close. This is the same Athenian.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>This is the woman, but not this the man.</p>

<p><center><i>[They step aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?</p>

<p>Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse,</p>

<p>For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.</p>

<p>If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,</p>

<p>Being o’er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep</p>

<p>And kill me too.</p>

<p>The sun was not so true unto the day</p>

<p>As he to me. Would he have stolen away</p>

<p>From sleeping Hermia? I’ll believe as soon</p>

<p>This whole Earth may be bored, and that the moon</p>

<p>May through the center creep and so displease</p>

<p>Her brother’s noontide with th’ Antipodes.</p>

<p>It cannot be but thou hast murdered him.</p>

<p>So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>So should the murdered look, and so should I,</p>

<p>Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty.</p>

<p>Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,</p>

<p>As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>What’s this to my Lysander? Where is he?</p>

<p>Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>Out, dog! Out, cur! Thou driv’st me past the bounds</p>

<p>Of maiden’s patience. Hast thou slain him, then?</p>

<p>Henceforth be never numbered among men.</p>

<p>O, once tell true! Tell true, even for my sake!</p>

<p>Durst thou have looked upon him, being awake?</p>

<p>And hast thou killed him sleeping? O brave touch!</p>

<p>Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?</p>

<p>An adder did it, for with doubler tongue</p>

<p>Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>You spend your passion on a misprised mood.</p>

<p>I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood,</p>

<p>Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>An if I could, what should I get therefor?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>A privilege never to see me more.</p>

<p>And from thy hated presence part I so.</p>

<p>See me no more, whether he be dead or no.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>There is no following her in this fierce vein.</p>

<p>Here, therefore, for a while I will remain.</p>

<p>So sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier grow</p>

<p>For debt that bankrout sleep doth sorrow owe,</p>

<p>Which now in some slight measure it will pay,</p>

<p>If for his tender here I make some stay.</p>

<p><center><i>[He lies down and falls asleep.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc> <i>[to Robin]</i></p>

<p>What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite</p>

<p>And laid the love juice on some true-love’s sight.</p>

<p>Of thy misprision must perforce ensue</p>

<p>Some true-love turned, and not a false turned true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>Then fate o’errules, that, one man holding troth,</p>

<p>A million fail, confounding oath on oath.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>About the wood go swifter than the wind,</p>

<p>And Helena of Athens look thou find.</p>

<p>All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer</p>

<p>With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear.</p>

<p>By some illusion see thou bring her here.</p>

<p>I’ll charm his eyes against she do appear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc>  I go, I go, look how I go,</p>

<p>Swifter than arrow from the Tartar’s bow.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc> <i>[applying the nectar to Demetrius’ eyes]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Flower of this purple dye,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Hit with Cupid’s archery,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Sink in apple of his eye.</i></p>

<p>     <i>When his love he doth espy,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Let her shine as gloriously</i></p>

<p>     <i>As the Venus of the sky.–</i></p>

<p>     <i>When thou wak’st, if she be by,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Beg of her for remedy.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robin.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Captain of our fairy band,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Helena is here at hand,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And the youth, mistook by me,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Pleading for a lover’s fee.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Shall we their fond pageant see?</i></p>

<p>     <i>Lord, what fools these mortals be!</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Stand aside. The noise they make</i></p>

<p>     <i>Will cause Demetrius to awake.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Then will two at once woo one.</i></p>

<p>     <i>That must needs be sport alone.</i></p>

<p>     <i>And those things do best please me</i></p>

<p>     <i>That befall prepost’rously.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[They step aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lysander and Helena.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?</p>

<p>   <i>Scorn and derision never come in tears.</i></p>

<p>Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,</p>

<p>   <i>In their nativity all truth appears.</i></p>

<p>How can these things in me seem scorn to you,</p>

<p>Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>You do advance your cunning more and more.</p>

<p>   <i>When truth kills truth, O devilish holy fray!</i></p>

<p>These vows are Hermia’s. Will you give her o’er?</p>

<p>   <i>Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing</i></p>

<p>   <i>weigh.</i></p>

<p>Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,</p>

<p>Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>I had no judgment when to her I swore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o’er.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc> <i>[waking up]</i></p>

<p>O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!</p>

<p>To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?</p>

<p>Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show</p>

<p>Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!</p>

<p>That pure congealed white, high Taurus’ snow,</p>

<p>Fanned with the eastern wind, turns to a crow</p>

<p>When thou hold’st up thy hand. O, let me kiss</p>

<p>This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent</p>

<p>To set against me for your merriment.</p>

<p>If you were civil and knew courtesy,</p>

<p>You would not do me thus much injury.</p>

<p>Can you not hate me, as I know you do,</p>

<p>But you must join in souls to mock me too?</p>

<p>If you were men, as men you are in show,</p>

<p>You would not use a gentle lady so,</p>

<p>To vow and swear and superpraise my parts,</p>

<p>When, I am sure, you hate me with your hearts.</p>

<p>You both are rivals and love Hermia,</p>

<p>And now both rivals to mock Helena.</p>

<p>A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,</p>

<p>To conjure tears up in a poor maid’s eyes</p>

<p>With your derision! None of noble sort</p>

<p>Would so offend a virgin and extort</p>

<p>A poor soul’s patience, all to make you sport.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>You are unkind, Demetrius. Be not so,</p>

<p>For you love Hermia; this you know I know.</p>

<p>And here with all goodwill, with all my heart,</p>

<p>In Hermia’s love I yield you up my part.</p>

<p>And yours of Helena to me bequeath,</p>

<p>Whom I do love and will do till my death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>Never did mockers waste more idle breath.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>Lysander, keep thy Hermia. I will none.</p>

<p>If e’er I loved her, all that love is gone.</p>

<p>My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourned,</p>

<p>And now to Helen is it home returned,</p>

<p>There to remain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  Helen, it is not so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,</p>

<p>Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear.</p>

<p>Look where thy love comes. Yonder is thy dear.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hermia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc> <i>[to Lysander]</i></p>

<p>Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,</p>

<p>The ear more quick of apprehension makes;</p>

<p>Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,</p>

<p>It pays the hearing double recompense.</p>

<p>Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;</p>

<p>Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.</p>

<p>But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>What love could press Lysander from my side?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Lysander’s love, that would not let him bide,</p>

<p>Fair Helena, who more engilds the night</p>

<p>Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.</p>

<p>Why seek’st thou me? Could not this make thee</p>

<p>know</p>

<p>The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>You speak not as you think. It cannot be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>Lo, she is one of this confederacy!</p>

<p>Now I perceive they have conjoined all three</p>

<p>To fashion this false sport in spite of me.–</p>

<p>Injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid,</p>

<p>Have you conspired, have you with these contrived,</p>

<p>To bait me with this foul derision?</p>

<p>Is all the counsel that we two have shared,</p>

<p>The sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent</p>

<p>When we have chid the hasty-footed time</p>

<p>For parting us–O, is all forgot?</p>

<p>All schooldays’ friendship, childhood innocence?</p>

<p>We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,</p>

<p>Have with our needles created both one flower,</p>

<p>Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,</p>

<p>Both warbling of one song, both in one key,</p>

<p>As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds</p>

<p>Had been incorporate. So we grew together</p>

<p>Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,</p>

<p>But yet an union in partition,</p>

<p>Two lovely berries molded on one stem;</p>

<p>So with two seeming bodies but one heart,</p>

<p>Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,</p>

<p>Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.</p>

<p>And will you rent our ancient love asunder,</p>

<p>To join with men in scorning your poor friend?</p>

<p>It is not friendly; ’tis not maidenly.</p>

<p>Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,</p>

<p>Though I alone do feel the injury.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>I am amazed at your words.</p>

<p>I scorn you not. It seems that you scorn me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,</p>

<p>To follow me and praise my eyes and face,</p>

<p>And made your other love, Demetrius,</p>

<p>Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,</p>

<p>To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,</p>

<p>Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this</p>

<p>To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander</p>

<p>Deny your love (so rich within his soul)</p>

<p>And tender me, forsooth, affection,</p>

<p>But by your setting on, by your consent?</p>

<p>What though I be not so in grace as you,</p>

<p>So hung upon with love, so fortunate,</p>

<p>But miserable most, to love unloved?</p>

<p>This you should pity rather than despise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>I understand not what you mean by this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>Ay, do. Persever, counterfeit sad looks,</p>

<p>Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,</p>

<p>Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up.</p>

<p>This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.</p>

<p>If you have any pity, grace, or manners,</p>

<p>You would not make me such an argument.</p>

<p>But fare you well. ’Tis partly my own fault,</p>

<p>Which death or absence soon shall remedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Stay, gentle Helena. Hear my excuse,</p>

<p>My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>O excellent!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc> <i>[to Lysander]</i></p>

<p>Sweet, do not scorn her so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc> <i>[to Lysander]</i></p>

<p>If she cannot entreat, I can compel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Thou canst compel no more than she entreat.</p>

<p>Thy threats have no more strength than her weak</p>

<p>prayers.–</p>

<p>Helen, I love thee. By my life, I do.</p>

<p>I swear by that which I will lose for thee,</p>

<p>To prove him false that says I love thee not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>I say I love thee more than he can do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>If thou say so, withdraw and prove it too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>Quick, come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc>  Lysander, whereto tends all this?</p>

<p><center><i>[She takes hold of Lysander.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Away, you Ethiop!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc> <i>[to Hermia]</i></p>

<p>No, no. He’ll</p>

<p>Seem to break loose. <i>[To Lysander.]</i> Take on as you</p>

<p>would follow,</p>

<p>But yet come not. You are a tame man, go!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc> <i>[to Hermia]</i></p>

<p>Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! Vile thing, let loose,</p>

<p>Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>Why are you grown so rude? What change is this,</p>

<p>Sweet love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  Thy love? Out, tawny Tartar, out!</p>

<p>Out, loathed med’cine! O, hated potion, hence!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>Do you not jest?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc>  Yes, sooth, and so do you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>I would I had your bond. For I perceive</p>

<p>A weak bond holds you. I’ll not trust your word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>What? Should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?</p>

<p>Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>What, can you do me greater harm than hate?</p>

<p>Hate me? Wherefore? O me, what news, my love?</p>

<p>Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?</p>

<p>I am as fair now as I was erewhile.</p>

<p>Since night you loved me; yet since night you left</p>

<p>me.</p>

<p>Why, then, you left me–O, the gods forbid!–</p>

<p>In earnest, shall I say?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  Ay, by my life,</p>

<p>And never did desire to see thee more.</p>

<p>Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt.</p>

<p>Be certain, nothing truer, ’tis no jest</p>

<p>That I do hate thee and love Helena.</p>

<p><center><i>[Hermia turns him loose.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>O me! <i>[To Helena.]</i> You juggler, you cankerblossom,</p>

<p>You thief of love! What, have you come by night</p>

<p>And stol’n my love’s heart from him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc>  Fine, i’ faith.</p>

<p>Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,</p>

<p>No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear</p>

<p>Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?</p>

<p>Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>“Puppet”? Why so? Ay, that way goes the game.</p>

<p>Now I perceive that she hath made compare</p>

<p>Between our statures; she hath urged her height,</p>

<p>And with her personage, her tall personage,</p>

<p>Her height, forsooth, she hath prevailed with him.</p>

<p>And are you grown so high in his esteem</p>

<p>Because I am so dwarfish and so low?</p>

<p>How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak!</p>

<p>How low am I? I am not yet so low</p>

<p>But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,</p>

<p>Let her not hurt me. I was never curst;</p>

<p>I have no gift at all in shrewishness.</p>

<p>I am a right maid for my cowardice.</p>

<p>Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,</p>

<p>Because she is something lower than myself,</p>

<p>That I can match her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc>  “Lower”? Hark, again!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.</p>

<p>I evermore did love you, Hermia,</p>

<p>Did ever keep your counsels, never wronged you–</p>

<p>Save that, in love unto Demetrius,</p>

<p>I told him of your stealth unto this wood.</p>

<p>He followed you; for love, I followed him.</p>

<p>But he hath chid me hence and threatened me</p>

<p>To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too.</p>

<p>And now, so you will let me quiet go,</p>

<p>To Athens will I bear my folly back</p>

<p>And follow you no further. Let me go.</p>

<p>You see how simple and how fond I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>Why, get you gone. Who is ’t that hinders you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>A foolish heart that I leave here behind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>What, with Lysander?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc>  With Demetrius.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Be not afraid. She shall not harm thee, Helena.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>O, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd.</p>

<p>She was a vixen when she went to school,</p>

<p>And though she be but little, she is fierce.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>“Little” again? Nothing but “low” and “little”?</p>

<p>Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?</p>

<p>Let me come to her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  Get you gone, you dwarf,</p>

<p>You minimus of hind’ring knotgrass made,</p>

<p>You bead, you acorn–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  You are too officious</p>

<p>In her behalf that scorns your services.</p>

<p>Let her alone. Speak not of Helena.</p>

<p>Take not her part. For if thou dost intend</p>

<p>Never so little show of love to her,</p>

<p>Thou shalt aby it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  Now she holds me not.</p>

<p>Now follow, if thou dar’st, to try whose right,</p>

<p>Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>“Follow”? Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jowl.</p>

<p><center><i>[Demetrius and Lysander exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Helena retreats.]</i></center></p>

<p>Nay, go not back.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc>  I will not trust you, I,</p>

<p>Nor longer stay in your curst company.</p>

<p>Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray.</p>

<p>My legs are longer though, to run away.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>I am amazed and know not what to say.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc> <i>[to Robin]</i></p>

<p>This is thy negligence. Still thou mistak’st,</p>

<p>Or else committ’st thy knaveries willfully.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.</p>

<p>Did not you tell me I should know the man</p>

<p>By the Athenian garments he had on?</p>

<p>And so far blameless proves my enterprise</p>

<p>That I have ’nointed an Athenian’s eyes;</p>

<p>And so far am I glad it so did sort,</p>

<p>As this their jangling I esteem a sport.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.</p>

<p>Hie, therefore, Robin, overcast the night;</p>

<p>The starry welkin cover thou anon</p>

<p>With drooping fog as black as Acheron,</p>

<p>And lead these testy rivals so astray</p>

<p>As one come not within another’s way.</p>

<p>Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue;</p>

<p>Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong.</p>

<p>And sometime rail thou like Demetrius.</p>

<p>And from each other look thou lead them thus,</p>

<p>Till o’er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep</p>

<p>With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.</p>

<p>Then crush this herb into Lysander’s eye,</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives a flower to Robin.]</i></center></p>

<p>Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,</p>

<p>To take from thence all error with his might</p>

<p>And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.</p>

<p>When they next wake, all this derision</p>

<p>Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision.</p>

<p>And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,</p>

<p>With league whose date till death shall never end.</p>

<p>Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,</p>

<p>I’ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;</p>

<p>And then I will her charmed eye release</p>

<p>From monster’s view, and all things shall be peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,</p>

<p>For night’s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,</p>

<p>And yonder shines Aurora’s harbinger,</p>

<p>At whose approach, ghosts wand’ring here and</p>

<p>there</p>

<p>Troop home to churchyards. Damned spirits all,</p>

<p>That in crossways and floods have burial,</p>

<p>Already to their wormy beds are gone.</p>

<p>For fear lest day should look their shames upon,</p>

<p>They willfully themselves exile from light</p>

<p>And must for aye consort with black-browed night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>But we are spirits of another sort.</p>

<p>I with the Morning’s love have oft made sport</p>

<p>And, like a forester, the groves may tread</p>

<p>Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red,</p>

<p>Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,</p>

<p>Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding, haste! Make no delay.</p>

<p>We may effect this business yet ere day.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Up and down, up and down,</i></p>

<p>     <i>I will lead them up and down.</i></p>

<p>     <i>I am feared in field and town.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Goblin, lead them up and down.</i></p>

<p>Here comes one.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lysander.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc> <i>[in Demetrius’ voice]</i></p>

<p>Here, villain, drawn and ready. Where art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc>  I will be with thee straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc> <i>[in Demetrius’ voice]</i>  Follow me, then, to</p>

<p>plainer ground.     <i><i>[Lysander exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Demetrius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  Lysander, speak again.</p>

<p>Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?</p>

<p>Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy</p>

<p>head?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc> <i>[in Lysander’s voice]</i></p>

<p>Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,</p>

<p>Telling the bushes that thou look’st for wars,</p>

<p>And wilt not come? Come, recreant! Come, thou</p>

<p>child!</p>

<p>I’ll whip thee with a rod. He is defiled</p>

<p>That draws a sword on thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc>  Yea, art thou there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc> <i>[in Lysander’s voice]</i></p>

<p>Follow my voice. We’ll try no manhood here.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lysander.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lysander</sc></p>

<p>He goes before me and still dares me on.</p>

<p>When I come where he calls, then he is gone.</p>

<p>The villain is much lighter-heeled than I.</p>

<p>I followed fast, but faster he did fly,</p>

<p>That fallen am I in dark uneven way,</p>

<p>And here will rest me. Come, thou gentle day,</p>

<p>For if but once thou show me thy gray light,</p>

<p>I’ll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.</p>

<p><center><i>[He lies down and sleeps.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robin and Demetrius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc> <i>[in Lysander’s voice]</i></p>

<p>Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com’st thou not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>Abide me, if thou dar’st, for well I wot</p>

<p>Thou runn’st before me, shifting every place,</p>

<p>And dar’st not stand nor look me in the face.</p>

<p>Where art thou now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc> <i>[in Lysander’s voice]</i></p>

<p>Come hither. I am here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>Nay, then, thou mock’st me. Thou shalt buy this</p>

<p>dear</p>

<p>If ever I thy face by daylight see.</p>

<p>Now go thy way. Faintness constraineth me</p>

<p>To measure out my length on this cold bed.</p>

<p>By day’s approach look to be visited.</p>

<p><center><i>[He lies down and sleeps.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Helena.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>O weary night, O long and tedious night,</p>

<p>   <i>Abate thy hours! Shine, comforts, from the east,</i></p>

<p>That I may back to Athens by daylight</p>

<p>   <i>From these that my poor company detest.</i></p>

<p>And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye,</p>

<p>Steal me awhile from mine own company.</p>

<p><center><i>[She lies down and sleeps.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Yet but three? Come one more.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Two of both kinds makes up four.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Here she comes, curst and sad.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Cupid is a knavish lad</i></p>

<p>     <i>Thus to make poor females mad.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hermia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hermia</sc></p>

<p>Never so weary, never so in woe,</p>

<p>   <i>Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,</i></p>

<p>I can no further crawl, no further go.</p>

<p>   <i>My legs can keep no pace with my desires.</i></p>

<p>Here will I rest me till the break of day.</p>

<p>Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray!</p>

<p><center><i>[She lies down and sleeps.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>        <i>On the ground</i></p>

<p>        <i>Sleep sound.</i></p>

<p>        <i>I’ll apply</i></p>

<p>        <i>To your eye,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Gentle lover, remedy.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Robin applies the nectar </p>

<p> to Lysander’s eyes.]</i></center></p>

<p>        <i>When thou wak’st,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Thou tak’st</i></p>

<p>        <i>True delight</i></p>

<p>        <i>In the sight</i></p>

<p>     <i>Of thy former lady’s eye.</i></p>

<p>     <i>And the country proverb known,</i></p>

<p>     <i>That every man should take his own,</i></p>

<p>     <i>In your waking shall be shown.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Jack shall have Jill;</i></p>

<p>        <i>Naught shall go ill;</i></p>

<p>     <i>The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be</i></p>

<p>well.</p>
