<p><center><i>[Enter Quince the carpenter, and Snug the joiner, and</p>

<p>Bottom the weaver, and Flute the bellows-mender, and</p>

<p>Snout the tinker, and Starveling the tailor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Is all our company here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  You were best to call them generally, man by</p>

<p>man, according to the scrip.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Here is the scroll of every man’s name which</p>

<p>is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our</p>

<p>interlude before the Duke and the Duchess on his</p>

<p>wedding day at night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  First, good Peter Quince, say what the play</p>

<p>treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so</p>

<p>grow to a point.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Marry, our play is “The most lamentable</p>

<p>comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and</p>

<p>Thisbe.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a</p>

<p>merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your</p>

<p>actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Ready. Name what part I am for, and</p>

<p>proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  What is Pyramus–a lover or a tyrant?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  A lover that kills himself most gallant for love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  That will ask some tears in the true performing</p>

<p>of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their</p>

<p>eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some</p>

<p>measure. To the rest.–Yet my chief humor is for a</p>

<p>tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a</p>

<p>cat in, to make all split:</p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>The raging rocks</i></p>

<p>     <i>And shivering shocks</i></p>

<p>     <i>Shall break the locks</i></p>

<p>        <i>Of prison gates.</i></p>

<p>     <i>And Phibbus’ car</i></p>

<p>     <i>Shall shine from far</i></p>

<p>     <i>And make and mar</i></p>

<p>        <i>The foolish Fates.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players.</p>

<p>This is Ercles’ vein, a tyrant’s vein. A lover is more</p>

<p>condoling.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc>  Here, Peter Quince.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc>  What is Thisbe–a wand’ring knight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  It is the lady that Pyramus must love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Flute</sc>  Nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a</p>

<p>beard coming.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  That’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and</p>

<p>you may speak as small as you will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too.</p>

<p>I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice: “Thisne,</p>

<p>Thisne!”–“Ah Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisbe</p>

<p>dear and lady dear!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  No, no, you must play Pyramus–and, Flute,</p>

<p>you Thisbe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Well, proceed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Robin Starveling, the tailor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Starveling</sc>  Here, Peter Quince.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s</p>

<p>mother.–Tom Snout, the tinker.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snout</sc>  Here, Peter Quince.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  You, Pyramus’ father.–Myself, Thisbe’s</p>

<p>father.–Snug the joiner, you the lion’s part.–</p>

<p>And I hope here is a play fitted.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Snug</sc>  Have you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it</p>

<p>be, give it me, for I am slow of study.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but</p>

<p>roaring.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will</p>

<p>do any man’s heart good to hear me. I will roar that</p>

<p>I will make the Duke say “Let him roar again. Let</p>

<p>him roar again!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  An you should do it too terribly, you would</p>

<p>fright the Duchess and the ladies that they would</p>

<p>shriek, and that were enough to hang us all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  That would hang us, every mother’s son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  I grant you, friends, if you should fright the</p>

<p>ladies out of their wits, they would have no more</p>

<p>discretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my</p>

<p>voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking</p>

<p>dove. I will roar you an ’twere any nightingale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus</p>

<p>is a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one</p>

<p>shall see in a summer’s day, a most lovely gentlemanlike</p>

<p>man. Therefore you must needs play </p>

<p>Pyramus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I</p>

<p>best to play it in?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Why, what you will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  I will discharge it in either your straw-color</p>

<p>beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain</p>

<p>beard, or your French-crown-color beard,</p>

<p>your perfit yellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  Some of your French crowns have no hair at</p>

<p>all, and then you will play barefaced. But, masters,</p>

<p>here are your parts, <i>[giving out the parts,]</i> and I am</p>

<p>to entreat you, request you, and desire you to con</p>

<p>them by tomorrow night and meet me in the palace</p>

<p>wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight. There</p>

<p>will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall</p>

<p>be dogged with company and our devices known. In</p>

<p>the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as</p>

<p>our play wants. I pray you fail me not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  We will meet, and there we may rehearse</p>

<p>most obscenely and courageously. Take pains. Be</p>

<p>perfit. Adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Quince</sc>  At the Duke’s Oak we meet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bottom</sc>  Enough. Hold or cut bowstrings.</p>
