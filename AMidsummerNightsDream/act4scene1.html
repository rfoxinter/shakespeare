<p><center><i>[With the four lovers still asleep onstage, enter</p>

<p>Titania, Queen of Fairies, and Bottom and Fairies,</p>

<p>and Oberon, the King, behind them unseen by those</p>

<p>onstage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titania</span></p>

<p>Come, sit thee down upon this flow’ry bed,</p>

<p>   <i>While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,</i></p>

<p>And stick muskroses in thy sleek smooth head,</p>

<p>   <i>And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bottom</span>  Where’s Peaseblossom?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Peaseblossom</span>  Ready.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bottom</span>  Scratch my head, Peaseblossom. Where’s</p>

<p>Monsieur Cobweb?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cobweb</span>  Ready.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bottom</span>  Monsieur Cobweb, good monsieur, get you</p>

<p>your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped</p>

<p>humble-bee on the top of a thistle, and, good</p>

<p>monsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret</p>

<p>yourself too much in the action, monsieur, and,</p>

<p>good monsieur, have a care the honey-bag break</p>

<p>not; I would be loath to have you overflown with a</p>

<p>honey-bag, signior. <i>[Cobweb exits.]</i> Where’s Monsieur</p>

<p>Mustardseed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mustardseed</span>  Ready.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bottom</span>  Give me your neaf, Monsieur Mustardseed.</p>

<p>Pray you, leave your courtesy, good monsieur.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Mustardseed</span>  What’s your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bottom</span>  Nothing, good monsieur, but to help Cavalery</p>

<p>Cobweb to scratch. I must to the barber’s,</p>

<p>monsieur, for methinks I am marvels hairy about</p>

<p>the face. And I am such a tender ass, if my hair do</p>

<p>but tickle me, I must scratch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titania</span></p>

<p>What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bottom</span>  I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let’s</p>

<p>have the tongs and the bones.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titania</span></p>

<p>Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bottom</span>  Truly, a peck of provender. I could munch</p>

<p>your good dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire</p>

<p>to a bottle of hay. Good hay, sweet hay, hath no</p>

<p>fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titania</span></p>

<p>I have a venturous fairy that shall seek</p>

<p>The squirrel’s hoard and fetch thee new nuts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bottom</span>  I had rather have a handful or two of dried</p>

<p>peas. But, I pray you, let none of your people stir</p>

<p>me; I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titania</span></p>

<p>Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.–</p>

<p>Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.</p>

<p><center><i>[Fairies exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle</p>

<p>Gently entwist; the female ivy so</p>

<p>Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.</p>

<p>O, how I love thee! How I dote on thee!</p>

<p><center><i>[Bottom and Titania sleep.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robin Goodfellow.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oberon</span></p>

<p>Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet sight?</p>

<p>Her dotage now I do begin to pity.</p>

<p>For, meeting her of late behind the wood,</p>

<p>Seeking sweet favors for this hateful fool,</p>

<p>I did upbraid her and fall out with her.</p>

<p>For she his hairy temples then had rounded</p>

<p>With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;</p>

<p>And that same dew, which sometime on the buds</p>

<p>Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,</p>

<p>Stood now within the pretty flouriets’ eyes,</p>

<p>Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.</p>

<p>When I had at my pleasure taunted her,</p>

<p>And she in mild terms begged my patience,</p>

<p>I then did ask of her her changeling child,</p>

<p>Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent</p>

<p>To bear him to my bower in Fairyland.</p>

<p>And now I have the boy, I will undo</p>

<p>This hateful imperfection of her eyes.</p>

<p>And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp</p>

<p>From off the head of this Athenian swain,</p>

<p>That he, awaking when the other do,</p>

<p>May all to Athens back again repair</p>

<p>And think no more of this night’s accidents</p>

<p>But as the fierce vexation of a dream.</p>

<p>But first I will release the Fairy Queen.</p>

<p><center><i>[He applies the nectar to her eyes.]</i></center></p>

<p>     <i>Be as thou wast wont to be.</i></p>

<p>     <i>See as thou wast wont to see.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Dian’s bud o’er Cupid’s flower</i></p>

<p>     <i>Hath such force and blessed power.</i></p>

<p>Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titania</span> <i>[waking]</i></p>

<p>My Oberon, what visions have I seen!</p>

<p>Methought I was enamored of an ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oberon</span></p>

<p>There lies your love.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titania</span>  How came these things to pass?</p>

<p>O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oberon</span></p>

<p>Silence awhile.–Robin, take off this head.–</p>

<p>Titania, music call; and strike more dead</p>

<p>Than common sleep of all these five the sense.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titania</span></p>

<p>Music, ho, music such as charmeth sleep!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Robin</span> <i>[removing the ass-head from Bottom]</i></p>

<p>Now, when thou wak’st, with thine own fool’s eyes</p>

<p>peep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oberon</span></p>

<p>Sound music.     <i><i>[Music.]</i></i></p>

<p>Come, my queen, take hands with me,</p>

<p>And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.</p>

<p><center><i>[Titania and Oberon dance.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now thou and I are new in amity,</p>

<p>And will tomorrow midnight solemnly</p>

<p>Dance in Duke Theseus’ house triumphantly,</p>

<p>And bless it to all fair prosperity.</p>

<p>There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be</p>

<p>Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Robin</span></p>

<p>     <i>Fairy king, attend and mark.</i></p>

<p>     <i>I do hear the morning lark.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oberon</span></p>

<p>     <i>Then, my queen, in silence sad</i></p>

<p>     <i>Trip we after night’s shade.</i></p>

<p>     <i>We the globe can compass soon,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Swifter than the wand’ring moon.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Titania</span></p>

<p>     <i>Come, my lord, and in our flight</i></p>

<p>     <i>Tell me how it came this night</i></p>

<p>     <i>That I sleeping here was found</i></p>

<p>     <i>With these mortals on the ground.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[Oberon, Robin, and Titania exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Wind horn. Enter Theseus and all his train,</p>

<p>Hippolyta, Egeus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>Go, one of you, find out the Forester.</p>

<p>For now our observation is performed,</p>

<p>And, since we have the vaward of the day,</p>

<p>My love shall hear the music of my hounds.</p>

<p>Uncouple in the western valley; let them go.</p>

<p>Dispatch, I say, and find the Forester.</p>

<p><center><i>[A Servant exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>We will, fair queen, up to the mountain’s top</p>

<p>And mark the musical confusion</p>

<p>Of hounds and echo in conjunction.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hippolyta</span></p>

<p>I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,</p>

<p>When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear</p>

<p>With hounds of Sparta. Never did I hear</p>

<p>Such gallant chiding, for, besides the groves,</p>

<p>The skies, the fountains, every region near</p>

<p>Seemed all one mutual cry. I never heard</p>

<p>So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,</p>

<p>So flewed, so sanded; and their heads are hung</p>

<p>With ears that sweep away the morning dew;</p>

<p>Crook-kneed, and dewlapped like Thessalian bulls;</p>

<p>Slow in pursuit, but matched in mouth like bells,</p>

<p>Each under each. A cry more tunable</p>

<p>Was never holloed to, nor cheered with horn,</p>

<p>In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.</p>

<p>Judge when you hear.–But soft! What nymphs are</p>

<p>these?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Egeus</span></p>

<p>My lord, this is my daughter here asleep,</p>

<p>And this Lysander; this Demetrius is,</p>

<p>This Helena, old Nedar’s Helena.</p>

<p>I wonder of their being here together.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>No doubt they rose up early to observe</p>

<p>The rite of May, and hearing our intent,</p>

<p>Came here in grace of our solemnity.</p>

<p>But speak, Egeus. Is not this the day</p>

<p>That Hermia should give answer of her choice?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Egeus</span>  It is, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.</p>

<p><center><i>[A Servant exits.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Shout within. Wind horns. They all start up.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past.</p>

<p>Begin these woodbirds but to couple now?</p>

<p><center><i>[Demetrius, Helena, Hermia, and Lysander kneel.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysander</span></p>

<p>Pardon, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span>  I pray you all, stand up.</p>

<p><center><i>[They rise.]</i></center></p>

<p>I know you two are rival enemies.</p>

<p>How comes this gentle concord in the world,</p>

<p>That hatred is so far from jealousy</p>

<p>To sleep by hate and fear no enmity?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysander</span></p>

<p>My lord, I shall reply amazedly,</p>

<p>Half sleep, half waking. But as yet, I swear,</p>

<p>I cannot truly say how I came here.</p>

<p>But, as I think–for truly would I speak,</p>

<p>And now I do bethink me, so it is:</p>

<p>I came with Hermia hither. Our intent</p>

<p>Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,</p>

<p>Without the peril of the Athenian law–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Egeus</span></p>

<p>Enough, enough!–My lord, you have enough.</p>

<p>I beg the law, the law upon his head.</p>

<p>They would have stol’n away.–They would,</p>

<p>Demetrius,</p>

<p>Thereby to have defeated you and me:</p>

<p>You of your wife and me of my consent,</p>

<p>Of my consent that she should be your wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,</p>

<p>Of this their purpose hither to this wood,</p>

<p>And I in fury hither followed them,</p>

<p>Fair Helena in fancy following me.</p>

<p>But, my good lord, I wot not by what power</p>

<p>(But by some power it is) my love to Hermia,</p>

<p>Melted as the snow, seems to me now</p>

<p>As the remembrance of an idle gaud</p>

<p>Which in my childhood I did dote upon,</p>

<p>And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,</p>

<p>The object and the pleasure of mine eye,</p>

<p>Is only Helena. To her, my lord,</p>

<p>Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia.</p>

<p>But like a sickness did I loathe this food.</p>

<p>But, as in health, come to my natural taste,</p>

<p>Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,</p>

<p>And will forevermore be true to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Theseus</span></p>

<p>Fair lovers, you are fortunately met.</p>

<p>Of this discourse we more will hear anon.–</p>

<p>Egeus, I will overbear your will,</p>

<p>For in the temple by and by, with us,</p>

<p>These couples shall eternally be knit.–</p>

<p>And, for the morning now is something worn,</p>

<p>Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.</p>

<p>Away with us to Athens. Three and three,</p>

<p>We’ll hold a feast in great solemnity.</p>

<p>Come, Hippolyta.</p>

<p><center><i>[Theseus and his train,</p>

<p>including Hippolyta and Egeus, exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>These things seem small and undistinguishable,</p>

<p>Like far-off mountains turned into clouds.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermia</span></p>

<p>Methinks I see these things with parted eye,</p>

<p>When everything seems double.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helena</span>  So methinks.</p>

<p>And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,</p>

<p>Mine own and not mine own.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span>  Are you sure</p>

<p>That we are awake? It seems to me</p>

<p>That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think</p>

<p>The Duke was here and bid us follow him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hermia</span></p>

<p>Yea, and my father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Helena</span>  And Hippolyta.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lysander</span></p>

<p>And he did bid us follow to the temple.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Demetrius</span></p>

<p>Why, then, we are awake. Let’s follow him,</p>

<p>And by the way let us recount our dreams.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lovers exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bottom</span> <i>[waking up]</i>   <i>When my cue comes, call me,</i></p>

<p>and I will answer. My next is “Most fair Pyramus.”</p>

<p>Hey-ho! Peter Quince! Flute the bellows-mender!</p>

<p>Snout the tinker! Starveling! God’s my life! Stolen</p>

<p>hence and left me asleep! I have had a most rare</p>

<p>vision. I have had a dream past the wit of man to say</p>

<p>what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about</p>

<p>to expound this dream. Methought I was–there</p>

<p>is no man can tell what. Methought I was and</p>

<p>methought I had–but man is but a patched fool if</p>

<p>he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of</p>

<p>man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen,</p>

<p>man’s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to</p>

<p>conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream</p>

<p>was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this</p>

<p>dream. It shall be called “Bottom’s Dream” because</p>

<p>it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the</p>

<p>latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure,</p>

<p>to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her</p>

<p>death.</p>
