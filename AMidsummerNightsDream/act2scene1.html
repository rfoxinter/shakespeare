<p><center><i>[Enter a Fairy at one door and Robin Goodfellow at</p>

<p>another.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>How now, spirit? Whither wander you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fairy</sc></p>

<p>     <i>Over hill, over dale,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Thorough bush, thorough brier,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Over park, over pale,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Thorough flood, thorough fire;</i></p>

<p>     <i>I do wander everywhere,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Swifter than the moon’s sphere.</i></p>

<p>     <i>And I serve the Fairy Queen,</i></p>

<p>     <i>To dew her orbs upon the green.</i></p>

<p>     <i>The cowslips tall her pensioners be;</i></p>

<p>     <i>In their gold coats spots you see;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Those be rubies, fairy favors;</i></p>

<p>     <i>In those freckles live their savors.</i></p>

<p>I must go seek some dewdrops here</p>

<p>And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.</p>

<p>Farewell, thou lob of spirits. I’ll be gone.</p>

<p>Our queen and all her elves come here anon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>The King doth keep his revels here tonight.</p>

<p>Take heed the Queen come not within his sight,</p>

<p>For Oberon is passing fell and wrath</p>

<p>Because that she, as her attendant, hath</p>

<p>A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;</p>

<p>She never had so sweet a changeling.</p>

<p>And jealous Oberon would have the child</p>

<p>Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild.</p>

<p>But she perforce withholds the loved boy,</p>

<p>Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her</p>

<p>joy.</p>

<p>And now they never meet in grove or green,</p>

<p>By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen,</p>

<p>But they do square, that all their elves for fear</p>

<p>Creep into acorn cups and hide them there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fairy</sc></p>

<p>Either I mistake your shape and making quite,</p>

<p>Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite</p>

<p>Called Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he</p>

<p>That frights the maidens of the villagery,</p>

<p>Skim milk, and sometimes labor in the quern</p>

<p>And bootless make the breathless huswife churn,</p>

<p>And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,</p>

<p>Mislead night wanderers, laughing at their harm?</p>

<p>Those that “Hobgoblin” call you and “sweet Puck,”</p>

<p>You do their work, and they shall have good luck.</p>

<p>Are not you he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc>  Thou speakest aright.</p>

<p>I am that merry wanderer of the night.</p>

<p>I jest to Oberon and make him smile</p>

<p>When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,</p>

<p>Neighing in likeness of a filly foal.</p>

<p>And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl</p>

<p>In very likeness of a roasted crab,</p>

<p>And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob</p>

<p>And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.</p>

<p>The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,</p>

<p>Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;</p>

<p>Then slip I from her bum, down topples she</p>

<p>And “Tailor!” cries and falls into a cough,</p>

<p>And then the whole choir hold their hips and loffe</p>

<p>And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear</p>

<p>A merrier hour was never wasted there.</p>

<p>But room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fairy</sc></p>

<p>And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Oberon the King of Fairies at one door, with his</p>

<p>train, and Titania the Queen at another, with hers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titania</sc></p>

<p>What, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence.</p>

<p>I have forsworn his bed and company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>Tarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titania</sc></p>

<p>Then I must be thy lady. But I know</p>

<p>When thou hast stolen away from Fairyland</p>

<p>And in the shape of Corin sat all day</p>

<p>Playing on pipes of corn and versing love</p>

<p>To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,</p>

<p>Come from the farthest steep of India,</p>

<p>But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,</p>

<p>Your buskined mistress and your warrior love,</p>

<p>To Theseus must be wedded, and you come</p>

<p>To give their bed joy and prosperity?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,</p>

<p>Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,</p>

<p>Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?</p>

<p>Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering</p>

<p>night</p>

<p>From Perigouna, whom he ravished,</p>

<p>And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,</p>

<p>With Ariadne and Antiopa?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titania</sc></p>

<p>These are the forgeries of jealousy;</p>

<p>And never, since the middle summer’s spring,</p>

<p>Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,</p>

<p>By paved fountain or by rushy brook,</p>

<p>Or in the beached margent of the sea,</p>

<p>To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,</p>

<p>But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.</p>

<p>Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</p>

<p>As in revenge have sucked up from the sea</p>

<p>Contagious fogs, which, falling in the land,</p>

<p>Hath every pelting river made so proud</p>

<p>That they have overborne their continents.</p>

<p>The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain,</p>

<p>The plowman lost his sweat, and the green corn</p>

<p>Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.</p>

<p>The fold stands empty in the drowned field,</p>

<p>And crows are fatted with the murrain flock.</p>

<p>The nine-men’s-morris is filled up with mud,</p>

<p>And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,</p>

<p>For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.</p>

<p>The human mortals want their winter here.</p>

<p>No night is now with hymn or carol blessed.</p>

<p>Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,</p>

<p>Pale in her anger, washes all the air,</p>

<p>That rheumatic diseases do abound.</p>

<p>And thorough this distemperature we see</p>

<p>The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts</p>

<p>Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,</p>

<p>And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown</p>

<p>An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</p>

<p>Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,</p>

<p>The childing autumn, angry winter, change</p>

<p>Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world</p>

<p>By their increase now knows not which is which.</p>

<p>And this same progeny of evils comes</p>

<p>From our debate, from our dissension;</p>

<p>We are their parents and original.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>Do you amend it, then. It lies in you.</p>

<p>Why should Titania cross her Oberon?</p>

<p>I do but beg a little changeling boy</p>

<p>To be my henchman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titania</sc>  Set your heart at rest:</p>

<p>The Fairyland buys not the child of me.</p>

<p>His mother was a vot’ress of my order,</p>

<p>And in the spiced Indian air by night</p>

<p>Full often hath she gossiped by my side</p>

<p>And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,</p>

<p>Marking th’ embarked traders on the flood,</p>

<p>When we have laughed to see the sails conceive</p>

<p>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</p>

<p>Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait,</p>

<p>Following (her womb then rich with my young</p>

<p>squire),</p>

<p>Would imitate and sail upon the land</p>

<p>To fetch me trifles and return again,</p>

<p>As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.</p>

<p>But she, being mortal, of that boy did die,</p>

<p>And for her sake do I rear up her boy,</p>

<p>And for her sake I will not part with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>How long within this wood intend you stay?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titania</sc></p>

<p>Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding day.</p>

<p>If you will patiently dance in our round</p>

<p>And see our moonlight revels, go with us.</p>

<p>If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>Give me that boy and I will go with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Titania</sc></p>

<p>Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.</p>

<p>We shall chide downright if I longer stay.</p>

<p><center><i>[Titania and her fairies exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove</p>

<p>Till I torment thee for this injury.–</p>

<p>My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest</p>

<p>Since once I sat upon a promontory</p>

<p>And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back</p>

<p>Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath</p>

<p>That the rude sea grew civil at her song</p>

<p>And certain stars shot madly from their spheres</p>

<p>To hear the sea-maid’s music.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc>  I remember.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>That very time I saw (but thou couldst not),</p>

<p>Flying between the cold moon and the Earth,</p>

<p>Cupid all armed. A certain aim he took</p>

<p>At a fair vestal throned by the west,</p>

<p>And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow</p>

<p>As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.</p>

<p>But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft</p>

<p>Quenched in the chaste beams of the wat’ry moon,</p>

<p>And the imperial vot’ress passed on</p>

<p>In maiden meditation, fancy-free.</p>

<p>Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.</p>

<p>It fell upon a little western flower,</p>

<p>Before, milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,</p>

<p>And maidens call it “love-in-idleness.”</p>

<p>Fetch me that flower; the herb I showed thee once.</p>

<p>The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid</p>

<p>Will make or man or woman madly dote</p>

<p>Upon the next live creature that it sees.</p>

<p>Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again</p>

<p>Ere the leviathan can swim a league.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>I’ll put a girdle round about the Earth</p>

<p>In forty minutes.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc>  Having once this juice,</p>

<p>I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep</p>

<p>And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.</p>

<p>The next thing then she, waking, looks upon</p>

<p>(Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,</p>

<p>On meddling monkey, or on busy ape)</p>

<p>She shall pursue it with the soul of love.</p>

<p>And ere I take this charm from off her sight</p>

<p>(As I can take it with another herb),</p>

<p>I’ll make her render up her page to me.</p>

<p>But who comes here? I am invisible,</p>

<p>And I will overhear their conference.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Demetrius, Helena following him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>I love thee not; therefore pursue me not.</p>

<p>Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?</p>

<p>The one I’ll stay; the other stayeth me.</p>

<p>Thou told’st me they were stol’n unto this wood,</p>

<p>And here am I, and wood within this wood</p>

<p>Because I cannot meet my Hermia.</p>

<p>Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant!</p>

<p>But yet you draw not iron, for my heart</p>

<p>Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,</p>

<p>And I shall have no power to follow you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?</p>

<p>Or rather do I not in plainest truth</p>

<p>Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>And even for that do I love you the more.</p>

<p>I am your spaniel, and, Demetrius,</p>

<p>The more you beat me I will fawn on you.</p>

<p>Use me but as your spaniel: spurn me, strike me,</p>

<p>Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave</p>

<p>(Unworthy as I am) to follow you.</p>

<p>What worser place can I beg in your love</p>

<p>(And yet a place of high respect with me)</p>

<p>Than to be used as you use your dog?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,</p>

<p>For I am sick when I do look on thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>And I am sick when I look not on you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>You do impeach your modesty too much</p>

<p>To leave the city and commit yourself</p>

<p>Into the hands of one that loves you not,</p>

<p>To trust the opportunity of night</p>

<p>And the ill counsel of a desert place</p>

<p>With the rich worth of your virginity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>Your virtue is my privilege. For that</p>

<p>It is not night when I do see your face,</p>

<p>Therefore I think I am not in the night.</p>

<p>Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,</p>

<p>For you, in my respect, are all the world.</p>

<p>Then, how can it be said I am alone</p>

<p>When all the world is here to look on me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes</p>

<p>And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>The wildest hath not such a heart as you.</p>

<p>Run when you will. The story shall be changed:</p>

<p>Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase;</p>

<p>The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind</p>

<p>Makes speed to catch the tiger. Bootless speed</p>

<p>When cowardice pursues and valor flies!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Demetrius</sc></p>

<p>I will not stay thy questions. Let me go,</p>

<p>Or if thou follow me, do not believe</p>

<p>But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Helena</sc></p>

<p>Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,</p>

<p>You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!</p>

<p>Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.</p>

<p>We cannot fight for love as men may do.</p>

<p>We should be wooed and were not made to woo.</p>

<p><center><i>[Demetrius exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell</p>

<p>To die upon the hand I love so well.     <i><i>[Helena exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc></p>

<p>Fare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove,</p>

<p>Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Robin.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>Ay, there it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oberon</sc>  I pray thee give it me.</p>

<p><center><i>[Robin gives him the flower.]</i></center></p>

<p>I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,</p>

<p>Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,</p>

<p>Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine,</p>

<p>With sweet muskroses, and with eglantine.</p>

<p>There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,</p>

<p>Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight.</p>

<p>And there the snake throws her enameled skin,</p>

<p>Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.</p>

<p>And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes</p>

<p>And make her full of hateful fantasies.</p>

<p>Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove.</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives Robin part of the flower.]</i></center></p>

<p>A sweet Athenian lady is in love</p>

<p>With a disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes,</p>

<p>But do it when the next thing he espies</p>

<p>May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man</p>

<p>By the Athenian garments he hath on.</p>

<p>Effect it with some care, that he may prove</p>

<p>More fond on her than she upon her love.</p>

<p>And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Robin</sc></p>

<p>Fear not, my lord. Your servant shall do so.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
