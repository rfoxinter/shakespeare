<p><center><i>[Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced</p>

<p>it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth</p>

<p>it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the</p>

<p>town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air</p>

<p>too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;</p>

<p>for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,</p>

<p>whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and</p>

<p>beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O,</p>

<p>it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious,</p>

<p>periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very</p>

<p>rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the</p>

<p>most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable</p>

<p>dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow</p>

<p>whipped for o’erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods</p>

<p>Herod. Pray you, avoid it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Player</sc>  I warrant your Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Be not too tame neither, but let your own</p>

<p>discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the</p>

<p>word, the word to the action, with this special</p>

<p>observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of</p>

<p>nature. For anything so o’erdone is from the purpose</p>

<p>of playing, whose end, both at the first and</p>

<p>now, was and is to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to</p>

<p>nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her</p>

<p>own image, and the very age and body of the time</p>

<p>his form and pressure. Now this overdone or come</p>

<p>tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh,</p>

<p>cannot but make the judicious grieve, the censure</p>

<p>of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh</p>

<p>a whole theater of others. O, there be players that I</p>

<p>have seen play and heard others praise (and that</p>

<p>highly), not to speak it profanely, that, neither</p>

<p>having th’ accent of Christians nor the gait of</p>

<p>Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and</p>

<p>bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s</p>

<p>journeymen had made men, and not made them</p>

<p>well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Player</sc>  I hope we have reformed that indifferently</p>

<p>with us, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  O, reform it altogether. And let those that play</p>

<p>your clowns speak no more than is set down for</p>

<p>them, for there be of them that will themselves</p>

<p>laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators</p>

<p>to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary</p>

<p>question of the play be then to be considered.</p>

<p>That’s villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition</p>

<p>in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.</p>

<p><center><i>[Players exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Polonius, Guildenstern, and Rosencrantz.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, my lord, will the King hear this piece of</p>

<p>work?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  And the Queen too, and that presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Bid the players make haste.     <i><i>[Polonius exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Will you two help to hasten them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Ay, my lord.     <i><i>[They exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  What ho, Horatio!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Horatio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Here, sweet lord, at your service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Horatio, thou art e’en as just a man</p>

<p>As e’er my conversation coped withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>O, my dear lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Nay, do not think I flatter,</p>

<p>For what advancement may I hope from thee</p>

<p>That no revenue hast but thy good spirits</p>

<p>To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be</p>

<p>flattered?</p>

<p>No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp</p>

<p>And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee</p>

<p>Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?</p>

<p>Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice</p>

<p>And could of men distinguish, her election</p>

<p>Hath sealed thee for herself. For thou hast been</p>

<p>As one in suffering all that suffers nothing,</p>

<p>A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards</p>

<p>Hast ta’en with equal thanks; and blessed are those</p>

<p>Whose blood and judgment are so well</p>

<p>commeddled</p>

<p>That they are not a pipe for Fortune’s finger</p>

<p>To sound what stop she please. Give me that man</p>

<p>That is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him</p>

<p>In my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart,</p>

<p>As I do thee.–Something too much of this.–</p>

<p>There is a play tonight before the King.</p>

<p>One scene of it comes near the circumstance</p>

<p>Which I have told thee of my father’s death.</p>

<p>I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,</p>

<p>Even with the very comment of thy soul</p>

<p>Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt</p>

<p>Do not itself unkennel in one speech,</p>

<p>It is a damned ghost that we have seen,</p>

<p>And my imaginations are as foul</p>

<p>As Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note,</p>

<p>For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,</p>

<p>And, after, we will both our judgments join</p>

<p>In censure of his seeming.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Well, my lord.</p>

<p>If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing</p>

<p>And ’scape detecting, I will pay the theft.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sound a flourish.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  They are coming to the play. I must be idle.</p>

<p>Get you a place.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Trumpets and Kettle Drums. Enter King, Queen,</p>

<p>Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and other</p>

<p>Lords attendant with the King’s guard carrying</p>

<p>torches.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  How fares our cousin Hamlet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Excellent, i’ faith, of the chameleon’s dish. I</p>

<p>eat the air, promise-crammed. You cannot feed</p>

<p>capons so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These</p>

<p>words are not mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  No, nor mine now. <i>[To Polonius.]</i> My lord, you</p>

<p>played once i’ th’ university, you say?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  That did I, my lord, and was accounted a</p>

<p>good actor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  What did you enact?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed i’ th’</p>

<p>Capitol. Brutus killed me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a</p>

<p>calf there.–Be the players ready?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Ay, my lord. They stay upon your</p>

<p>patience.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  No, good mother. Here’s metal more</p>

<p>attractive.     <i><i>[Hamlet takes a place near Ophelia.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc> <i>[to the King]</i>  Oh, ho! Do you mark that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Lady, shall I lie in your lap?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  No, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I mean, my head upon your lap?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Ay, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Do you think I meant country matters?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  I think nothing, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’</p>

<p>legs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  What is, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  You are merry, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Who, I?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Ay, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  O God, your only jig-maker. What should a</p>

<p>man do but be merry? For look you how cheerfully</p>

<p>my mother looks, and my father died within ’s two</p>

<p>hours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black,</p>

<p>for I’ll have a suit of sables. O heavens, die two</p>

<p>months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there’s</p>

<p>hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half</p>

<p>a year. But, by ’r Lady, he must build churches, then,</p>

<p>or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the</p>

<p>hobby-horse, whose epitaph is “For oh, for oh, the</p>

<p>hobby-horse is forgot.”</p>

<p><center><i>[The trumpets sounds. Dumb show follows.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a King and a Queen, very lovingly, the Queen</p>

<p>embracing him and he her. She kneels and makes show of</p>

<p>protestation unto him. He takes her up and declines his</p>

<p>flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon</p>

<p>comes in another man, takes off his crown, kisses it, pours</p>

<p>poison in the sleeper’s ears, and leaves him. The Queen</p>

<p>poisoner with some three or four come in again, seem to</p>

<p>condole with her. The dead body is carried away. The</p>

<p><center><i>[Players exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  What means this, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Marry, this is miching mallecho. It means</p>

<p>mischief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Belike this show imports the argument of the</p>

<p>play.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Prologue.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  We shall know by this fellow. The players</p>

<p>cannot keep counsel; they’ll tell all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Will he tell us what this show meant?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Ay, or any show that you will show him. Be</p>

<p>not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you</p>

<p>what it means.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  You are naught, you are naught. I’ll mark the</p>

<p>play.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Prologue</sc></p>

<p>     <i>For us and for our tragedy,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Here stooping to your clemency,</i></p>

<p>     We beg your hearing patiently.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  ’Tis brief, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  As woman’s love.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Player King and Queen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Player</sc> <sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Full thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart gone round</p>

<p>Neptune’s salt wash and Tellus’ orbed ground,</p>

<p>And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen</p>

<p>About the world have times twelve thirties been</p>

<p>Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands</p>

<p>Unite commutual in most sacred bands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Player</sc> <sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>So many journeys may the sun and moon</p>

<p>Make us again count o’er ere love be done!</p>

<p>But woe is me! You are so sick of late,</p>

<p>So far from cheer and from your former state,</p>

<p>That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,</p>

<p>Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must.</p>

<p>For women fear too much, even as they love,</p>

<p>And women’s fear and love hold quantity,</p>

<p>In neither aught, or in extremity.</p>

<p>Now what my love is, proof hath made you know,</p>

<p>And, as my love is sized, my fear is so:</p>

<p>Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;</p>

<p>Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Player</sc> <sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too.</p>

<p>My operant powers their functions leave to do.</p>

<p>And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,</p>

<p>Honored, beloved; and haply one as kind</p>

<p>For husband shalt thou–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Player</sc> <sc>Queen</sc>  O, confound the rest!</p>

<p>Such love must needs be treason in my breast.</p>

<p>In second husband let me be accurst.</p>

<p>None wed the second but who killed the first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  That’s wormwood!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Player</sc> <sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>The instances that second marriage move</p>

<p>Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.</p>

<p>A second time I kill my husband dead</p>

<p>When second husband kisses me in bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Player</sc> <sc>King</sc></p>

<p>I do believe you think what now you speak,</p>

<p>But what we do determine oft we break.</p>

<p>Purpose is but the slave to memory,</p>

<p>Of violent birth, but poor validity,</p>

<p>Which now, the fruit unripe, sticks on the tree</p>

<p>But fall unshaken when they mellow be.</p>

<p>Most necessary ’tis that we forget</p>

<p>To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.</p>

<p>What to ourselves in passion we propose,</p>

<p>The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.</p>

<p>The violence of either grief or joy</p>

<p>Their own enactures with themselves destroy.</p>

<p>Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;</p>

<p>Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.</p>

<p>This world is not for aye, nor ’tis not strange</p>

<p>That even our loves should with our fortunes change;</p>

<p>For ’tis a question left us yet to prove</p>

<p>Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love.</p>

<p>The great man down, you mark his favorite flies;</p>

<p>The poor, advanced, makes friends of enemies.</p>

<p>And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,</p>

<p>For who not needs shall never lack a friend,</p>

<p>And who in want a hollow friend doth try</p>

<p>Directly seasons him his enemy.</p>

<p>But, orderly to end where I begun:</p>

<p>Our wills and fates do so contrary run</p>

<p>That our devices still are overthrown;</p>

<p>Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.</p>

<p>So think thou wilt no second husband wed,</p>

<p>But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Player</sc> <sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Nor Earth to me give food, nor heaven light,</p>

<p>Sport and repose lock from me day and night,</p>

<p>To desperation turn my trust and hope,</p>

<p>An anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope.</p>

<p>Each opposite that blanks the face of joy</p>

<p>Meet what I would have well and it destroy.</p>

<p>Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,</p>

<p>If, once a widow, ever I be wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  If she should break it now!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Player</sc> <sc>King</sc></p>

<p>’Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.</p>

<p>My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile</p>

<p>The tedious day with sleep.     <i><i>[Sleeps.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Player</sc> <sc>Queen</sc>  Sleep rock thy brain,</p>

<p>And never come mischance between us twain.</p>

<p><center><i>[Player Queen exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Madam, how like you this play?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  The lady doth protest too much, methinks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  O, but she’ll keep her word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Have you heard the argument? Is there no</p>

<p>offense in ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest. No</p>

<p>offense i’ th’ world.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  What do you call the play?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  “The Mousetrap.” Marry, how? Tropically.</p>

<p>This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna.</p>

<p>Gonzago is the duke’s name, his wife Baptista. You</p>

<p>shall see anon. ’Tis a knavish piece of work, but</p>

<p>what of that? Your Majesty and we that have free</p>

<p>souls, it touches us not. Let the galled jade wince;</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  No, my lord, with choler.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Your wisdom should show itself more richer</p>

<p>to signify this to the doctor, for for me to put him to</p>

<p>his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more</p>

<p>choler.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  Good my lord, put your discourse into</p>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  You are welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not</p>

<p>of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me</p>

<p>a wholesome answer, I will do your mother’s</p>

<p>commandment. If not, your pardon and my return</p>

<p>shall be the end of my business.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Sir, I cannot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  What, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Make you a wholesome answer. My wit’s</p>

<p>diseased. But, sir, such answer as I can make, you</p>

<p>shall command–or, rather, as you say, my mother.</p>

<p>Therefore no more but to the matter. My mother,</p>

<p>you say–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Then thus she says: your behavior hath</p>

<p>struck her into amazement and admiration.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  O wonderful son that can so ’stonish a mother!</p>

<p>But is there no sequel at the heels of this</p>

<p>mother’s admiration? Impart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  She desires to speak with you in her</p>

<p>closet ere you go to bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.</p>

<p>Have you any further trade with us?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  My lord, you once did love me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  And do still, by these pickers and stealers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Good my lord, what is your cause of</p>

<p>distemper? You do surely bar the door upon your</p>

<p>own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Sir, I lack advancement.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  How can that be, when you have the</p>

<p>voice of the King himself for your succession in</p>

<p>Denmark?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Ay, sir, but “While the grass grows”–the</p>

<p>proverb is something musty.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Players with recorders.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O, the recorders! Let me see one. <i>[He takes a</p>

<p>recorder and turns to Guildenstern.]</i> To withdraw</p>

<p>with you: why do you go about to recover the wind</p>

<p>of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my</p>

<p>love is too unmannerly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I do not well understand that. Will you play</p>

<p>upon this pipe?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  My lord, I cannot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I pray you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  Believe me, I cannot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I do beseech you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  I know no touch of it, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages</p>

<p>with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with</p>

<p>your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent</p>

<p>music. Look you, these are the stops.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  But these cannot I command to any</p>

<p>utt’rance of harmony. I have not the skill.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing</p>

<p>you make of me! You would play upon me, you</p>

<p>would seem to know my stops, you would pluck</p>

<p>out the heart of my mystery, you would sound me</p>

<p>from my lowest note to the top of my compass;</p>

<p>and there is much music, excellent voice, in this</p>

<p>little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. ’Sblood,</p>

<p>do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?</p>

<p>Call me what instrument you will, though you can</p>

<p>fret me, you cannot play upon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Polonius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>God bless you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  My lord, the Queen would speak with you,</p>

<p>and presently.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in</p>

<p>shape of a camel?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  By th’ Mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Methinks it is like a weasel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  It is backed like a weasel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Or like a whale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  Very like a whale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Then I will come to my mother by and by.</p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> They fool me to the top of my bent.–I will</p>

<p>come by and by.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  I will say so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  “By and by” is easily said. Leave me,</p>

<p>friends.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Hamlet exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>’Tis now the very witching time of night,</p>

<p>When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes</p>

<p>out</p>

<p>Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot</p>

<p>blood</p>

<p>And do such bitter business as the day</p>

<p>Would quake to look on. Soft, now to my mother.</p>

<p>O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever</p>

<p>The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.</p>

<p>Let me be cruel, not unnatural.</p>

<p>I will speak daggers to her, but use none.</p>

<p>My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites:</p>

<p>How in my words somever she be shent,</p>

<p>To give them seals never, my soul, consent.</p>
