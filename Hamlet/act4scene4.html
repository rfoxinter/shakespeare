<p><center><i>[Enter Fortinbras with his army over the stage.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fortinbras</sc></p>

<p>Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.</p>

<p>Tell him that by his license Fortinbras</p>

<p>Craves the conveyance of a promised march</p>

<p>Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.</p>

<p>If that his Majesty would aught with us,</p>

<p>We shall express our duty in his eye;</p>

<p>And let him know so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc>  I will do ’t, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fortinbras</sc>  Go softly on.     <i><i>[All but the Captain exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Good sir, whose powers are these?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc>  They are of Norway, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  How purposed, sir, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc>  Against some part of Poland.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Who commands them, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,</p>

<p>Or for some frontier?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>Truly to speak, and with no addition,</p>

<p>We go to gain a little patch of ground</p>

<p>That hath in it no profit but the name.</p>

<p>To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;</p>

<p>Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole</p>

<p>A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Why, then, the Polack never will defend it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>Yes, it is already garrisoned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats</p>

<p>Will not debate the question of this straw.</p>

<p>This is th’ impostume of much wealth and peace,</p>

<p>That inward breaks and shows no cause without</p>

<p>Why the man dies.–I humbly thank you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc>  God be wi’ you, sir.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Will ’t please you go, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>I’ll be with you straight. Go a little before.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Hamlet exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>How all occasions do inform against me</p>

<p>And spur my dull revenge. What is a man</p>

<p>If his chief good and market of his time</p>

<p>Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.</p>

<p>Sure He that made us with such large discourse,</p>

<p>Looking before and after, gave us not</p>

<p>That capability and godlike reason</p>

<p>To fust in us unused. Now whether it be</p>

<p>Bestial oblivion or some craven scruple</p>

<p>Of thinking too precisely on th’ event</p>

<p>(A thought which, quartered, hath but one part</p>

<p>wisdom</p>

<p>And ever three parts coward), I do not know</p>

<p>Why yet I live to say “This thing’s to do,”</p>

<p>Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means</p>

<p>To do ’t. Examples gross as Earth exhort me:</p>

<p>Witness this army of such mass and charge,</p>

<p>Led by a delicate and tender prince,</p>

<p>Whose spirit with divine ambition puffed</p>

<p>Makes mouths at the invisible event,</p>

<p>Exposing what is mortal and unsure</p>

<p>To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,</p>

<p>Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great</p>

<p>Is not to stir without great argument,</p>

<p>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw</p>

<p>When honor’s at the stake. How stand I, then,</p>

<p>That have a father killed, a mother stained,</p>

<p>Excitements of my reason and my blood,</p>

<p>And let all sleep, while to my shame I see</p>

<p>The imminent death of twenty thousand men</p>

<p>That for a fantasy and trick of fame</p>

<p>Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot</p>

<p>Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,</p>

<p>Which is not tomb enough and continent</p>

<p>To hide the slain? O, from this time forth</p>

<p>My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth!</p>
