<p><center><i>[Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,</p>

<p>Guildenstern, and Lords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>And can you by no drift of conference</p>

<p>Get from him why he puts on this confusion,</p>

<p>Grating so harshly all his days of quiet</p>

<p>With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc></p>

<p>He does confess he feels himself distracted,</p>

<p>But from what cause he will by no means speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc></p>

<p>Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,</p>

<p>But with a crafty madness keeps aloof</p>

<p>When we would bring him on to some confession</p>

<p>Of his true state.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Did he receive you well?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Most like a gentleman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc></p>

<p>But with much forcing of his disposition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc></p>

<p>Niggard of question, but of our demands</p>

<p>Most free in his reply.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Did you assay him to any pastime?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc></p>

<p>Madam, it so fell out that certain players</p>

<p>We o’erraught on the way. Of these we told him,</p>

<p>And there did seem in him a kind of joy</p>

<p>To hear of it. They are here about the court,</p>

<p>And, as I think, they have already order</p>

<p>This night to play before him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  ’Tis most true,</p>

<p>And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties</p>

<p>To hear and see the matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>With all my heart, and it doth much content me</p>

<p>To hear him so inclined.</p>

<p>Good gentlemen, give him a further edge</p>

<p>And drive his purpose into these delights.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc></p>

<p>We shall, my lord.     <i><i>[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</i></p>

<p>and Lords exit.]</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,</p>

<p>For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,</p>

<p>That he, as ’twere by accident, may here</p>

<p>Affront Ophelia.</p>

<p>Her father and myself, lawful espials,</p>

<p>Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,</p>

<p>We may of their encounter frankly judge</p>

<p>And gather by him, as he is behaved,</p>

<p>If ’t be th’ affliction of his love or no</p>

<p>That thus he suffers for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  I shall obey you.</p>

<p>And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish</p>

<p>That your good beauties be the happy cause</p>

<p>Of Hamlet’s wildness. So shall I hope your virtues</p>

<p>Will bring him to his wonted way again,</p>

<p>To both your honors.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Madam, I wish it may.</p>

<p><center><i>[Queen exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Ophelia, walk you here.–Gracious, so please you,</p>

<p>We will bestow ourselves. <i>[To Ophelia.]</i> Read on this</p>

<p>book,</p>

<p>That show of such an exercise may color</p>

<p>Your loneliness.–We are oft to blame in this</p>

<p>(’Tis too much proved), that with devotion’s visage</p>

<p>And pious action we do sugar o’er</p>

<p>The devil himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  O, ’tis too true!</p>

<p>How smart a lash that speech doth give my</p>

<p>conscience.</p>

<p>The harlot’s cheek beautied with plast’ring art</p>

<p>Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it</p>

<p>Than is my deed to my most painted word.</p>

<p>O heavy burden!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>I hear him coming. Let’s withdraw, my lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[They withdraw.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hamlet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>To be or not to be–that is the question:</p>

<p>Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>

<p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>

<p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles</p>

<p>And, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep–</p>

<p>No more–and by a sleep to say we end</p>

<p>The heartache and the thousand natural shocks</p>

<p>That flesh is heir to–’tis a consummation</p>

<p>Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep–</p>

<p>To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there’s the rub,</p>

<p>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,</p>

<p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p>

<p>Must give us pause. There’s the respect</p>

<p>That makes calamity of so long life.</p>

<p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</p>

<p>Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,</p>

<p>The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,</p>

<p>The insolence of office, and the spurns</p>

<p>That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,</p>

<p>When he himself might his quietus make</p>

<p>With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,</p>

<p>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</p>

<p>But that the dread of something after death,</p>

<p>The undiscovered country from whose bourn</p>

<p>No traveler returns, puzzles the will</p>

<p>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</p>

<p>Than fly to others that we know not of?</p>

<p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</p>

<p>And thus the native hue of resolution</p>

<p>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,</p>

<p>And enterprises of great pitch and moment</p>

<p>With this regard their currents turn awry</p>

<p>And lose the name of action.–Soft you now,</p>

<p>The fair Ophelia.–Nymph, in thy orisons</p>

<p>Be all my sins remembered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Good my lord,</p>

<p>How does your Honor for this many a day?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I humbly thank you, well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I have remembrances of yours</p>

<p>That I have longed long to redeliver.</p>

<p>I pray you now receive them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>No, not I. I never gave you aught.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc></p>

<p>My honored lord, you know right well you did,</p>

<p>And with them words of so sweet breath composed</p>

<p>As made the things more rich. Their perfume</p>

<p>lost,</p>

<p>Take these again, for to the noble mind</p>

<p>Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.</p>

<p>There, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Ha, ha, are you honest?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  My lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Are you fair?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  What means your Lordship?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  That if you be honest and fair, your honesty</p>

<p>should admit no discourse to your beauty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce</p>

<p>than with honesty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner</p>

<p>transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than</p>

<p>the force of honesty can translate beauty into his</p>

<p>likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now</p>

<p>the time gives it proof. I did love you once.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  You should not have believed me, for virtue</p>

<p>cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall</p>

<p>relish of it. I loved you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  I was the more deceived.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be</p>

<p>a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest,</p>

<p>but yet I could accuse me of such things that it</p>

<p>were better my mother had not borne me: I am</p>

<p>very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses</p>

<p>at my beck than I have thoughts to put them</p>

<p>in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act</p>

<p>them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling</p>

<p>between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves</p>

<p>all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.</p>

<p>Where’s your father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  At home, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Let the doors be shut upon him that he may</p>

<p>play the fool nowhere but in ’s own house. Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  O, help him, you sweet heavens!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague</p>

<p>for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as</p>

<p>snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a</p>

<p>nunnery, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry,</p>

<p>marry a fool, for wise men know well enough what</p>

<p>monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and</p>

<p>quickly too. Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Heavenly powers, restore him!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I have heard of your paintings too, well</p>

<p>enough. God hath given you one face, and you</p>

<p>make yourselves another. You jig and amble, and</p>

<p>you lisp; you nickname God’s creatures and make</p>

<p>your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no</p>

<p>more on ’t. It hath made me mad. I say we will have</p>

<p>no more marriage. Those that are married already,</p>

<p>all but one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.</p>

<p>To a nunnery, go.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc></p>

<p>O, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!</p>

<p>The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue,</p>

<p>sword,</p>

<p>Th’ expectancy and rose of the fair state,</p>

<p>The glass of fashion and the mold of form,</p>

<p>Th’ observed of all observers, quite, quite down!</p>

<p>And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,</p>

<p>That sucked the honey of his musicked vows,</p>

<p>Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,</p>

<p>Like sweet bells jangled, out of time and harsh;</p>

<p>That unmatched form and stature of blown youth</p>

<p>Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me</p>

<p>T’ have seen what I have seen, see what I see!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[advancing with Polonius]</i></p>

<p>Love? His affections do not that way tend;</p>

<p>Nor what he spake, though it lacked form a little,</p>

<p>Was not like madness. There’s something in his soul</p>

<p>O’er which his melancholy sits on brood,</p>

<p>And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose</p>

<p>Will be some danger; which for to prevent,</p>

<p>I have in quick determination</p>

<p>Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England</p>

<p>For the demand of our neglected tribute.</p>

<p>Haply the seas, and countries different,</p>

<p>With variable objects, shall expel</p>

<p>This something-settled matter in his heart,</p>

<p>Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus</p>

<p>From fashion of himself. What think you on ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>It shall do well. But yet do I believe</p>

<p>The origin and commencement of his grief</p>

<p>Sprung from neglected love.–How now, Ophelia?</p>

<p>You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;</p>

<p>We heard it all.–My lord, do as you please,</p>

<p>But, if you hold it fit, after the play</p>

<p>Let his queen-mother all alone entreat him</p>

<p>To show his grief. Let her be round with him;</p>

<p>And I’ll be placed, so please you, in the ear</p>

<p>Of all their conference. If she find him not,</p>

<p>To England send him, or confine him where</p>

<p>Your wisdom best shall think.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  It shall be so.</p>

<p>Madness in great ones must not unwatched go.</p>
