<p><center><i>[Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>I like him not, nor stands it safe with us</p>

<p>To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you.</p>

<p>I your commission will forthwith dispatch,</p>

<p>And he to England shall along with you.</p>

<p>The terms of our estate may not endure</p>

<p>Hazard so near ’s as doth hourly grow</p>

<p>Out of his brows.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Guildenstern</span>  We will ourselves provide.</p>

<p>Most holy and religious fear it is</p>

<p>To keep those many many bodies safe</p>

<p>That live and feed upon your Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosencrantz</span></p>

<p>The single and peculiar life is bound</p>

<p>With all the strength and armor of the mind</p>

<p>To keep itself from noyance, but much more</p>

<p>That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests</p>

<p>The lives of many. The cess of majesty</p>

<p>Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw</p>

<p>What’s near it with it; or it is a massy wheel</p>

<p>Fixed on the summit of the highest mount,</p>

<p>To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things</p>

<p>Are mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls,</p>

<p>Each small annexment, petty consequence,</p>

<p>Attends the boist’rous ruin. Never alone</p>

<p>Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage,</p>

<p>For we will fetters put about this fear,</p>

<p>Which now goes too free-footed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosencrantz</span>  We will haste us.</p>

<p><center><i>[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Polonius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span></p>

<p>My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.</p>

<p>Behind the arras I’ll convey myself</p>

<p>To hear the process. I’ll warrant she’ll tax him</p>

<p>home;</p>

<p>And, as you said (and wisely was it said),</p>

<p>’Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,</p>

<p>Since nature makes them partial, should o’erhear</p>

<p>The speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.</p>

<p>I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed</p>

<p>And tell you what I know.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Thanks, dear my lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[Polonius exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven;</p>

<p>It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t,</p>

<p>A brother’s murder. Pray can I not,</p>

<p>Though inclination be as sharp as will.</p>

<p>My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,</p>

<p>And, like a man to double business bound,</p>

<p>I stand in pause where I shall first begin</p>

<p>And both neglect. What if this cursed hand</p>

<p>Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood?</p>

<p>Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens</p>

<p>To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy</p>

<p>But to confront the visage of offense?</p>

<p>And what’s in prayer but this twofold force,</p>

<p>To be forestalled ere we come to fall,</p>

<p>Or pardoned being down? Then I’ll look up.</p>

<p>My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer</p>

<p>Can serve my turn? “Forgive me my foul murder”?</p>

<p>That cannot be, since I am still possessed</p>

<p>Of those effects for which I did the murder:</p>

<p>My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.</p>

<p>May one be pardoned and retain th’ offense?</p>

<p>In the corrupted currents of this world,</p>

<p>Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice,</p>

<p>And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself</p>

<p>Buys out the law. But ’tis not so above:</p>

<p>There is no shuffling; there the action lies</p>

<p>In his true nature, and we ourselves compelled,</p>

<p>Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,</p>

<p>To give in evidence. What then? What rests?</p>

<p>Try what repentance can. What can it not?</p>

<p>Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?</p>

<p>O wretched state! O bosom black as death!</p>

<p>O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,</p>

<p>Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay.</p>

<p>Bow, stubborn knees, and heart with strings of steel</p>

<p>Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe.</p>

<p>All may be well.     <i><i>[He kneels.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hamlet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>Now might I do it pat, now he is a-praying,</p>

<p>And now I’ll do ’t.     <i><i>[He draws his sword.]</i></i></p>

<p>And so he goes to heaven,</p>

<p>And so am I revenged. That would be scanned:</p>

<p>A villain kills my father, and for that,</p>

<p>I, his sole son, do this same villain send</p>

<p>To heaven.</p>

<p>Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge.</p>

<p>He took my father grossly, full of bread,</p>

<p>With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;</p>

<p>And how his audit stands who knows save heaven.</p>

<p>But in our circumstance and course of thought</p>

<p>’Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged</p>

<p>To take him in the purging of his soul,</p>

<p>When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Up sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.</p>

<p><center><i>[He sheathes his sword.]</i></center></p>

<p>When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,</p>

<p>Or in th’ incestuous pleasure of his bed,</p>

<p>At game, a-swearing, or about some act</p>

<p>That has no relish of salvation in ’t–</p>

<p>Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,</p>

<p>And that his soul may be as damned and black</p>

<p>As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.</p>

<p>This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.</p>

<p><center><i>[Hamlet exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[rising]</i></p>

<p>My words fly up, my thoughts remain below;</p>

<p>Words without thoughts never to heaven go.</p>
