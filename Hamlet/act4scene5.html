<p><center><i>[Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  I will not speak with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  She is importunate,</p>

<p>Indeed distract; her mood will needs be pitied.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  What would she have?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>She speaks much of her father, says she hears</p>

<p>There’s tricks i’ th’ world, and hems, and beats her</p>

<p>heart,</p>

<p>Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt</p>

<p>That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,</p>

<p>Yet the unshaped use of it doth move</p>

<p>The hearers to collection. They aim at it</p>

<p>And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;</p>

<p>Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield</p>

<p>them,</p>

<p>Indeed would make one think there might be</p>

<p>thought,</p>

<p>Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>’Twere good she were spoken with, for she may</p>

<p>strew</p>

<p>Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Let her come in.     <i><i>[Gentleman exits.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[Aside.]</i> To my sick soul (as sin’s true nature is),</p>

<p>Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.</p>

<p>So full of artless jealousy is guilt,</p>

<p>It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ophelia distracted.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc></p>

<p>Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  How now, Ophelia?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>How should I your true love know</i></p>

<p>        <i>From another one?</i></p>

<p>     <i>By his cockle hat and staff</i></p>

<p>        <i>And his sandal shoon.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Say you? Nay, pray you, mark.</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>He is dead and gone, lady,</i></p>

<p>        <i>He is dead and gone;</i></p>

<p>     <i>At his head a grass-green turf,</i></p>

<p>        <i>At his heels a stone.</i></p>

<p>Oh, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Nay, but Ophelia–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Pray you, mark.</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>White his shroud as the mountain snow–</i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Alas, look here, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>        <i>Larded all with sweet flowers;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Which bewept to the ground did not go</i></p>

<p>        <i>With true-love showers.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  How do you, pretty lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Well, God dild you. They say the owl was a</p>

<p>baker’s daughter. Lord, we know what we are but</p>

<p>know not what we may be. God be at your table.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Conceit upon her father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Pray let’s have no words of this, but when</p>

<p>they ask you what it means, say you this:</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day,</i></p>

<p>        <i>All in the morning betime,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And I a maid at your window,</i></p>

<p>        <i>To be your Valentine.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Then up he rose and donned his clothes</i></p>

<p>        <i>And dupped the chamber door,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Let in the maid, that out a maid</i></p>

<p>        <i>Never departed more.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Pretty Ophelia–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc></p>

<p>Indeed, without an oath, I’ll make an end on ’t:</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>By Gis and by Saint Charity,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Alack and fie for shame,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Young men will do ’t, if they come to ’t;</i></p>

<p>        <i>By Cock, they are to blame.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Quoth she “Before you tumbled me,</i></p>

<p>        <i>You promised me to wed.”</i></p>

<p>He answers:</p>

<p>     <i>“So would I ’a done, by yonder sun,</i></p>

<p>        <i>An thou hadst not come to my bed.”</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  How long hath she been thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  I hope all will be well. We must be patient,</p>

<p>but I cannot choose but weep to think they would</p>

<p>lay him i’ th’ cold ground. My brother shall know of</p>

<p>it. And so I thank you for your good counsel. Come,</p>

<p>my coach! Good night, ladies, good night, sweet</p>

<p>ladies, good night, good night.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Horatio exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>O, this is the poison of deep grief. It springs</p>

<p>All from her father’s death, and now behold!</p>

<p>O Gertrude, Gertrude,</p>

<p>When sorrows come, they come not single spies,</p>

<p>But in battalions: first, her father slain;</p>

<p>Next, your son gone, and he most violent author</p>

<p>Of his own just remove; the people muddied,</p>

<p>Thick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and</p>

<p>whispers</p>

<p>For good Polonius’ death, and we have done but</p>

<p>greenly</p>

<p>In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia</p>

<p>Divided from herself and her fair judgment,</p>

<p>Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;</p>

<p>Last, and as much containing as all these,</p>

<p>Her brother is in secret come from France,</p>

<p>Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,</p>

<p>And wants not buzzers to infect his ear</p>

<p>With pestilent speeches of his father’s death,</p>

<p>Wherein necessity, of matter beggared,</p>

<p>Will nothing stick our person to arraign</p>

<p>In ear and ear. O, my dear Gertrude, this,</p>

<p>Like to a murd’ring piece, in many places</p>

<p>Gives me superfluous death.</p>

<p><center><i>[A noise within.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Alack, what noise is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Attend!</p>

<p>Where is my Switzers? Let them guard the door.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What is the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  Save yourself, my lord.</p>

<p>The ocean, overpeering of his list,</p>

<p>Eats not the flats with more impiteous haste</p>

<p>Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,</p>

<p>O’erbears your officers. The rabble call him “lord,”</p>

<p>And, as the world were now but to begin,</p>

<p>Antiquity forgot, custom not known,</p>

<p>The ratifiers and props of every word,</p>

<p>They cry “Choose we, Laertes shall be king!”</p>

<p>Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,</p>

<p>“Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!”</p>

<p><center><i>[A noise within.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>How cheerfully on the false trail they cry.</p>

<p>O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  The doors are broke.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Laertes with others.</p>

<p>]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>Where is this king?–Sirs, stand you all without.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  No, let’s come in!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  I pray you, give me leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  We will, we will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>I thank you. Keep the door. <i>[Followers exit.]</i> O, thou</p>

<p>vile king,</p>

<p>Give me my father!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Calmly, good Laertes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me</p>

<p>bastard,</p>

<p>Cries “cuckold” to my father, brands the harlot</p>

<p>Even here between the chaste unsmirched brow</p>

<p>Of my true mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  What is the cause, Laertes,</p>

<p>That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?–</p>

<p>Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.</p>

<p>There’s such divinity doth hedge a king</p>

<p>That treason can but peep to what it would,</p>

<p>Acts little of his will.–Tell me, Laertes,</p>

<p>Why thou art thus incensed.–Let him go,</p>

<p>Gertrude.–</p>

<p>Speak, man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  Where is my father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>But not by him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Let him demand his fill.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>How came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with.</p>

<p>To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!</p>

<p>Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!</p>

<p>I dare damnation. To this point I stand,</p>

<p>That both the worlds I give to negligence,</p>

<p>Let come what comes, only I’ll be revenged</p>

<p>Most throughly for my father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Who shall stay you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  My will, not all the world.</p>

<p>And for my means, I’ll husband them so well</p>

<p>They shall go far with little.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Good Laertes,</p>

<p>If you desire to know the certainty</p>

<p>Of your dear father, is ’t writ in your revenge</p>

<p>That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and</p>

<p>foe,</p>

<p>Winner and loser?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  None but his enemies.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Will you know them, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>To his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my arms</p>

<p>And, like the kind life-rend’ring pelican,</p>

<p>Repast them with my blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Why, now you speak</p>

<p>Like a good child and a true gentleman.</p>

<p>That I am guiltless of your father’s death</p>

<p>And am most sensibly in grief for it,</p>

<p>It shall as level to your judgment ’pear</p>

<p>As day does to your eye.</p>

<br/>

<p>  <i>[A noise within:]</i> “Let her come in!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  How now, what noise is that?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ophelia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt</p>

<p>Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!</p>

<p>By heaven, thy madness shall be paid with weight</p>

<p>Till our scale turn the beam! O rose of May,</p>

<p>Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!</p>

<p>O heavens, is ’t possible a young maid’s wits</p>

<p>Should be as mortal as an old man’s life?</p>

<p>Nature is fine in love, and, where ’tis fine,</p>

<p>It sends some precious instance of itself</p>

<p>After the thing it loves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>They bore him barefaced on the bier,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And in his grave rained many a tear.</i></p>

<p>Fare you well, my dove.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge,</p>

<p>It could not move thus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  You must sing “A-down a-down”–and you</p>

<p>“Call him a-down-a.”–O, how the wheel becomes</p>

<p>it! It is the false steward that stole his master’s</p>

<p>daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  This nothing’s more than matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance.</p>

<p>Pray you, love, remember. And there is pansies,</p>

<p>that’s for thoughts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  A document in madness: thoughts and remembrance</p>

<p>fitted.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  There’s fennel for you, and columbines.</p>

<p>There’s rue for you, and here’s some for me; we</p>

<p>may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. You must wear</p>

<p>your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy. I would</p>

<p>give you some violets, but they withered all when</p>

<p>my father died. They say he made a good end.</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i> For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>Thought and afflictions, passion, hell itself</p>

<p>She turns to favor and to prettiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>And will he not come again?</i></p>

<p>     <i>And will he not come again?</i></p>

<p>        <i>No, no, he is dead.</i></p>

<p>        <i>Go to thy deathbed.</i></p>

<p>     <i>He never will come again.</i></p>

<br/>

<p>     <i>His beard was as white as snow,</i></p>

<p>     <i>All flaxen was his poll.</i></p>

<p>        <i>He is gone, he is gone,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And we cast away moan.</i></p>

<p>     <i>God ’a mercy on his soul.</i></p>

<p>And of all Christians’ souls, I pray God. God be wi’</p>

<p>you.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  Do you see this, O God?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Laertes, I must commune with your grief,</p>

<p>Or you deny me right. Go but apart,</p>

<p>Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,</p>

<p>And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me.</p>

<p>If by direct or by collateral hand</p>

<p>They find us touched, we will our kingdom give,</p>

<p>Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,</p>

<p>To you in satisfaction; but if not,</p>

<p>Be you content to lend your patience to us,</p>

<p>And we shall jointly labor with your soul</p>

<p>To give it due content.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  Let this be so.</p>

<p>His means of death, his obscure funeral</p>

<p>(No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o’er his bones,</p>

<p>No noble rite nor formal ostentation)</p>

<p>Cry to be heard, as ’twere from heaven to earth,</p>

<p>That I must call ’t in question.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  So you shall,</p>

<p>And where th’ offense is, let the great ax fall.</p>

<p>I pray you, go with me.</p>
