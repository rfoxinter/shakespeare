<p><center><i>[Enter Barnardo and Francisco, two sentinels.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc>  Who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francisco</sc></p>

<p>Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc>  Long live the King!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francisco</sc>  Barnardo?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc>  He.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francisco</sc></p>

<p>You come most carefully upon your hour.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc></p>

<p>’Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francisco</sc></p>

<p>For this relief much thanks. ’Tis bitter cold,</p>

<p>And I am sick at heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc>  Have you had quiet guard?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francisco</sc>  Not a mouse stirring.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc>  Well, good night.</p>

<p>If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,</p>

<p>The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francisco</sc></p>

<p>I think I hear them.–Stand ho! Who is there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Friends to this ground.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  And liegemen to the Dane.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francisco</sc>  Give you good night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>O farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved</p>

<p>you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Francisco</sc></p>

<p>Barnardo hath my place. Give you good night.</p>

<p><center><i>[Francisco exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  Holla, Barnardo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc>  Say, what, is Horatio there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  A piece of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc></p>

<p>Welcome, Horatio.–Welcome, good Marcellus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>What, has this thing appeared again tonight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc>  I have seen nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy</p>

<p>And will not let belief take hold of him</p>

<p>Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.</p>

<p>Therefore I have entreated him along</p>

<p>With us to watch the minutes of this night,</p>

<p>That, if again this apparition come,</p>

<p>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc>  Sit down awhile,</p>

<p>And let us once again assail your ears,</p>

<p>That are so fortified against our story,</p>

<p>What we have two nights seen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Well, sit we down,</p>

<p>And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc>  Last night of all,</p>

<p>When yond same star that’s westward from the pole</p>

<p>Had made his course t’ illume that part of heaven</p>

<p>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</p>

<p>The bell then beating one–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ghost.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>Peace, break thee off! Look where it comes again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc></p>

<p>In the same figure like the King that’s dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc> <i>[to Horatio]</i></p>

<p>Thou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc></p>

<p>Looks he not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc></p>

<p>It would be spoke to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  Speak to it, Horatio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,</p>

<p>Together with that fair and warlike form</p>

<p>In which the majesty of buried Denmark</p>

<p>Did sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee,</p>

<p>speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>It is offended.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc>  See, it stalks away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Stay! speak! speak! I charge thee, speak!</p>

<p><center><i>[Ghost exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  ’Tis gone and will not answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc></p>

<p>How now, Horatio, you tremble and look pale.</p>

<p>Is not this something more than fantasy?</p>

<p>What think you on ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Before my God, I might not this believe</p>

<p>Without the sensible and true avouch</p>

<p>Of mine own eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  Is it not like the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  As thou art to thyself.</p>

<p>Such was the very armor he had on</p>

<p>When he the ambitious Norway combated.</p>

<p>So frowned he once when, in an angry parle,</p>

<p>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</p>

<p>’Tis strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</p>

<p>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>In what particular thought to work I know not,</p>

<p>But in the gross and scope of mine opinion</p>

<p>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</p>

<p>Why this same strict and most observant watch</p>

<p>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</p>

<p>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon</p>

<p>And foreign mart for implements of war,</p>

<p>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</p>

<p>Does not divide the Sunday from the week.</p>

<p>What might be toward that this sweaty haste</p>

<p>Doth make the night joint laborer with the day?</p>

<p>Who is ’t that can inform me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  That can I.</p>

<p>At least the whisper goes so: our last king,</p>

<p>Whose image even but now appeared to us,</p>

<p>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</p>

<p>Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,</p>

<p>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet</p>

<p>(For so this side of our known world esteemed him)</p>

<p>Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact,</p>

<p>Well ratified by law and heraldry,</p>

<p>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</p>

<p>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror.</p>

<p>Against the which a moiety competent</p>

<p>Was gaged by our king, which had returned</p>

<p>To the inheritance of Fortinbras</p>

<p>Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart</p>

<p>And carriage of the article designed,</p>

<p>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</p>

<p>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</p>

<p>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</p>

<p>Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes</p>

<p>For food and diet to some enterprise</p>

<p>That hath a stomach in ’t; which is no other</p>

<p>(As it doth well appear unto our state)</p>

<p>But to recover of us, by strong hand</p>

<p>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</p>

<p>So by his father lost. And this, I take it,</p>

<p>Is the main motive of our preparations,</p>

<p>The source of this our watch, and the chief head</p>

<p>Of this posthaste and rummage in the land.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc></p>

<p>I think it be no other but e’en so.</p>

<p>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</p>

<p>Comes armed through our watch so like the king</p>

<p>That was and is the question of these wars.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.</p>

<p>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</p>

<p>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</p>

<p>The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead</p>

<p>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;</p>

<p>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</p>

<p>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,</p>

<p>Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands,</p>

<p>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.</p>

<p>And even the like precurse of feared events,</p>

<p>As harbingers preceding still the fates</p>

<p>And prologue to the omen coming on,</p>

<p>Have heaven and Earth together demonstrated</p>

<p>Unto our climatures and countrymen.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ghost.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!</p>

<p>I’ll cross it though it blast me.–Stay, illusion!</p>

<p><center><i>[It spreads his arms.]</i></center></p>

<p>If thou hast any sound or use of voice,</p>

<p>Speak to me.</p>

<p>If there be any good thing to be done</p>

<p>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,</p>

<p>Speak to me.</p>

<p>If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,</p>

<p>Which happily foreknowing may avoid,</p>

<p>O, speak!</p>

<p>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</p>

<p>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</p>

<p>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,</p>

<p>Speak of it.     <i><i>[The cock crows.]</i></i></p>

<p>Stay and speak!–Stop it, Marcellus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>Shall I strike it with my partisan?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Do, if it will not stand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc>  ’Tis here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  ’Tis here.</p>

<p><center><i>[Ghost exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  ’Tis gone.</p>

<p>We do it wrong, being so majestical,</p>

<p>To offer it the show of violence,</p>

<p>For it is as the air, invulnerable,</p>

<p>And our vain blows malicious mockery.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc></p>

<p>It was about to speak when the cock crew.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>And then it started like a guilty thing</p>

<p>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard</p>

<p>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</p>

<p>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</p>

<p>Awake the god of day, and at his warning,</p>

<p>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</p>

<p>Th’ extravagant and erring spirit hies</p>

<p>To his confine, and of the truth herein</p>

<p>This present object made probation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</p>

<p>Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes</p>

<p>Wherein our Savior’s birth is celebrated,</p>

<p>This bird of dawning singeth all night long;</p>

<p>And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,</p>

<p>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,</p>

<p>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</p>

<p>So hallowed and so gracious is that time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</p>

<p>But look, the morn in russet mantle clad</p>

<p>Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.</p>

<p>Break we our watch up, and by my advice</p>

<p>Let us impart what we have seen tonight</p>

<p>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,</p>

<p>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</p>

<p>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it</p>

<p>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>Let’s do ’t, I pray, and I this morning know</p>

<p>Where we shall find him most convenient.</p>
