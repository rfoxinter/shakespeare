<p><center><i>[Enter old Polonius with his man Reynaldo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span></p>

<p>Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span>  I will, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span></p>

<p>You shall do marvelous wisely, good Reynaldo,</p>

<p>Before you visit him, to make inquire</p>

<p>Of his behavior.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span>  My lord, I did intend it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span></p>

<p>Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,</p>

<p>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</p>

<p>And how, and who, what means, and where they</p>

<p>keep,</p>

<p>What company, at what expense; and finding</p>

<p>By this encompassment and drift of question</p>

<p>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</p>

<p>Than your particular demands will touch it.</p>

<p>Take you, as ’twere, some distant knowledge of him,</p>

<p>As thus: “I know his father and his friends</p>

<p>And, in part, him.” Do you mark this, Reynaldo?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span>  Ay, very well, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span></p>

<p>“And, in part, him, but,” you may say, “not well.</p>

<p>But if ’t be he I mean, he’s very wild,</p>

<p>Addicted so and so.” And there put on him</p>

<p>What forgeries you please–marry, none so rank</p>

<p>As may dishonor him, take heed of that,</p>

<p>But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips</p>

<p>As are companions noted and most known</p>

<p>To youth and liberty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span>  As gaming, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span>  Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing,</p>

<p>Quarreling, drabbing–you may go so far.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span>  My lord, that would dishonor him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span></p>

<p>Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.</p>

<p>You must not put another scandal on him</p>

<p>That he is open to incontinency;</p>

<p>That’s not my meaning. But breathe his faults so</p>

<p>quaintly</p>

<p>That they may seem the taints of liberty,</p>

<p>The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</p>

<p>A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</p>

<p>Of general assault.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span>  But, my good lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span>  Wherefore should you do this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span>  Ay, my lord, I would know that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span>  Marry, sir, here’s my drift,</p>

<p>And I believe it is a fetch of wit.</p>

<p>You, laying these slight sullies on my son,</p>

<p>As ’twere a thing a little soiled i’ th’ working,</p>

<p>Mark you, your party in converse, him you would</p>

<p>sound,</p>

<p>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</p>

<p>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</p>

<p>He closes with you in this consequence:</p>

<p>“Good sir,” or so, or “friend,” or “gentleman,”</p>

<p>According to the phrase or the addition</p>

<p>Of man and country–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span>  Very good, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span>  And then, sir, does he this, he does–what</p>

<p>was I about to say? By the Mass, I was about to say</p>

<p>something. Where did I leave?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span>  At “closes in the consequence,” at “friend,</p>

<p>or so,” and “gentleman.”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span></p>

<p>At “closes in the consequence”–ay, marry–</p>

<p>He closes thus: “I know the gentleman.</p>

<p>I saw him yesterday,” or “th’ other day”</p>

<p>(Or then, or then, with such or such), “and as you</p>

<p>say,</p>

<p>There was he gaming, there o’ertook in ’s rouse,</p>

<p>There falling out at tennis”; or perchance</p>

<p>“I saw him enter such a house of sale”–</p>

<p>Videlicet, a brothel–or so forth. See you now</p>

<p>Your bait of falsehood take this carp of truth;</p>

<p>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</p>

<p>With windlasses and with assays of bias,</p>

<p>By indirections find directions out.</p>

<p>So by my former lecture and advice</p>

<p>Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span></p>

<p>My lord, I have.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span>  God be wi’ you. Fare you well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span>  Good my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span></p>

<p>Observe his inclination in yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span>  I shall, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span>  And let him ply his music.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Reynaldo</span>  Well, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span></p>

<p>Farewell.     <i><i>[Reynaldo exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ophelia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Ophelia, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ophelia</span></p>

<p>O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span>  With what, i’ th’ name of God?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ophelia</span></p>

<p>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</p>

<p>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced,</p>

<p>No hat upon his head, his stockings fouled,</p>

<p>Ungartered, and down-gyved to his ankle,</p>

<p>Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,</p>

<p>And with a look so piteous in purport</p>

<p>As if he had been loosed out of hell</p>

<p>To speak of horrors–he comes before me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span></p>

<p>Mad for thy love?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ophelia</span>  My lord, I do not know,</p>

<p>But truly I do fear it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span>  What said he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ophelia</span></p>

<p>He took me by the wrist and held me hard.</p>

<p>Then goes he to the length of all his arm,</p>

<p>And, with his other hand thus o’er his brow,</p>

<p>He falls to such perusal of my face</p>

<p>As he would draw it. Long stayed he so.</p>

<p>At last, a little shaking of mine arm,</p>

<p>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</p>

<p>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</p>

<p>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</p>

<p>And end his being. That done, he lets me go,</p>

<p>And, with his head over his shoulder turned,</p>

<p>He seemed to find his way without his eyes,</p>

<p>For out o’ doors he went without their helps</p>

<p>And to the last bended their light on me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span></p>

<p>Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.</p>

<p>This is the very ecstasy of love,</p>

<p>Whose violent property fordoes itself</p>

<p>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</p>

<p>As oft as any passions under heaven</p>

<p>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</p>

<p>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ophelia</span></p>

<p>No, my good lord, but as you did command</p>

<p>I did repel his letters and denied</p>

<p>His access to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Polonius</span>  That hath made him mad.</p>

<p>I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</p>

<p>I had not coted him. I feared he did but trifle</p>

<p>And meant to wrack thee. But beshrew my jealousy!</p>

<p>By heaven, it is as proper to our age</p>

<p>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions</p>

<p>As it is common for the younger sort</p>

<p>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.</p>

<p>This must be known, which, being kept close, might</p>

<p>move</p>

<p>More grief to hide than hate to utter love.</p>

<p>Come.</p>
