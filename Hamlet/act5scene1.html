<p><center><i>[Enter Gravedigger and Another.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Is she to be buried in Christian burial,</p>

<p>when she willfully seeks her own salvation?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Other</sc>  I tell thee she is. Therefore make her grave</p>

<p>straight. The crowner hath sat on her and finds it</p>

<p>Christian burial.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  How can that be, unless she drowned</p>

<p>herself in her own defense?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Other</sc>  Why, ’tis found so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  It must be se offendendo; it cannot be</p>

<p>else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself</p>

<p>wittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath three</p>

<p>branches–it is to act, to do, to perform. Argal, she</p>

<p>drowned herself wittingly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Other</sc>  Nay, but hear you, goodman delver–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Give me leave. Here lies the water;</p>

<p>good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to</p>

<p>this water and drown himself, it is (will he, nill he)</p>

<p>he goes; mark you that. But if the water come to him</p>

<p>and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he</p>

<p>that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his</p>

<p>own life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Other</sc>  But is this law?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Ay, marry, is ’t–crowner’s ’quest law.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Other</sc>  Will you ha’ the truth on ’t? If this had not been</p>

<p>a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’</p>

<p>Christian burial.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Why, there thou sayst. And the more</p>

<p>pity that great folk should have count’nance in this</p>

<p>world to drown or hang themselves more than</p>

<p>their even-Christian. Come, my spade. There is no</p>

<p>ancient gentlemen but gard’ners, ditchers, and</p>

<p>grave-makers. They hold up Adam’s profession.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Other</sc>  Was he a gentleman?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  He was the first that ever bore arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Other</sc>  Why, he had none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  What, art a heathen? How dost thou</p>

<p>understand the scripture? The scripture says Adam</p>

<p>digged. Could he dig without arms? I’ll put another</p>

<p>question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the</p>

<p>purpose, confess thyself–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Other</sc>  Go to!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  What is he that builds stronger than</p>

<p>either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Other</sc>  The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a</p>

<p>thousand tenants.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  I like thy wit well, in good faith. The</p>

<p>gallows does well. But how does it well? It does</p>

<p>well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say the</p>

<p>gallows is built stronger than the church. Argal, the</p>

<p>gallows may do well to thee. To ’t again, come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Other</sc>  “Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright,</p>

<p>or a carpenter?”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Other</sc>  Marry, now I can tell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  To ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Other</sc>  Mass, I cannot tell.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Cudgel thy brains no more about it,</p>

<p>for your dull ass will not mend his pace with</p>

<p>beating. And, when you are asked this question</p>

<p>next, say “a grave-maker.” The houses he makes</p>

<p>lasts till doomsday. Go, get thee in, and fetch me a</p>

<p>stoup of liquor.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Other Man exits</p>

<p>and the Gravedigger digs and sings.]</i></center></p>

<p>     <i>In youth when I did love, did love,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Methought it was very sweet</i></p>

<p>     <i>To contract–O–the time for–a–my behove,</i></p>

<p>        <i>O, methought there–a–was nothing–a–meet.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Has this fellow no feeling of his business? He</p>

<p>sings in grave-making.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Custom hath made it in him a property of</p>

<p>easiness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  ’Tis e’en so. The hand of little employment</p>

<p>hath the daintier sense.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>But age with his stealing steps</i></p>

<p>     <i>Hath clawed me in his clutch,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And hath shipped me into the land,</i></p>

<p>     <i>As if I had never been such.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[He digs up a skull.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  That skull had a tongue in it and could sing</p>

<p>once. How the knave jowls it to the ground as if</p>

<p>’twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder!</p>

<p>This might be the pate of a politician which this ass</p>

<p>now o’erreaches, one that would circumvent God,</p>

<p>might it not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  It might, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Or of a courtier, which could say “Good</p>

<p>morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, sweet lord?”</p>

<p>This might be my Lord Such-a-one that praised my</p>

<p>Lord Such-a-one’s horse when he went to beg it,</p>

<p>might it not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Ay, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Why, e’en so. And now my Lady Worm’s,</p>

<p>chapless and knocked about the mazard with a</p>

<p>sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we had</p>

<p>the trick to see ’t. Did these bones cost no more the</p>

<p>breeding but to play at loggets with them? Mine</p>

<p>ache to think on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc> <i>[sings]</i></p>

<p>     <i>A pickax and a spade, a spade,</i></p>

<p>     <i>For and a shrouding sheet,</i></p>

<p>     <i>O, a pit of clay for to be made</i></p>

<p>     <i>For such a guest is meet.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[He digs up more skulls.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  There’s another. Why may not that be the</p>

<p>skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his</p>

<p>quillities, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why</p>

<p>does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him</p>

<p>about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell</p>

<p>him of his action of battery? Hum, this fellow might</p>

<p>be in ’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,</p>

<p>his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,</p>

<p>his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines and the</p>

<p>recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full</p>

<p>of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more</p>

<p>of his purchases, and double ones too, than the</p>

<p>length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very</p>

<p>conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box,</p>

<p>and must th’ inheritor himself have no more, ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Not a jot more, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Is not parchment made of sheepskins?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Ay, my lord, and of calves’ skins too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  They are sheep and calves which seek out</p>

<p>assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow.–</p>

<p>Whose grave’s this, sirrah?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Mine, sir.</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>O, a pit of clay for to be made</i></p>

<p>     <i>For such a guest is meet.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  You lie out on ’t, sir, and therefore ’tis</p>

<p>not yours. For my part, I do not lie in ’t, yet it is</p>

<p>mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Thou dost lie in ’t, to be in ’t and say it is thine.</p>

<p>’Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou</p>

<p>liest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  ’Tis a quick lie, sir; ’twill away again</p>

<p>from me to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  What man dost thou dig it for?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  For no man, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  What woman then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  For none, neither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Who is to be buried in ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  One that was a woman, sir, but, rest</p>

<p>her soul, she’s dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  How absolute the knave is! We must speak by</p>

<p>the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the</p>

<p>Lord, Horatio, this three years I have took note of</p>

<p>it: the age is grown so picked that the toe of the</p>

<p>peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he</p>

<p>galls his kibe.–How long hast thou been</p>

<p>grave-maker?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Of all the days i’ th’ year, I came to ’t</p>

<p>that day that our last King Hamlet overcame</p>

<p>Fortinbras.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  How long is that since?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Cannot you tell that? Every fool can</p>

<p>tell that. It was that very day that young Hamlet</p>

<p>was born–he that is mad, and sent into England.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Why, because he was mad. He shall</p>

<p>recover his wits there. Or if he do not, ’tis no great</p>

<p>matter there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Why?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  ’Twill not be seen in him there. There</p>

<p>the men are as mad as he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  How came he mad?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Very strangely, they say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  How “strangely”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Faith, e’en with losing his wits.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Upon what ground?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Why, here in Denmark. I have been</p>

<p>sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  How long will a man lie i’ th’ earth ere he rot?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Faith, if he be not rotten before he die</p>

<p>(as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will</p>

<p>scarce hold the laying in), he will last you some</p>

<p>eight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine</p>

<p>year.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Why he more than another?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his</p>

<p>trade that he will keep out water a great while; and</p>

<p>your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead</p>

<p>body. Here’s a skull now hath lien you i’ th’ earth</p>

<p>three-and-twenty years.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Whose was it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  A whoreson mad fellow’s it was.</p>

<p>Whose do you think it was?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Nay, I know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!</p>

<p>He poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.</p>

<p>This same skull, sir, was, sir, Yorick’s skull, the</p>

<p>King’s jester.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  This?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gravedigger</sc>  E’en that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc> <i>[taking the skull]</i>  Let me see. Alas, poor</p>

<p>Yorick! I knew him, Horatio–a fellow of infinite</p>

<p>jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath bore me on his</p>

<p>back a thousand times, and now how abhorred in</p>

<p>my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung</p>

<p>those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.</p>

<p>Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your</p>

<p>songs? your flashes of merriment that were wont to</p>

<p>set the table on a roar? Not one now to mock your</p>

<p>own grinning? Quite chapfallen? Now get you to my</p>

<p>lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch</p>

<p>thick, to this favor she must come. Make her laugh</p>

<p>at that.–Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  What’s that, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this</p>

<p>fashion i’ th’ earth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  E’en so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  And smelt so? Pah!     <i><i>[He puts the skull down.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  E’en so, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  To what base uses we may return, Horatio!</p>

<p>Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of</p>

<p>Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  ’Twere to consider too curiously to consider</p>

<p>so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither,</p>

<p>with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it, as</p>

<p>thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander</p>

<p>returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth</p>

<p>we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he</p>

<p>was converted might they not stop a beer barrel?</p>

<p>Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,</p>

<p>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.</p>

<p>O, that that earth which kept the world in awe</p>

<p>Should patch a wall t’ expel the winter’s flaw!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords attendant, and the</p>

<p>corpse of Ophelia, with a Doctor of Divinity.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But soft, but soft awhile! Here comes the King,</p>

<p>The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?</p>

<p>And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken</p>

<p>The corse they follow did with desp’rate hand</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  What ceremony else?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  What ceremony else?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>Her obsequies have been as far enlarged</p>

<p>As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful,</p>

<p>And, but that great command o’ersways the order,</p>

<p>She should in ground unsanctified been lodged</p>

<p>Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers</p>

<p>Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on</p>

<p>her.</p>

<p>Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants,</p>

<p>Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home</p>

<p>Of bell and burial.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>Must there no more be done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  No more be done.</p>

<p>We should profane the service of the dead</p>

<p>To sing a requiem and such rest to her</p>

<p>As to peace-parted souls.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  Lay her i’ th’ earth,</p>

<p>And from her fair and unpolluted flesh</p>

<p>May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,</p>

<p>A minist’ring angel shall my sister be</p>

<p>Until my eyelids will no longer wag!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  O my son, what theme?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>I loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers</p>

<p>Could not with all their quantity of love</p>

<p>Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  O, he is mad, Laertes!</p>

<p>Woo’t weep, woo’t fight, woo’t fast, woo’t tear</p>

<p>thyself,</p>

<p>I’ll do ’t. Dost thou come here to whine?</p>

<p>To outface me with leaping in her grave?</p>

<p>Be buried quick with her, and so will I.</p>

<p>And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw</p>

<p>Millions of acres on us, till our ground,</p>

<p>Singeing his pate against the burning zone,</p>

<p>Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou ’lt mouth,</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  This is mere madness;</p>

<p>And thus awhile the fit will work on him.</p>

<p>Anon, as patient as the female dove</p>

<p>When that her golden couplets are disclosed,</p>

<p>His silence will sit drooping.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Hear you, sir,</p>

<p>What is the reason that you use me thus?</p>

<p>I loved you ever. But it is no matter.</p>

<p>Let Hercules himself do what he may,</p>
