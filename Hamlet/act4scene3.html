<p><center><i>[Enter King and two or three.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>I have sent to seek him and to find the body.</p>

<p>How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!</p>

<p>Yet must not we put the strong law on him.</p>

<p>He’s loved of the distracted multitude,</p>

<p>Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;</p>

<p>And, where ’tis so, th’ offender’s scourge is weighed,</p>

<p>But never the offense. To bear all smooth and even,</p>

<p>This sudden sending him away must seem</p>

<p>Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown</p>

<p>By desperate appliance are relieved</p>

<p>Or not at all.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Rosencrantz.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, what hath befallen?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosencrantz</span></p>

<p>Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord,</p>

<p>We cannot get from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  But where is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosencrantz</span></p>

<p>Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Bring him before us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Rosencrantz</span>  Ho! Bring in the lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[They enter with Hamlet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  At supper.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  At supper where?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A</p>

<p>certain convocation of politic worms are e’en at</p>

<p>him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We</p>

<p>fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves</p>

<p>for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is</p>

<p>but variable service–two dishes but to one table.</p>

<p>That’s the end.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Alas, alas!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  A man may fish with the worm that hath eat</p>

<p>of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that</p>

<p>worm.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  What dost thou mean by this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Nothing but to show you how a king may go a</p>

<p>progress through the guts of a beggar.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Where is Polonius?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger</p>

<p>find him not there, seek him i’ th’ other</p>

<p>place yourself. But if, indeed, you find him not</p>

<p>within this month, you shall nose him as you go up</p>

<p>the stairs into the lobby.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[to Attendants.]</i>  Go, seek him there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  He will stay till you come.     <i><i>[Attendants exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety</p>

<p>(Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve</p>

<p>For that which thou hast done) must send thee</p>

<p>hence</p>

<p>With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.</p>

<p>The bark is ready, and the wind at help,</p>

<p>Th’ associates tend, and everything is bent</p>

<p>For England.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  For England?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Ay, Hamlet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>So is it, if thou knew’st our purposes.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for</p>

<p>England.</p>

<p>Farewell, dear mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Thy loving father, Hamlet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>My mother. Father and mother is man and wife,</p>

<p>Man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother.–</p>

<p>Come, for England.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.</p>

<p>Delay it not. I’ll have him hence tonight.</p>

<p>Away, for everything is sealed and done</p>

<p>That else leans on th’ affair. Pray you, make haste.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but the King exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>And England, if my love thou hold’st at aught</p>

<p>(As my great power thereof may give thee sense,</p>

<p>Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red</p>

<p>After the Danish sword, and thy free awe</p>

<p>Pays homage to us), thou mayst not coldly set</p>

<p>Our sovereign process, which imports at full,</p>

<p>By letters congruing to that effect,</p>

<p>The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England,</p>

<p>For like the hectic in my blood he rages,</p>

<p>And thou must cure me. Till I know ’tis done,</p>

<p>Howe’er my haps, my joys will ne’er begin.</p>
