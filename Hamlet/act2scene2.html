<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and</p>

<p>Guildenstern and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.</p>

<p>Moreover that we much did long to see you,</p>

<p>The need we have to use you did provoke</p>

<p>Our hasty sending. Something have you heard</p>

<p>Of Hamlet’s transformation, so call it,</p>

<p>Sith nor th’ exterior nor the inward man</p>

<p>Resembles that it was. What it should be,</p>

<p>More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him</p>

<p>So much from th’ understanding of himself</p>

<p>I cannot dream of. I entreat you both</p>

<p>That, being of so young days brought up with him</p>

<p>And sith so neighbored to his youth and havior,</p>

<p>That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court</p>

<p>Some little time, so by your companies</p>

<p>To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather</p>

<p>So much as from occasion you may glean,</p>

<p>Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus</p>

<p>That, opened, lies within our remedy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Good gentlemen, he hath much talked of you,</p>

<p>And sure I am two men there is not living</p>

<p>To whom he more adheres. If it will please you</p>

<p>To show us so much gentry and goodwill</p>

<p>As to expend your time with us awhile</p>

<p>For the supply and profit of our hope,</p>

<p>Your visitation shall receive such thanks</p>

<p>As fits a king’s remembrance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Both your Majesties</p>

<p>Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,</p>

<p>Put your dread pleasures more into command</p>

<p>Than to entreaty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  But we both obey,</p>

<p>And here give up ourselves in the full bent</p>

<p>To lay our service freely at your feet,</p>

<p>To be commanded.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.</p>

<p>And I beseech you instantly to visit</p>

<p>My too much changed son.–Go, some of you,</p>

<p>And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc></p>

<p>Heavens make our presence and our practices</p>

<p>Pleasant and helpful to him!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Ay, amen!</p>

<p><center><i>[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit</p>

<p>with some Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Polonius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Th’ ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,</p>

<p>Are joyfully returned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Thou still hast been the father of good news.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege</p>

<p>I hold my duty as I hold my soul,</p>

<p>Both to my God and to my gracious king,</p>

<p>And I do think, or else this brain of mine</p>

<p>Hunts not the trail of policy so sure</p>

<p>As it hath used to do, that I have found</p>

<p>The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Give first admittance to th’ ambassadors.</p>

<p>My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Thyself do grace to them and bring them in.</p>

<p><center><i>[Polonius exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found</p>

<p>The head and source of all your son’s distemper.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>I doubt it is no other but the main–</p>

<p>His father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Well, we shall sift him.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ambassadors Voltemand and Cornelius with</p>

<p>Polonius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Welcome, my good friends.</p>

<p>Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Voltemand</sc></p>

<p>Most fair return of greetings and desires.</p>

<p>Upon our first, he sent out to suppress</p>

<p>His nephew’s levies, which to him appeared</p>

<p>To be a preparation ’gainst the Polack,</p>

<p>But, better looked into, he truly found</p>

<p>It was against your Highness. Whereat, grieved</p>

<p>That so his sickness, age, and impotence</p>

<p>Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests</p>

<p>On Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys,</p>

<p>Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,</p>

<p>Makes vow before his uncle never more</p>

<p>To give th’ assay of arms against your Majesty.</p>

<p>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</p>

<p>Gives him three-score thousand crowns in annual</p>

<p>fee</p>

<p>And his commission to employ those soldiers,</p>

<p>So levied as before, against the Polack,</p>

<p>With an entreaty, herein further shown,</p>

<p><center><i>[He gives a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>That it might please you to give quiet pass</p>

<p>Through your dominions for this enterprise,</p>

<p>On such regards of safety and allowance</p>

<p>As therein are set down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  It likes us well,</p>

<p>And, at our more considered time, we’ll read,</p>

<p>Answer, and think upon this business.</p>

<p>Meantime, we thank you for your well-took labor.</p>

<p>Go to your rest. At night we’ll feast together.</p>

<p>Most welcome home!</p>

<p><center><i>[Voltemand and Cornelius exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  This business is well ended.</p>

<p>My liege, and madam, to expostulate</p>

<p>What majesty should be, what duty is,</p>

<p>Why day is day, night night, and time is time</p>

<p>Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.</p>

<p>Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,</p>

<p>And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,</p>

<p>I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.</p>

<p>“Mad” call I it, for, to define true madness,</p>

<p>What is ’t but to be nothing else but mad?</p>

<p>But let that go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  More matter with less art.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Madam, I swear I use no art at all.</p>

<p>That he’s mad, ’tis true; ’tis true ’tis pity,</p>

<p>And pity ’tis ’tis true–a foolish figure,</p>

<p>But farewell it, for I will use no art.</p>

<p>Mad let us grant him then, and now remains</p>

<p>That we find out the cause of this effect,</p>

<p>Or, rather say, the cause of this defect,</p>

<p>For this effect defective comes by cause.</p>

<p>Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.</p>

<p>Perpend.</p>

<p>I have a daughter (have while she is mine)</p>

<p>Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,</p>

<p>Hath given me this. Now gather and surmise.</p>

<p><i>[He reads.]</i> To the celestial, and my soul’s idol, the</p>

<p>most beautified Ophelia–</p>

<p>That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; “beautified” is a</p>

<p>vile phrase. But you shall hear. Thus: <i>[He reads.]</i></p>

<p>In her excellent white bosom, these, etc.–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Came this from Hamlet to her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.</p>

<p><center><i>[He reads the letter.]</i></center></p>

<p>     <i>Doubt thou the stars are fire,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Doubt that the sun doth move,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Doubt truth to be a liar,</i></p>

<p>        <i>But never doubt I love.</i></p>

<p>O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not</p>

<p>art to reckon my groans, but that I love thee best, O</p>

<p>most best, believe it. Adieu.</p>

<p>Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst</p>

<p>this machine is to him, Hamlet.</p>

<p>This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,</p>

<p>And more above, hath his solicitings,</p>

<p>As they fell out by time, by means, and place,</p>

<p>All given to mine ear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  But how hath she received his love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  What do you think of me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>As of a man faithful and honorable.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>I would fain prove so. But what might you think,</p>

<p>When I had seen this hot love on the wing</p>

<p>(As I perceived it, I must tell you that,</p>

<p>Before my daughter told me), what might you,</p>

<p>Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,</p>

<p>If I had played the desk or table-book</p>

<p>Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,</p>

<p>Or looked upon this love with idle sight?</p>

<p>What might you think? No, I went round to work,</p>

<p>And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:</p>

<p>“Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.</p>

<p>This must not be.” And then I prescripts gave her,</p>

<p>That she should lock herself from his resort,</p>

<p>Admit no messengers, receive no tokens;</p>

<p>Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,</p>

<p>And he, repelled (a short tale to make),</p>

<p>Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,</p>

<p>Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,</p>

<p>Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,</p>

<p>Into the madness wherein now he raves</p>

<p>And all we mourn for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc> <i>[to Queen]</i>  Do you think ’tis this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  It may be, very like.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Hath there been such a time (I would fain know</p>

<p>that)</p>

<p>That I have positively said “’Tis so,”</p>

<p>When it proved otherwise?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Not that I know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Take this from this, if this be otherwise.</p>

<p>If circumstances lead me, I will find</p>

<p>Where truth is hid, though it were hid, indeed,</p>

<p>Within the center.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  How may we try it further?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>You know sometimes he walks four hours together</p>

<p>Here in the lobby.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  So he does indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him.</p>

<p><i>[To the King.]</i> Be you and I behind an arras then.</p>

<p>Mark the encounter. If he love her not,</p>

<p>And be not from his reason fall’n thereon,</p>

<p>Let me be no assistant for a state,</p>

<p>But keep a farm and carters.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  We will try it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hamlet reading on a book.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>But look where sadly the poor wretch comes</p>

<p>reading.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Away, I do beseech you both, away.</p>

<p>I’ll board him presently. O, give me leave.</p>

<p><center><i>[King and Queen exit with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<p>How does my good Lord Hamlet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Well, God-a-mercy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  Do you know me, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  Not I, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Then I would you were so honest a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  Honest, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to</p>

<p>be one man picked out of ten thousand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  That’s very true, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  For if the sun breed maggots in a dead</p>

<p>dog, being a good kissing carrion–Have you a</p>

<p>daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  I have, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Let her not walk i’ th’ sun. Conception is a</p>

<p>blessing, but, as your daughter may conceive,</p>

<p>friend, look to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  How say you by that? Still harping on</p>

<p>my daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said I</p>

<p>was a fishmonger. He is far gone. And truly, in my</p>

<p>youth, I suffered much extremity for love, very near</p>

<p>this. I’ll speak to him again.–What do you read, my</p>

<p>lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Words, words, words.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  What is the matter, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Between who?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  I mean the matter that you read, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here</p>

<p>that old men have gray beards, that their faces are</p>

<p>wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and</p>

<p>plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of</p>

<p>wit, together with most weak hams; all which, sir,</p>

<p>though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I</p>

<p>hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for</p>

<p>yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if, like a crab,</p>

<p>you could go backward.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Though this be madness, yet there is</p>

<p>method in ’t.–Will you walk out of the air, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Into my grave?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  Indeed, that’s out of the air. <i>[Aside.]</i> How</p>

<p>pregnant sometimes his replies are! A happiness</p>

<p>that often madness hits on, which reason and</p>

<p>sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I</p>

<p>will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of</p>

<p>meeting between him and my daughter.–My lord,</p>

<p>I will take my leave of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I</p>

<p>will more willingly part withal–except my life,</p>

<p>except my life, except my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  Fare you well, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  These tedious old fools.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Guildenstern and Rosencrantz.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc> <i>[to Polonius]</i>  God save you, sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[Polonius exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  My honored lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  My most dear lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  My excellent good friends! How dost thou,</p>

<p>Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do</p>

<p>you both?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc></p>

<p>As the indifferent children of the earth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc></p>

<p>Happy in that we are not overhappy.</p>

<p>On Fortune’s cap, we are not the very button.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Nor the soles of her shoe?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Neither, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Then you live about her waist, or in the</p>

<p>middle of her favors?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  Faith, her privates we.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true!</p>

<p>She is a strumpet. What news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  None, my lord, but that the world’s</p>

<p>grown honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Then is doomsday near. But your news is not</p>

<p>true. Let me question more in particular. What</p>

<p>have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of</p>

<p>Fortune that she sends you to prison hither?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  Prison, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Denmark’s a prison.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Then is the world one.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  A goodly one, in which there are many confines,</p>

<p>wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’</p>

<p>th’ worst.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  We think not so, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Why, then, ’tis none to you, for there is</p>

<p>nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it</p>

<p>so. To me, it is a prison.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Why, then, your ambition makes it one.</p>

<p>’Tis too narrow for your mind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and</p>

<p>count myself a king of infinite space, were it not</p>

<p>that I have bad dreams.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  Which dreams, indeed, are ambition,</p>

<p>for the very substance of the ambitious is merely</p>

<p>the shadow of a dream.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  A dream itself is but a shadow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy</p>

<p>and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs</p>

<p>and outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows.</p>

<p>Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I cannot</p>

<p>reason.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>/<sc>Guildenstern</sc>  We’ll wait upon you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  No such matter. I will not sort you with the</p>

<p>rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an</p>

<p>honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But,</p>

<p>in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at</p>

<p>Elsinore?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks;</p>

<p>but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks</p>

<p>are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for?</p>

<p>Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation?</p>

<p>Come, come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay,</p>

<p>speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  What should we say, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Anything but to th’ purpose. You were sent</p>

<p>for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks</p>

<p>which your modesties have not craft enough to</p>

<p>color. I know the good king and queen have sent for</p>

<p>you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  To what end, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  That you must teach me. But let me conjure</p>

<p>you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy</p>

<p>of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved</p>

<p>love, and by what more dear a better</p>

<p>proposer can charge you withal: be even and direct</p>

<p>with me whether you were sent for or no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc> <i>[to Guildenstern]</i>  What say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.–If</p>

<p>you love me, hold not off.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  My lord, we were sent for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation</p>

<p>prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the</p>

<p>King and Queen molt no feather. I have of late, but</p>

<p>wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all</p>

<p>custom of exercises, and, indeed, it goes so heavily</p>

<p>with my disposition that this goodly frame, the</p>

<p>Earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most</p>

<p>excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging</p>

<p>firmament, this majestical roof, fretted</p>

<p>with golden fire–why, it appeareth nothing to me</p>

<p>but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.</p>

<p>What a piece of work is a man, how noble in</p>

<p>reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving</p>

<p>how express and admirable; in action how like</p>

<p>an angel, in apprehension how like a god: the</p>

<p>beauty of the world, the paragon of animals–and</p>

<p>yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man</p>

<p>delights not me, no, nor women neither, though by</p>

<p>your smiling you seem to say so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  My lord, there was no such stuff in my</p>

<p>thoughts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Why did you laugh, then, when I said “man</p>

<p>delights not me”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  To think, my lord, if you delight not in</p>

<p>man, what Lenten entertainment the players shall</p>

<p>receive from you. We coted them on the way, and</p>

<p>hither are they coming to offer you service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  He that plays the king shall be welcome–his</p>

<p>Majesty shall have tribute on me. The adventurous</p>

<p>knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall</p>

<p>not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his</p>

<p>part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh</p>

<p>whose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sear, and the lady</p>

<p>shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall</p>

<p>halt for ’t. What players are they?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Even those you were wont to take such</p>

<p>delight in, the tragedians of the city.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  How chances it they travel? Their residence,</p>

<p>both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  I think their inhibition comes by the</p>

<p>means of the late innovation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Do they hold the same estimation they did</p>

<p>when I was in the city? Are they so followed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  No, indeed are they not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  How comes it? Do they grow rusty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted</p>

<p>pace. But there is, sir, an aerie of children, little</p>

<p>eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are</p>

<p>most tyrannically clapped for ’t. These are now the</p>

<p>fashion and so berattle the common stages (so</p>

<p>they call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid</p>

<p>of goose quills and dare scarce come thither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  What, are they children? Who maintains ’em?</p>

<p>How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality</p>

<p>no longer than they can sing? Will they not say</p>

<p>afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common</p>

<p>players (as it is most like, if their means are</p>

<p>no better), their writers do them wrong to make</p>

<p>them exclaim against their own succession?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Faith, there has been much to-do on</p>

<p>both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar</p>

<p>them to controversy. There was for a while no</p>

<p>money bid for argument unless the poet and the</p>

<p>player went to cuffs in the question.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Is ’t possible?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  O, there has been much throwing</p>

<p>about of brains.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Do the boys carry it away?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Ay, that they do, my lord–Hercules</p>

<p>and his load too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of</p>

<p>Denmark, and those that would make mouths at</p>

<p>him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty,</p>

<p>a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.</p>

<p>’Sblood, there is something in this more than natural,</p>

<p>if philosophy could find it out.</p>

<p><center><i>[A flourish for the Players.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  There are the players.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.</p>

<p>Your hands, come then. Th’ appurtenance of welcome</p>

<p>is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply</p>

<p>with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players,</p>

<p>which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should</p>

<p>more appear like entertainment than yours. You are</p>

<p>welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are</p>

<p>deceived.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Guildenstern</sc>  In what, my dear lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I am but mad north-north-west. When the</p>

<p>wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Polonius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  Well be with you, gentlemen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too–at</p>

<p>each ear a hearer! That great baby you see there is</p>

<p>not yet out of his swaddling clouts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Haply he is the second time come to</p>

<p>them, for they say an old man is twice a child.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the</p>

<p>players; mark it.–You say right, sir, a Monday</p>

<p>morning, ’twas then indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  My lord, I have news to tell you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  My lord, I have news to tell you: when Roscius</p>

<p>was an actor in Rome–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  The actors are come hither, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Buzz, buzz.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  Upon my honor–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Then came each actor on his ass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  The best actors in the world, either for</p>

<p>tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,</p>

<p>historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,</p>

<p>tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or</p>

<p>poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor</p>

<p>Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty,</p>

<p>these are the only men.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure</p>

<p>hadst thou!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  What a treasure had he, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Why,</p>

<p>     <i>One fair daughter, and no more,</i></p>

<p>     <i>The which he loved passing well.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Still on my daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Am I not i’ th’ right, old Jephthah?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  If you call me “Jephthah,” my lord: I have a</p>

<p>daughter that I love passing well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Nay, that follows not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  What follows then, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Why,</p>

<p>     <i>As by lot, God wot</i></p>

<p>and then, you know,</p>

<p>     <i>It came to pass, as most like it was–</i></p>

<p>the first row of the pious chanson will show you</p>

<p>more, for look where my abridgment comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Players.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>You are welcome, masters; welcome all.–I am glad</p>

<p>to see thee well.–Welcome, good friends.–O my</p>

<p>old friend! Why, thy face is valanced since I saw thee</p>

<p>last. Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark?–What,</p>

<p>my young lady and mistress! By ’r Lady, your Ladyship</p>

<p>is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by</p>

<p>the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a</p>

<p>piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the</p>

<p>ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to ’t</p>

<p>like French falconers, fly at anything we see. We’ll</p>

<p>have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your</p>

<p>quality. Come, a passionate speech.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Player</sc>  What speech, my good lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it</p>

<p>was never acted, or, if it was, not above once; for</p>

<p>the play, I remember, pleased not the million:</p>

<p>’twas caviary to the general. But it was (as I</p>

<p>received it, and others whose judgments in such</p>

<p>matters cried in the top of mine) an excellent play,</p>

<p>well digested in the scenes, set down with as much</p>

<p>modesty as cunning. I remember one said there</p>

<p>were no sallets in the lines to make the matter</p>

<p>savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict</p>

<p>the author of affection, but called it an honest</p>

<p>method, as wholesome as sweet and, by very much,</p>

<p>more handsome than fine. One speech in ’t I</p>

<p>chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and</p>

<p>thereabout of it especially when he speaks of</p>

<p>Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at</p>

<p>this line–let me see, let me see:</p>

<p>The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast–</p>

<p>’tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:</p>

<p>The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</p>

<p>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</p>

<p>When he lay couched in th’ ominous horse,</p>

<p>Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared</p>

<p>With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot,</p>

<p>Now is he total gules, horridly tricked</p>

<p>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</p>

<p>Baked and impasted with the parching streets,</p>

<p>That lend a tyrannous and a damned light</p>

<p>To their lord’s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,</p>

<p>And thus o’ersized with coagulate gore,</p>

<p>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</p>

<p>Old grandsire Priam seeks.</p>

<p>So, proceed you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  ’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good</p>

<p>accent and good discretion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Player</sc>  Anon he finds him</p>

<p>Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,</p>

<p>Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</p>

<p>Repugnant to command. Unequal matched,</p>

<p>Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;</p>

<p>But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</p>

<p>Th’ unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</p>

<p>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</p>

<p>Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</p>

<p>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear. For lo, his sword,</p>

<p>Which was declining on the milky head</p>

<p>Of reverend Priam, seemed i’ th’ air to stick.</p>

<p>So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood</p>

<p>And, like a neutral to his will and matter,</p>

<p>Did nothing.</p>

<p>But as we often see against some storm</p>

<p>A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</p>

<p>The bold winds speechless, and the orb below</p>

<p>As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</p>

<p>Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus’ pause,</p>

<p>Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work,</p>

<p>And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall</p>

<p>On Mars’s armor, forged for proof eterne,</p>

<p>With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword</p>

<p>Now falls on Priam.</p>

<p>Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods</p>

<p>In general synod take away her power,</p>

<p>Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,</p>

<p>And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven</p>

<p>As low as to the fiends!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  This is too long.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  It shall to the barber’s with your beard.–</p>

<p>Prithee say on. He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or</p>

<p>he sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Player</sc></p>

<p>But who, ah woe, had seen the mobled queen–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  “The mobled queen”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  That’s good. “Mobled queen” is good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Player</sc></p>

<p>Run barefoot up and down, threat’ning the flames</p>

<p>With bisson rheum, a clout upon that head</p>

<p>Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,</p>

<p>About her lank and all o’erteemed loins</p>

<p>A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up–</p>

<p>Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steeped,</p>

<p>’Gainst Fortune’s state would treason have</p>

<p>pronounced.</p>

<p>But if the gods themselves did see her then</p>

<p>When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport</p>

<p>In mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs,</p>

<p>The instant burst of clamor that she made</p>

<p>(Unless things mortal move them not at all)</p>

<p>Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven</p>

<p>And passion in the gods.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  Look whe’er he has not turned his color and</p>

<p>has tears in ’s eyes. Prithee, no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  ’Tis well. I’ll have thee speak out the rest of</p>

<p>this soon.–Good my lord, will you see the players</p>

<p>well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used,</p>

<p>for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the</p>

<p>time. After your death you were better have a bad</p>

<p>epitaph than their ill report while you live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  My lord, I will use them according to their</p>

<p>desert.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  God’s bodykins, man, much better! Use every</p>

<p>man after his desert and who shall ’scape</p>

<p>whipping? Use them after your own honor and</p>

<p>dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in</p>

<p>your bounty. Take them in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  Come, sirs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Follow him, friends. We’ll hear a play</p>

<p>tomorrow. <i>[As Polonius and Players exit, Hamlet speaks to</p>

<p>the First Player.]</i> Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can</p>

<p>you play “The Murder of Gonzago”?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Player</sc>  Ay, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  We’ll ha ’t tomorrow night. You could, for a</p>

<p>need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen</p>

<p>lines, which I would set down and insert in ’t,</p>

<p>could you not?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Player</sc>  Ay, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Very well. Follow that lord–and look you</p>

<p>mock him not. <i>[First Player exits.]</i> My good friends,</p>

<p>I’ll leave you till night. You are welcome to Elsinore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Rosencrantz</sc>  Good my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Ay, so, good-bye to you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now I am alone.</p>

<p>O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</p>

<p>Is it not monstrous that this player here,</p>

<p>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</p>

<p>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</p>

<p>That from her working all his visage wanned,</p>

<p>Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,</p>

<p>A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</p>

<p>With forms to his conceit–and all for nothing!</p>

<p>For Hecuba!</p>

<p>What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</p>

<p>That he should weep for her? What would he do</p>

<p>Had he the motive and the cue for passion</p>

<p>That I have? He would drown the stage with tears</p>

<p>And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,</p>

<p>Make mad the guilty and appall the free,</p>

<p>Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed</p>

<p>The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,</p>

<p>A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak</p>

<p>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,</p>

<p>And can say nothing–no, not for a king</p>

<p>Upon whose property and most dear life</p>

<p>A damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?</p>

<p>Who calls me “villain”? breaks my pate across?</p>

<p>Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?</p>

<p>Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i’ th’ throat</p>

<p>As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?</p>

<p>Ha! ’Swounds, I should take it! For it cannot be</p>

<p>But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall</p>

<p>To make oppression bitter, or ere this</p>

<p>I should have fatted all the region kites</p>

<p>With this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!</p>

<p>Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless</p>

<p>villain!</p>

<p>O vengeance!</p>

<p>Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,</p>

<p>That I, the son of a dear father murdered,</p>

<p>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,</p>

<p>Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words</p>

<p>And fall a-cursing like a very drab,</p>

<p>A stallion! Fie upon ’t! Foh!</p>

<p>About, my brains!–Hum, I have heard</p>

<p>That guilty creatures sitting at a play</p>

<p>Have, by the very cunning of the scene,</p>

<p>Been struck so to the soul that presently</p>

<p>They have proclaimed their malefactions;</p>

<p>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak</p>

<p>With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players</p>

<p>Play something like the murder of my father</p>

<p>Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks;</p>

<p>I’ll tent him to the quick. If he do blench,</p>

<p>I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</p>

<p>May be a devil, and the devil hath power</p>

<p>T’ assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,</p>

<p>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</p>

<p>As he is very potent with such spirits,</p>

<p>Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds</p>

<p>More relative than this. The play’s the thing</p>

<p>Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.</p>
