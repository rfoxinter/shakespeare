<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak. I’ll go no</p>

<p>further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc></p>

<p>Mark me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc>  My hour is almost come</p>

<p>When I to sulf’rous and tormenting flames</p>

<p>Must render up myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Alas, poor ghost!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc></p>

<p>Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing</p>

<p>To what I shall unfold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Speak. I am bound to hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc></p>

<p>So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  What?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc>  I am thy father’s spirit,</p>

<p>Doomed for a certain term to walk the night</p>

<p>And for the day confined to fast in fires</p>

<p>Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature</p>

<p>Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid</p>

<p>To tell the secrets of my prison house,</p>

<p>I could a tale unfold whose lightest word</p>

<p>Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,</p>

<p>Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their</p>

<p>spheres,</p>

<p>Thy knotted and combined locks to part,</p>

<p>And each particular hair to stand an end,</p>

<p>Like quills upon the fearful porpentine.</p>

<p>But this eternal blazon must not be</p>

<p>To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O list!</p>

<p>If thou didst ever thy dear father love–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  O God!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc></p>

<p>Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Murder?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc></p>

<p>Murder most foul, as in the best it is,</p>

<p>But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Haste me to know ’t, that I, with wings as swift</p>

<p>As meditation or the thoughts of love,</p>

<p>May sweep to my revenge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc>  I find thee apt;</p>

<p>And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed</p>

<p>That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,</p>

<p>Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.</p>

<p>’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,</p>

<p>A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark</p>

<p>Is by a forged process of my death</p>

<p>Rankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,</p>

<p>The serpent that did sting thy father’s life</p>

<p>Now wears his crown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  O, my prophetic soul! My uncle!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc></p>

<p>Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,</p>

<p>With witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts–</p>

<p>O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power</p>

<p>So to seduce!–won to his shameful lust</p>

<p>The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.</p>

<p>O Hamlet, what a falling off was there!</p>

<p>From me, whose love was of that dignity</p>

<p>That it went hand in hand even with the vow</p>

<p>I made to her in marriage, and to decline</p>

<p>Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor</p>

<p>To those of mine.</p>

<p>But virtue, as it never will be moved,</p>

<p>Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,</p>

<p>So, lust, though to a radiant angel linked,</p>

<p>Will sate itself in a celestial bed</p>

<p>And prey on garbage.</p>

<p>But soft, methinks I scent the morning air.</p>

<p>Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,</p>

<p>My custom always of the afternoon,</p>

<p>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole</p>

<p>With juice of cursed hebona in a vial</p>

<p>And in the porches of my ears did pour</p>

<p>The leprous distilment, whose effect</p>

<p>Holds such an enmity with blood of man</p>

<p>That swift as quicksilver it courses through</p>

<p>The natural gates and alleys of the body,</p>

<p>And with a sudden vigor it doth posset</p>

<p>And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</p>

<p>The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,</p>

<p>And a most instant tetter barked about,</p>

<p>Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust</p>

<p>All my smooth body.</p>

<p>Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand</p>

<p>Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,</p>

<p>Cut off, even in the blossoms of my sin,</p>

<p>Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled,</p>

<p>No reck’ning made, but sent to my account</p>

<p>With all my imperfections on my head.</p>

<p>O horrible, O horrible, most horrible!</p>

<p>If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.</p>

<p>Let not the royal bed of Denmark be</p>

<p>A couch for luxury and damned incest.</p>

<p>But, howsomever thou pursues this act,</p>

<p>Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive</p>

<p>Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven</p>

<p>And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge</p>

<p>To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.</p>

<p>The glowworm shows the matin to be near</p>

<p>And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire.</p>

<p>Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>O all you host of heaven! O Earth! What else?</p>

<p>And shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, my heart,</p>

<p>And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,</p>

<p>But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?</p>

<p>Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat</p>

<p>In this distracted globe. Remember thee?</p>

<p>Yea, from the table of my memory</p>

<p>I’ll wipe away all trivial, fond records,</p>

<p>All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,</p>

<p>That youth and observation copied there,</p>

<p>And thy commandment all alone shall live</p>

<p>Within the book and volume of my brain,</p>

<p>Unmixed with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!</p>

<p>O most pernicious woman!</p>

<p>O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!</p>

<p>My tables–meet it is I set it down</p>

<p>That one may smile and smile and be a villain.</p>

<p>At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.</p>

<p><center><i>[He writes.]</i></center></p>

<p>So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word.</p>

<p>It is “adieu, adieu, remember me.”</p>

<p>I have sworn ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  My lord, my lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  Lord Hamlet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Heavens secure him!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  So be it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  Illo, ho, ho, my lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>How is ’t, my noble lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  What news, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  O, wonderful!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Good my lord, tell it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  No, you will reveal it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Not I, my lord, by heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  Nor I, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>How say you, then? Would heart of man once think</p>

<p>it?</p>

<p>But you’ll be secret?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>/<sc>Marcellus</sc>   <i>Ay, by heaven, my lord.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>There’s never a villain dwelling in all Denmark</p>

<p>But he’s an arrant knave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave</p>

<p>To tell us this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Why, right, you are in the right.</p>

<p>And so, without more circumstance at all,</p>

<p>I hold it fit that we shake hands and part,</p>

<p>You, as your business and desire shall point you</p>

<p>(For every man hath business and desire,</p>

<p>Such as it is), and for my own poor part,</p>

<p>I will go pray.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>I am sorry they offend you, heartily;</p>

<p>Yes, faith, heartily.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  There’s no offense, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,</p>

<p>And much offense, too. Touching this vision here,</p>

<p>It is an honest ghost–that let me tell you.</p>

<p>For your desire to know what is between us,</p>

<p>O’ermaster ’t as you may. And now, good friends,</p>

<p>As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,</p>

<p>Give me one poor request.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  What is ’t, my lord? We will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Never make known what you have seen tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>/<sc>Marcellus</sc>   <i>My lord, we will not.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Nay, but swear ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  In faith, my lord, not I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  Nor I, my lord, in faith.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Upon my sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  We have sworn, my lord, already.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc> <i>[cries under the stage]</i>  Swear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Ha, ha, boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there,</p>

<p>truepenny?</p>

<p>Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.</p>

<p>Consent to swear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Propose the oath, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Never to speak of this that you have seen,</p>

<p>Swear by my sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc> <i>[beneath]</i>  Swear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Hic et ubique? Then we’ll shift our ground.</p>

<p>Come hither, gentlemen,</p>

<p>And lay your hands again upon my sword.</p>

<p>Swear by my sword</p>

<p>Never to speak of this that you have heard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc> <i>[beneath]</i>  Swear by his sword.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Well said, old mole. Canst work i’ th’ earth so fast?–</p>

<p>A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.</p>

<p>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</p>

<p>Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come.</p>

<p>Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,</p>

<p>How strange or odd some’er I bear myself</p>

<p>(As I perchance hereafter shall think meet</p>

<p>To put an antic disposition on)</p>

<p>That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,</p>

<p>With arms encumbered thus, or this headshake,</p>

<p>Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,</p>

<p>As “Well, well, we know,” or “We could an if we</p>

<p>would,”</p>

<p>Or “If we list to speak,” or “There be an if they</p>

<p>might,”</p>

<p>Or such ambiguous giving-out, to note</p>

<p>That you know aught of me–this do swear,</p>

<p>So grace and mercy at your most need help you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc> <i>[beneath]</i>  Swear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Rest, rest, perturbed spirit.–So, gentlemen,</p>

<p>With all my love I do commend me to you,</p>

<p>And what so poor a man as Hamlet is</p>

<p>May do t’ express his love and friending to you,</p>

<p>God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,</p>

<p>And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.</p>

<p>The time is out of joint. O cursed spite</p>

<p>That ever I was born to set it right!</p>

<p>Nay, come, let’s go together.</p>
