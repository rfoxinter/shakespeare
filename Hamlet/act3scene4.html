<p><center><i>[Enter Queen and Polonius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.</p>

<p>Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear</p>

<p>with</p>

<p>And that your Grace hath screened and stood</p>

<p>between</p>

<p>Much heat and him. I’ll silence me even here.</p>

<p>Pray you, be round with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc> <i>[within]</i>  Mother, mother, mother!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  I’ll warrant you. Fear me not. Withdraw,</p>

<p>I hear him coming.</p>

<p><center><i>[Polonius hides behind the arras.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Hamlet.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Now, mother, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Mother, you have my father much offended.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Why, how now, Hamlet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  What’s the matter now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Have you forgot me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  No, by the rood, not so.</p>

<p>You are the Queen, your husband’s brother’s wife,</p>

<p>And (would it were not so) you are my mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Nay, then I’ll set those to you that can speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge.</p>

<p>You go not till I set you up a glass</p>

<p>Where you may see the inmost part of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?</p>

<p>Help, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc> <i>[behind the arras]</i>  What ho! Help!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>How now, a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kills Polonius by thrusting a rapier</p>

<p>through the arras.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc> <i>[behind the arras]</i></p>

<p>O, I am slain!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  O me, what hast thou done?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Nay, I know not. Is it the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>A bloody deed–almost as bad, good mother,</p>

<p>As kill a king and marry with his brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>As kill a king?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Ay, lady, it was my word.</p>

<p><center><i>[He pulls Polonius’ body from behind the arras.]</i></center></p>

<p>Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell.</p>

<p>I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.</p>

<p>Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.</p>

<p><i>[To Queen.]</i> Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit</p>

<p>you down,</p>

<p>And let me wring your heart; for so I shall</p>

<p>If it be made of penetrable stuff,</p>

<p>If damned custom have not brazed it so</p>

<p>That it be proof and bulwark against sense.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>What have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue</p>

<p>In noise so rude against me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Such an act</p>

<p>That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,</p>

<p>Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose</p>

<p>From the fair forehead of an innocent love</p>

<p>And sets a blister there, makes marriage vows</p>

<p>As false as dicers’ oaths–O, such a deed</p>

<p>As from the body of contraction plucks</p>

<p>The very soul, and sweet religion makes</p>

<p>A rhapsody of words! Heaven’s face does glow</p>

<p>O’er this solidity and compound mass</p>

<p>With heated visage, as against the doom,</p>

<p>Is thought-sick at the act.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Ay me, what act</p>

<p>That roars so loud and thunders in the index?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Look here upon this picture and on this,</p>

<p>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</p>

<p>See what a grace was seated on this brow,</p>

<p>Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,</p>

<p>An eye like Mars’ to threaten and command,</p>

<p>A station like the herald Mercury</p>

<p>New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,</p>

<p>A combination and a form indeed</p>

<p>Where every god did seem to set his seal</p>

<p>To give the world assurance of a man.</p>

<p>This was your husband. Look you now what follows.</p>

<p>Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear</p>

<p>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</p>

<p>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed</p>

<p>And batten on this moor? Ha! Have you eyes?</p>

<p>You cannot call it love, for at your age</p>

<p>The heyday in the blood is tame, it’s humble</p>

<p>And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment</p>

<p>Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,</p>

<p>Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense</p>

<p>Is apoplexed; for madness would not err,</p>

<p>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thralled,</p>

<p>But it reserved some quantity of choice</p>

<p>To serve in such a difference. What devil was ’t</p>

<p>That thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind?</p>

<p>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,</p>

<p>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</p>

<p>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</p>

<p>Could not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?</p>

<p>Rebellious hell,</p>

<p>If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,</p>

<p>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax</p>

<p>And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame</p>

<p>When the compulsive ardor gives the charge,</p>

<p>Since frost itself as actively doth burn,</p>

<p>And reason panders will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  O Hamlet, speak no more!</p>

<p>Thou turn’st my eyes into my very soul,</p>

<p>And there I see such black and grained spots</p>

<p>As will not leave their tinct.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Nay, but to live</p>

<p>In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,</p>

<p>Stewed in corruption, honeying and making love</p>

<p>Over the nasty sty!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  O, speak to me no more!</p>

<p>These words like daggers enter in my ears.</p>

<p>No more, sweet Hamlet!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  A murderer and a villain,</p>

<p>A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe</p>

<p>Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings,</p>

<p>A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,</p>

<p>That from a shelf the precious diadem stole</p>

<p>And put it in his pocket–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  No more!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  A king of shreds and patches–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ghost.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Save me and hover o’er me with your wings,</p>

<p>You heavenly guards!–What would your gracious</p>

<p>figure?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Alas, he’s mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Do you not come your tardy son to chide,</p>

<p>That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by</p>

<p>Th’ important acting of your dread command?</p>

<p>O, say!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ghost</sc>  Do not forget. This visitation</p>

<p>Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.</p>

<p>But look, amazement on thy mother sits.</p>

<p>O, step between her and her fighting soul.</p>

<p>Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.</p>

<p>Speak to her, Hamlet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  How is it with you, lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Alas, how is ’t with you,</p>

<p>That you do bend your eye on vacancy</p>

<p>And with th’ incorporal air do hold discourse?</p>

<p>Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,</p>

<p>And, as the sleeping soldiers in th’ alarm,</p>

<p>Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,</p>

<p>Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,</p>

<p>Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper</p>

<p>Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares.</p>

<p>His form and cause conjoined, preaching to stones,</p>

<p>Would make them capable. <i>[To the Ghost.]</i> Do not</p>

<p>look upon me,</p>

<p>Lest with this piteous action you convert</p>

<p>My stern effects. Then what I have to do</p>

<p>Will want true color–tears perchance for blood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  To whom do you speak this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Do you see nothing there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Nor did you nothing hear?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  No, nothing but ourselves.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Why, look you there, look how it steals away!</p>

<p>My father, in his habit as he lived!</p>

<p>Look where he goes even now out at the portal!</p>

<p><center><i>[Ghost exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>This is the very coinage of your brain.</p>

<p>This bodiless creation ecstasy</p>

<p>Is very cunning in.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Ecstasy?</p>

<p>My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time</p>

<p>And makes as healthful music. It is not madness</p>

<p>That I have uttered. Bring me to the test,</p>

<p>And I the matter will reword, which madness</p>

<p>Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,</p>

<p>Lay not that flattering unction to your soul</p>

<p>That not your trespass but my madness speaks.</p>

<p>It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,</p>

<p>Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,</p>

<p>Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,</p>

<p>Repent what’s past, avoid what is to come,</p>

<p>And do not spread the compost on the weeds</p>

<p>To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue,</p>

<p>For, in the fatness of these pursy times,</p>

<p>Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,</p>

<p>Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>O, throw away the worser part of it,</p>

<p>And live the purer with the other half!</p>

<p>Good night. But go not to my uncle’s bed.</p>

<p>Assume a virtue if you have it not.</p>

<p>That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,</p>

<p>Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,</p>

<p>That to the use of actions fair and good</p>

<p>He likewise gives a frock or livery</p>

<p>That aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,</p>

<p>And that shall lend a kind of easiness</p>

<p>To the next abstinence, the next more easy;</p>

<p>For use almost can change the stamp of nature</p>

<p>And either ... the devil or throw him out</p>

<p>With wondrous potency. Once more, good night,</p>

<p>And, when you are desirous to be blest,</p>

<p>I’ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord</p>

<p><center><i>[Pointing to Polonius.]</i></center></p>

<p>I do repent; but heaven hath pleased it so</p>

<p>To punish me with this and this with me,</p>

<p>That I must be their scourge and minister.</p>

<p>I will bestow him and will answer well</p>

<p>The death I gave him. So, again, good night.</p>

<p>I must be cruel only to be kind.</p>

<p>This bad begins, and worse remains behind.</p>

<p>One word more, good lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  What shall I do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Not this by no means that I bid you do:</p>

<p>Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed,</p>

<p>Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,</p>

<p>And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses</p>

<p>Or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers,</p>

<p>Make you to ravel all this matter out</p>

<p>That I essentially am not in madness,</p>

<p>But mad in craft. ’Twere good you let him know,</p>

<p>For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,</p>

<p>Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,</p>

<p>Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?</p>

<p>No, in despite of sense and secrecy,</p>

<p>Unpeg the basket on the house’s top,</p>

<p>Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,</p>

<p>To try conclusions, in the basket creep</p>

<p>And break your own neck down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Be thou assured, if words be made of breath</p>

<p>And breath of life, I have no life to breathe</p>

<p>What thou hast said to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>I must to England, you know that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Alack,</p>

<p>I had forgot! ’Tis so concluded on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>There’s letters sealed; and my two schoolfellows,</p>

<p>Whom I will trust as I will adders fanged,</p>

<p>They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way</p>

<p>And marshal me to knavery. Let it work,</p>

<p>For ’tis the sport to have the enginer</p>

<p>Hoist with his own petard; and ’t shall go hard</p>

<p>But I will delve one yard below their mines</p>

<p>And blow them at the moon. O, ’tis most sweet</p>

<p>When in one line two crafts directly meet.</p>

<p>This man shall set me packing.</p>

<p>I’ll lug the guts into the neighbor room.</p>

<p>Mother, good night indeed. This counselor</p>

<p>Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,</p>

<p>Who was in life a foolish prating knave.–</p>

<p>Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.–</p>

<p>Good night, mother.</p>
