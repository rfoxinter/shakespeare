<p><center><i>[Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and</p>

<p>Guildenstern.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>There’s matter in these sighs; these profound heaves</p>

<p>You must translate; ’tis fit we understand them.</p>

<p>Where is your son?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>Bestow this place on us a little while.</p>

<p><center><i>[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen tonight!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>Mad as the sea and wind when both contend</p>

<p>Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit,</p>

<p>Behind the arras hearing something stir,</p>

<p>Whips out his rapier, cries “A rat, a rat,”</p>

<p>And in this brainish apprehension kills</p>

<p>The unseen good old man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  O heavy deed!</p>

<p>It had been so with us, had we been there.</p>

<p>His liberty is full of threats to all–</p>

<p>To you yourself, to us, to everyone.</p>

<p>Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?</p>

<p>It will be laid to us, whose providence</p>

<p>Should have kept short, restrained, and out of haunt</p>

<p>This mad young man. But so much was our love,</p>

<p>We would not understand what was most fit,</p>

<p>But, like the owner of a foul disease,</p>

<p>To keep it from divulging, let it feed</p>

<p>Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>To draw apart the body he hath killed,</p>

<p>O’er whom his very madness, like some ore</p>

<p>Among a mineral of metals base,</p>

<p>Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  O Gertrude, come away!</p>

<p>The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch</p>

<p>But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed</p>

<p>We must with all our majesty and skill</p>

<p>Both countenance and excuse.–Ho, Guildenstern!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Friends both, go join you with some further aid.</p>

<p>Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,</p>

<p>And from his mother’s closet hath he dragged him.</p>

<p>Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body</p>

<p>Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.</p>

<p><center><i>[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Come, Gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest friends</p>

<p>And let them know both what we mean to do</p>

<p>And what’s untimely done. ...</p>

<p>Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter,</p>

<p>As level as the cannon to his blank</p>

<p>Transports his poisoned shot, may miss our name</p>

<p>And hit the woundless air. O, come away!</p>

<p>My soul is full of discord and dismay.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
