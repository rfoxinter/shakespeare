<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  What are they that would speak with me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Seafaring men, sir. They say they have</p>

<p>letters for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  Let them come in. <i>[Gentleman exits.]</i> I do not</p>

<p>know from what part of the world I should be</p>

<p>greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sailors.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sailor</span>  God bless you, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  Let Him bless thee too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Sailor</span>  He shall, sir, an ’t please Him. There’s a letter</p>

<p>for you, sir. It came from th’ ambassador that was</p>

<p>bound for England–if your name be Horatio, as I</p>

<p>am let to know it is.     <i><i>[He hands Horatio a letter.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span> <i>[reads the letter]</i>  Horatio, when thou shalt have</p>

<p>overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the</p>

<p>King. They have letters for him. Ere we were two days</p>

<p>old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave</p>

<p>us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on</p>

<p>a compelled valor, and in the grapple I boarded them.</p>

<p>On the instant, they got clear of our ship; so I alone</p>

<p>became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like</p>

<p>thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am to</p>

<p>do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters</p>

<p>I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed</p>

<p>as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in</p>

<p>thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too</p>

<p>light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows</p>

<p>will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</p>

<p>hold their course for England; of them I have</p>

<p>much to tell thee. Farewell.</p>

<p>He that thou knowest thine,</p>

<p>Hamlet.</p>

<p>Come, I will give you way for these your letters</p>

<p>And do ’t the speedier that you may direct me</p>

<p>To him from whom you brought them.</p>
