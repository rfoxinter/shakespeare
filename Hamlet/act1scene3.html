<p><center><i>[Enter Laertes and Ophelia, his sister.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>My necessaries are embarked. Farewell.</p>

<p>And, sister, as the winds give benefit</p>

<p>And convey is assistant, do not sleep,</p>

<p>But let me hear from you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  Do you doubt that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favor,</p>

<p>Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,</p>

<p>A violet in the youth of primy nature,</p>

<p>Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,</p>

<p>The perfume and suppliance of a minute,</p>

<p>No more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  No more but so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  Think it no more.</p>

<p>For nature, crescent, does not grow alone</p>

<p>In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,</p>

<p>The inward service of the mind and soul</p>

<p>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</p>

<p>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</p>

<p>The virtue of his will; but you must fear,</p>

<p>His greatness weighed, his will is not his own,</p>

<p>For he himself is subject to his birth.</p>

<p>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</p>

<p>Carve for himself, for on his choice depends</p>

<p>The safety and the health of this whole state.</p>

<p>And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</p>

<p>Unto the voice and yielding of that body</p>

<p>Whereof he is the head. Then, if he says he loves</p>

<p>you,</p>

<p>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</p>

<p>As he in his particular act and place</p>

<p>May give his saying deed, which is no further</p>

<p>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</p>

<p>Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain</p>

<p>If with too credent ear you list his songs</p>

<p>Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open</p>

<p>To his unmastered importunity.</p>

<p>Fear it, Ophelia; fear it, my dear sister,</p>

<p>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</p>

<p>Out of the shot and danger of desire.</p>

<p>The chariest maid is prodigal enough</p>

<p>If she unmask her beauty to the moon.</p>

<p>Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes.</p>

<p>The canker galls the infants of the spring</p>

<p>Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,</p>

<p>And, in the morn and liquid dew of youth,</p>

<p>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</p>

<p>Be wary, then; best safety lies in fear.</p>

<p>Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc></p>

<p>I shall the effect of this good lesson keep</p>

<p>As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,</p>

<p>Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,</p>

<p>Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,</p>

<p>Whiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine,</p>

<p>Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads</p>

<p>And recks not his own rede.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  O, fear me not.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Polonius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>I stay too long. But here my father comes.</p>

<p>A double blessing is a double grace.</p>

<p>Occasion smiles upon a second leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!</p>

<p>The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,</p>

<p>And you are stayed for. There, my blessing with</p>

<p>thee.</p>

<p>And these few precepts in thy memory</p>

<p>Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,</p>

<p>Nor any unproportioned thought his act.</p>

<p>Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.</p>

<p>Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,</p>

<p>Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,</p>

<p>But do not dull thy palm with entertainment</p>

<p>Of each new-hatched, unfledged courage. Beware</p>

<p>Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,</p>

<p>Bear ’t that th’ opposed may beware of thee.</p>

<p>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice.</p>

<p>Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.</p>

<p>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</p>

<p>But not expressed in fancy (rich, not gaudy),</p>

<p>For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</p>

<p>And they in France of the best rank and station</p>

<p>Are of a most select and generous chief in that.</p>

<p>Neither a borrower nor a lender be,</p>

<p>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,</p>

<p>And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.</p>

<p>This above all: to thine own self be true,</p>

<p>And it must follow, as the night the day,</p>

<p>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</p>

<p>Farewell. My blessing season this in thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>The time invests you. Go, your servants tend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well</p>

<p>What I have said to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  ’Tis in my memory locked,</p>

<p>And you yourself shall keep the key of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  Farewell.     <i><i>[Laertes exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>What is ’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc></p>

<p>So please you, something touching the Lord</p>

<p>Hamlet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc>  Marry, well bethought.</p>

<p>’Tis told me he hath very oft of late</p>

<p>Given private time to you, and you yourself</p>

<p>Have of your audience been most free and</p>

<p>bounteous.</p>

<p>If it be so (as so ’tis put on me,</p>

<p>And that in way of caution), I must tell you</p>

<p>You do not understand yourself so clearly</p>

<p>As it behooves my daughter and your honor.</p>

<p>What is between you? Give me up the truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc></p>

<p>He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders</p>

<p>Of his affection to me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Affection, puh! You speak like a green girl</p>

<p>Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.</p>

<p>Do you believe his “tenders,” as you call them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc></p>

<p>I do not know, my lord, what I should think.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Marry, I will teach you. Think yourself a baby</p>

<p>That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay,</p>

<p>Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,</p>

<p>Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,</p>

<p>Running it thus) you’ll tender me a fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc></p>

<p>My lord, he hath importuned me with love</p>

<p>In honorable fashion–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Ay, “fashion” you may call it. Go to, go to!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc></p>

<p>And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,</p>

<p>With almost all the holy vows of heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,</p>

<p>When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul</p>

<p>Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,</p>

<p>Giving more light than heat, extinct in both</p>

<p>Even in their promise as it is a-making,</p>

<p>You must not take for fire. From this time</p>

<p>Be something scanter of your maiden presence.</p>

<p>Set your entreatments at a higher rate</p>

<p>Than a command to parle. For Lord Hamlet,</p>

<p>Believe so much in him that he is young,</p>

<p>And with a larger tether may he walk</p>

<p>Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,</p>

<p>Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,</p>

<p>Not of that dye which their investments show,</p>

<p>But mere implorators of unholy suits,</p>

<p>Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds</p>

<p>The better to beguile. This is for all:</p>

<p>I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth</p>

<p>Have you so slander any moment leisure</p>

<p>As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.</p>

<p>Look to ’t, I charge you. Come your ways.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Ophelia</sc>  I shall obey, my lord.</p>
