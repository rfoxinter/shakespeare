<p><center><i>[Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>It is a nipping and an eager air.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  What hour now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  I think it lacks of twelve.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  No, it is struck.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Indeed, I heard it not. It then draws near the season</p>

<p>Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.</p>

<p><center><i>[A flourish of trumpets and two pieces goes off.]</i></center></p>

<p>What does this mean, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,</p>

<p>Keeps wassail, and the swagg’ring upspring reels;</p>

<p>And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,</p>

<p>The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out</p>

<p>The triumph of his pledge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Is it a custom?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Ay, marry, is ’t,</p>

<p>But, to my mind, though I am native here</p>

<p>And to the manner born, it is a custom</p>

<p>More honored in the breach than the observance.</p>

<p>This heavy-headed revel east and west</p>

<p>Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations.</p>

<p>They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase</p>

<p>Soil our addition. And, indeed, it takes</p>

<p>From our achievements, though performed at</p>

<p>height,</p>

<p>The pith and marrow of our attribute.</p>

<p>So oft it chances in particular men</p>

<p>That for some vicious mole of nature in them,</p>

<p>As in their birth (wherein they are not guilty,</p>

<p>Since nature cannot choose his origin),</p>

<p>By the o’ergrowth of some complexion</p>

<p>(Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason),</p>

<p>Or by some habit that too much o’erleavens</p>

<p>The form of plausive manners–that these men,</p>

<p>Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,</p>

<p>Being nature’s livery or fortune’s star,</p>

<p>His virtues else, be they as pure as grace,</p>

<p>As infinite as man may undergo,</p>

<p>Shall in the general censure take corruption</p>

<p>From that particular fault. The dram of evil</p>

<p>Doth all the noble substance of a doubt</p>

<p>To his own scandal.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Ghost.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Look, my lord, it comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Angels and ministers of grace, defend us!</p>

<p>Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned,</p>

<p>Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from</p>

<p>hell,</p>

<p>Be thy intents wicked or charitable,</p>

<p>Thou com’st in such a questionable shape</p>

<p>That I will speak to thee. I’ll call thee “Hamlet,”</p>

<p>“King,” “Father,” “Royal Dane.” O, answer me!</p>

<p>Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell</p>

<p>Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,</p>

<p>Have burst their cerements; why the sepulcher,</p>

<p>Wherein we saw thee quietly interred,</p>

<p>Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws</p>

<p>To cast thee up again. What may this mean</p>

<p>That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,</p>

<p>Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,</p>

<p>Making night hideous, and we fools of nature</p>

<p>So horridly to shake our disposition</p>

<p>With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?</p>

<p>Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?</p>

<p><center><i>[Ghost beckons.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>It beckons you to go away with it</p>

<p>As if it some impartment did desire</p>

<p>To you alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  Look with what courteous action</p>

<p>It waves you to a more removed ground.</p>

<p>But do not go with it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  No, by no means.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>It will not speak. Then I will follow it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Do not, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Why, what should be the fear?</p>

<p>I do not set my life at a pin’s fee.</p>

<p>And for my soul, what can it do to that,</p>

<p>Being a thing immortal as itself?</p>

<p>It waves me forth again. I’ll follow it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord?</p>

<p>Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff</p>

<p>That beetles o’er his base into the sea,</p>

<p>And there assume some other horrible form</p>

<p>Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason</p>

<p>And draw you into madness? Think of it.</p>

<p>The very place puts toys of desperation,</p>

<p>Without more motive, into every brain</p>

<p>That looks so many fathoms to the sea</p>

<p>And hears it roar beneath.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>It waves me still.–Go on, I’ll follow thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>You shall not go, my lord.     <i><i>[They hold back Hamlet.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Hold off your hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Be ruled. You shall not go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  My fate cries out</p>

<p>And makes each petty arture in this body</p>

<p>As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.</p>

<p>Still am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen.</p>

<p>By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me!</p>

<p>I say, away!–Go on. I’ll follow thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[Ghost and Hamlet exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>He waxes desperate with imagination.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>Let’s follow. ’Tis not fit thus to obey him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Have after. To what issue will this come?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Heaven will direct it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  Nay, let’s follow him.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
