<p><center><i>[Enter Hamlet and Horatio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>So much for this, sir. Now shall you see the other.</p>

<p>You do remember all the circumstance?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  Remember it, my lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting</p>

<p>That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay</p>

<p>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly–</p>

<p>And praised be rashness for it; let us know,</p>

<p>Our indiscretion sometime serves us well</p>

<p>When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn</p>

<p>us</p>

<p>There’s a divinity that shapes our ends,</p>

<p>Rough-hew them how we will–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  That is most</p>

<p>certain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Up from my cabin,</p>

<p>My sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark</p>

<p>Groped I to find out them; had my desire,</p>

<p>Fingered their packet, and in fine withdrew</p>

<p>To mine own room again, making so bold</p>

<p>(My fears forgetting manners) to unfold</p>

<p>Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,</p>

<p>A royal knavery–an exact command,</p>

<p>Larded with many several sorts of reasons</p>

<p>Importing Denmark’s health and England’s too,</p>

<p>With–ho!–such bugs and goblins in my life,</p>

<p>That on the supervise, no leisure bated,</p>

<p>No, not to stay the grinding of the ax,</p>

<p>My head should be struck off.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  Is ’t possible?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>Here’s the commission. Read it at more leisure.</p>

<p><center><i>[Handing him a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>But wilt thou hear now how I did proceed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  I beseech you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>Being thus benetted round with villainies,</p>

<p>Or I could make a prologue to my brains,</p>

<p>They had begun the play. I sat me down,</p>

<p>Devised a new commission, wrote it fair–</p>

<p>I once did hold it, as our statists do,</p>

<p>A baseness to write fair, and labored much</p>

<p>How to forget that learning; but, sir, now</p>

<p>It did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know</p>

<p>Th’ effect of what I wrote?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  Ay, good my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>An earnest conjuration from the King,</p>

<p>As England was his faithful tributary,</p>

<p>As love between them like the palm might flourish,</p>

<p>As peace should still her wheaten garland wear</p>

<p>And stand a comma ’tween their amities,</p>

<p>And many suchlike ases of great charge,</p>

<p>That, on the view and knowing of these contents,</p>

<p>Without debatement further, more or less,</p>

<p>He should those bearers put to sudden death,</p>

<p>Not shriving time allowed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  How was this sealed?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.</p>

<p>I had my father’s signet in my purse,</p>

<p>Which was the model of that Danish seal;</p>

<p>Folded the writ up in the form of th’ other,</p>

<p>Subscribed it, gave ’t th’ impression, placed it</p>

<p>safely,</p>

<p>The changeling never known. Now, the next day</p>

<p>Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent</p>

<p>Thou knowest already.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span></p>

<p>So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>Why, man, they did make love to this employment.</p>

<p>They are not near my conscience. Their defeat</p>

<p>Does by their own insinuation grow.</p>

<p>’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes</p>

<p>Between the pass and fell incensed points</p>

<p>Of mighty opposites.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  Why, what a king is this!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon–</p>

<p>He that hath killed my king and whored my mother,</p>

<p>Popped in between th’ election and my hopes,</p>

<p>Thrown out his angle for my proper life,</p>

<p>And with such cozenage–is ’t not perfect</p>

<p>conscience</p>

<p>To quit him with this arm? And is ’t not to be</p>

<p>damned</p>

<p>To let this canker of our nature come</p>

<p>In further evil?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span></p>

<p>It must be shortly known to him from England</p>

<p>What is the issue of the business there.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>It will be short. The interim’s mine,</p>

<p>And a man’s life’s no more than to say “one.”</p>

<p>But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</p>

<p>That to Laertes I forgot myself,</p>

<p>For by the image of my cause I see</p>

<p>The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favors.</p>

<p>But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me</p>

<p>Into a tow’ring passion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  Peace, who comes here?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Osric, a courtier.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  Your Lordship is right welcome back to</p>

<p>Denmark.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  I humbly thank you, sir. <i>[Aside to Horatio.]</i></p>

<p>Dost know this waterfly?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span> <i>[aside to Hamlet]</i>  No, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span> <i>[aside to Horatio]</i>  Thy state is the more gracious,</p>

<p>for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much</p>

<p>land, and fertile. Let a beast be lord of beasts and his</p>

<p>crib shall stand at the king’s mess. ’Tis a chough,</p>

<p>but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  Sweet lord, if your Lordship were at leisure, I</p>

<p>should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of</p>

<p>spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use: ’tis for the</p>

<p>head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  I thank your Lordship; it is very hot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  No, believe me, ’tis very cold; the wind is</p>

<p>northerly.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for</p>

<p>my complexion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as</p>

<p>’twere–I cannot tell how. My lord, his Majesty</p>

<p>bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager</p>

<p>on your head. Sir, this is the matter–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  I beseech you, remember. <i>[He motions to</p>

<p>Osric to put on his hat.]</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith.</p>

<p>Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes–believe</p>

<p>me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent</p>

<p>differences, of very soft society and great showing.</p>

<p>Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or</p>

<p>calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the</p>

<p>continent of what part a gentleman would see.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in</p>

<p>you, though I know to divide him inventorially</p>

<p>would dozy th’ arithmetic of memory, and yet but</p>

<p>yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the</p>

<p>verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great</p>

<p>article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness</p>

<p>as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his</p>

<p>mirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage,</p>

<p>nothing more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  Your Lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the</p>

<p>gentleman in our more rawer breath?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  Sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  Is ’t not possible to understand in another</p>

<p>tongue? You will to ’t, sir, really.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span> <i>[to Osric]</i>  What imports the nomination of</p>

<p>this gentleman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  Of Laertes?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  His purse is empty already; all ’s golden words</p>

<p>are spent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Of him, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  I know you are not ignorant–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  I would you did, sir. Yet, in faith, if you did, it</p>

<p>would not much approve me. Well, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes</p>

<p>is–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  I dare not confess that, lest I should compare</p>

<p>with him in excellence. But to know a man well</p>

<p>were to know himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  I mean, sir, for his weapon. But in the imputation</p>

<p>laid on him by them, in his meed he’s</p>

<p>unfellowed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  What’s his weapon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  Rapier and dagger.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  That’s two of his weapons. But, well–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  The King, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary</p>

<p>horses, against the which he has impawned, as I</p>

<p>take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their</p>

<p>assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the</p>

<p>carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very</p>

<p>responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and</p>

<p>of very liberal conceit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  What call you the “carriages”?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  I knew you must be edified by the margent</p>

<p>ere you had done.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  The phrase would be more germane to the</p>

<p>matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides. I</p>

<p>would it might be “hangers” till then. But on. Six</p>

<p>Barbary horses against six French swords, their</p>

<p>assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages–</p>

<p>that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this</p>

<p>all “impawned,” as you call it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  The King, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozen</p>

<p>passes between yourself and him, he shall not</p>

<p>exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for</p>

<p>nine, and it would come to immediate trial if your</p>

<p>Lordship would vouchsafe the answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  How if I answer no?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person</p>

<p>in trial.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his</p>

<p>Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let</p>

<p>the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the</p>

<p>King hold his purpose, I will win for him, an I can.</p>

<p>If not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd</p>

<p>hits.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  Shall I deliver you e’en so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  To this effect, sir, after what flourish your</p>

<p>nature will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  I commend my duty to your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Yours. <i>[Osric exits.]</i> He does well to commend</p>

<p>it himself. There are no tongues else for ’s</p>

<p>turn.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  This lapwing runs away with the shell on his</p>

<p>head.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  He did comply, sir, with his dug before he</p>

<p>sucked it. Thus has he (and many more of the same</p>

<p>breed that I know the drossy age dotes on) only got</p>

<p>the tune of the time, and, out of an habit of</p>

<p>encounter, a kind of yeasty collection, which carries</p>

<p>them through and through the most fanned</p>

<p>and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to</p>

<p>their trial, the bubbles are out.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Lord.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span>  My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by</p>

<p>young Osric, who brings back to him that you</p>

<p>attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your</p>

<p>pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will</p>

<p>take longer time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  I am constant to my purposes. They follow</p>

<p>the King’s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is</p>

<p>ready now or whensoever, provided I be so able as</p>

<p>now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span>  The King and Queen and all are coming down.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  In happy time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lord</span>  The Queen desires you to use some gentle</p>

<p>entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  She well instructs me.     <i><i>[Lord exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  You will lose, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  I do not think so. Since he went into France, I</p>

<p>have been in continual practice. I shall win at the</p>

<p>odds; but thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here</p>

<p>about my heart. But it is no matter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  Nay, good my lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of</p>

<p>gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will</p>

<p>forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Not a whit. We defy augury. There is a</p>

<p>special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be</p>

<p>now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be</p>

<p>now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The</p>

<p>readiness is all. Since no man of aught he leaves</p>

<p>knows, what is ’t to leave betimes? Let be.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[A table prepared. Enter Trumpets, Drums, and Officers</p>

<p>with cushions, King, Queen, Osric, and all the state,</p>

<p>foils, daggers, flagons of wine, and Laertes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Come, Hamlet, come and take this hand from me.</p>

<p><center><i>[He puts Laertes’ hand into Hamlet’s.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span> <i>[to Laertes]</i></p>

<p>Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;</p>

<p>But pardon ’t as you are a gentleman. This presence</p>

<p>knows,</p>

<p>And you must needs have heard, how I am punished</p>

<p>With a sore distraction. What I have done</p>

<p>That might your nature, honor, and exception</p>

<p>Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.</p>

<p>Was ’t Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet.</p>

<p>If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,</p>

<p>And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,</p>

<p>Then Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.</p>

<p>Who does it, then? His madness. If ’t be so,</p>

<p>Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged;</p>

<p>His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.</p>

<p>Sir, in this audience</p>

<p>Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil</p>

<p>Free me so far in your most generous thoughts</p>

<p>That I have shot my arrow o’er the house</p>

<p>And hurt my brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span>  I am satisfied in nature,</p>

<p>Whose motive in this case should stir me most</p>

<p>To my revenge; but in my terms of honor</p>

<p>I stand aloof and will no reconcilement</p>

<p>Till by some elder masters of known honor</p>

<p>I have a voice and precedent of peace</p>

<p>To keep my name ungored. But till that time</p>

<p>I do receive your offered love like love</p>

<p>And will not wrong it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  I embrace it freely</p>

<p>And will this brothers’ wager frankly play.–</p>

<p>Give us the foils. Come on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span>  Come, one for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>I’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance</p>

<p>Your skill shall, like a star i’ th’ darkest night,</p>

<p>Stick fiery off indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span>  You mock me, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  No, by this hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,</p>

<p>You know the wager?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Very well, my lord.</p>

<p>Your Grace has laid the odds o’ th’ weaker side.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>I do not fear it; I have seen you both.</p>

<p>But, since he is better, we have therefore odds.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span></p>

<p>This is too heavy. Let me see another.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>This likes me well. These foils have all a length?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  Ay, my good lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[Prepare to play.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.–</p>

<p>If Hamlet give the first or second hit</p>

<p>Or quit in answer of the third exchange,</p>

<p>Let all the battlements their ordnance fire.</p>

<p>The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath,</p>

<p>And in the cup an union shall he throw,</p>

<p>Richer than that which four successive kings</p>

<p>In Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups,</p>

<p>And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,</p>

<p>The trumpet to the cannoneer without,</p>

<p>The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,</p>

<p>“Now the King drinks to Hamlet.” Come, begin.</p>

<p>And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.</p>

<p><center><i>[Trumpets the while.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Come on, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span>  Come, my lord.     <i><i>[They play.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  One.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Judgment!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  A hit, a very palpable hit.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span>  Well, again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Stay, give me drink.–Hamlet, this pearl is thine.</p>

<p>Here’s to thy health.</p>

<p><center><i>[He drinks and then drops the pearl in the cup.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Drum, trumpets, and shot.]</i></center></p>

<p>Give him the cup.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>I’ll play this bout first. Set it by awhile.</p>

<p>Come. <i>[They play.]</i> Another hit. What say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span></p>

<p>A touch, a touch. I do confess ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>Our son shall win.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span>  He’s fat and scant of breath.–</p>

<p>Here, Hamlet, take my napkin; rub thy brows.</p>

<p>The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.</p>

<p><center><i>[She lifts the cup.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Good madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Gertrude, do not drink.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.     <i><i>[She drinks.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>It is the poisoned cup. It is too late.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>I dare not drink yet, madam–by and by.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span>  Come, let me wipe thy face.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span> <i>[to Claudius]</i></p>

<p>My lord, I’ll hit him now.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  I do not think ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>And yet it is almost against my conscience.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>Come, for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.</p>

<p>I pray you pass with your best violence.</p>

<p>I am afeard you make a wanton of me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span>  Say you so? Come on.     <i><i>[Play.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  Nothing neither way.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span>  Have at you now!</p>

<p><center><i>[Laertes wounds Hamlet. Then in scuffling they change</p>

<p>rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  Part them. They are incensed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  Nay, come again.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Queen falls.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  Look to the Queen there, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span></p>

<p>They bleed on both sides.–How is it, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span>  How is ’t, Laertes?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span></p>

<p>Why as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.</p>

<p><center><i>[He falls.]</i></center></p>

<p>I am justly killed with mine own treachery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>How does the Queen?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span>  She swoons to see them bleed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Queen</span></p>

<p>No, no, the drink, the drink! O, my dear Hamlet!</p>

<p>The drink, the drink! I am poisoned.     <i><i>[She dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>O villainy! Ho! Let the door be locked.     <i><i>[Osric exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Treachery! Seek it out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span></p>

<p>It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.</p>

<p>No med’cine in the world can do thee good.</p>

<p>In thee there is not half an hour’s life.</p>

<p>The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,</p>

<p>Unbated and envenomed. The foul practice</p>

<p>Hath turned itself on me. Lo, here I lie,</p>

<p>Never to rise again. Thy mother’s poisoned.</p>

<p>I can no more. The King, the King’s to blame.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>The point envenomed too! Then, venom, to thy</p>

<p>work.     <i><i>[Hurts the King.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span>  Treason, treason!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>King</span></p>

<p>O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>Here, thou incestuous, murd’rous, damned Dane,</p>

<p>Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?</p>

<p><center><i>[Forcing him to drink the poison.]</i></center></p>

<p>Follow my mother.     <i><i>[King dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Laertes</span>  He is justly served.</p>

<p>It is a poison tempered by himself.</p>

<p>Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.</p>

<p>Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee,</p>

<p>Nor thine on me.     <i><i>[Dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span></p>

<p>Heaven make thee free of it. I follow thee.–</p>

<p>I am dead, Horatio.–Wretched queen, adieu.–</p>

<p>You that look pale and tremble at this chance,</p>

<p>That are but mutes or audience to this act,</p>

<p>Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,</p>

<p>Is strict in his arrest), O, I could tell you–</p>

<p>But let it be.–Horatio, I am dead.</p>

<p>Thou livest; report me and my cause aright</p>

<p>To the unsatisfied.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  Never believe it.</p>

<p>I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.</p>

<p>Here’s yet some liquor left.     <i><i>[He picks up the cup.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  As thou ’rt a man,</p>

<p>Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I’ll ha ’t.</p>

<p>O God, Horatio, what a wounded name,</p>

<p>Things standing thus unknown, shall I leave behind</p>

<p>me!</p>

<p>If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,</p>

<p>Absent thee from felicity awhile</p>

<p>And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain</p>

<p>To tell my story.</p>

<p><center><i>[A march afar off and shot within.]</i></center></p>

<p>What warlike noise is this?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Osric.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Osric</span></p>

<p>Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,</p>

<p>To th’ ambassadors of England gives</p>

<p>This warlike volley.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>  O, I die, Horatio!</p>

<p>The potent poison quite o’ercrows my spirit.</p>

<p>I cannot live to hear the news from England.</p>

<p>But I do prophesy th’ election lights</p>

<p>On Fortinbras; he has my dying voice.</p>

<p>So tell him, with th’ occurrents, more and less,</p>

<p>Which have solicited–the rest is silence.</p>

<p>O, O, O, O!     <i><i>[Dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span></p>

<p>Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,</p>

<p>And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.</p>

<p><center><i>[March within.]</i></center></p>

<p>Why does the drum come hither?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fortinbras with the English Ambassadors with</p>

<p>Drum, Colors, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fortinbras</span>  Where is this sight?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  What is it you would see?</p>

<p>If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fortinbras</span></p>

<p>This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,</p>

<p>What feast is toward in thine eternal cell</p>

<p>That thou so many princes at a shot</p>

<p>So bloodily hast struck?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Ambassador</span>  The sight is dismal,</p>

<p>And our affairs from England come too late.</p>

<p>The ears are senseless that should give us hearing</p>

<p>To tell him his commandment is fulfilled,</p>

<p>That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.</p>

<p>Where should we have our thanks?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span>  Not from his</p>

<p>mouth,</p>

<p>Had it th’ ability of life to thank you.</p>

<p>He never gave commandment for their death.</p>

<p>But since, so jump upon this bloody question,</p>

<p>You from the Polack wars, and you from England,</p>

<p>Are here arrived, give order that these bodies</p>

<p>High on a stage be placed to the view,</p>

<p>And let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world</p>

<p>How these things came about. So shall you hear</p>

<p>Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,</p>

<p>Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,</p>

<p>Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,</p>

<p>And, in this upshot, purposes mistook</p>

<p>Fall’n on th’ inventors’ heads. All this can I</p>

<p>Truly deliver.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fortinbras</span>  Let us haste to hear it</p>

<p>And call the noblest to the audience.</p>

<p>For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.</p>

<p>I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,</p>

<p>Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Horatio</span></p>

<p>Of that I shall have also cause to speak,</p>

<p>And from his mouth whose voice will draw on</p>

<p>more.</p>

<p>But let this same be presently performed</p>

<p>Even while men’s minds are wild, lest more</p>

<p>mischance</p>

<p>On plots and errors happen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fortinbras</span>  Let four captains</p>

<p>Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,</p>

<p>For he was likely, had he been put on,</p>

<p>To have proved most royal; and for his passage,</p>

<p>The soldier’s music and the rite of war</p>

<p>Speak loudly for him.</p>

<p>Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this</p>

<p>Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.</p>

<p>Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit, marching, after the which, a peal of</p>

<p>ordnance are shot off.]</i></center></p>
