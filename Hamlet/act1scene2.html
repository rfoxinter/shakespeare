<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the</p>

<p>Queen, the Council, as Polonius, and his son Laertes,</p>

<p>Hamlet, with others, among them Voltemand and</p>

<p>Cornelius.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death</p>

<p>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</p>

<p>To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom</p>

<p>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</p>

<p>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</p>

<p>That we with wisest sorrow think on him</p>

<p>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</p>

<p>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</p>

<p>Th’ imperial jointress to this warlike state,</p>

<p>Have we (as ’twere with a defeated joy,</p>

<p>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</p>

<p>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</p>

<p>In equal scale weighing delight and dole)</p>

<p>Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barred</p>

<p>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</p>

<p>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</p>

<p>Now follows that you know. Young Fortinbras,</p>

<p>Holding a weak supposal of our worth</p>

<p>Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death</p>

<p>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</p>

<p>Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,</p>

<p>He hath not failed to pester us with message</p>

<p>Importing the surrender of those lands</p>

<p>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</p>

<p>To our most valiant brother–so much for him.</p>

<p>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.</p>

<p>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</p>

<p>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,</p>

<p>Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears</p>

<p>Of this his nephew’s purpose, to suppress</p>

<p>His further gait herein, in that the levies,</p>

<p>The lists, and full proportions are all made</p>

<p>Out of his subject; and we here dispatch</p>

<p>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,</p>

<p>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,</p>

<p>Giving to you no further personal power</p>

<p>To business with the King more than the scope</p>

<p>Of these dilated articles allow.</p>

<p><center><i>[Giving them a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornelius</sc>/<sc>Voltemand</sc></p>

<p>In that and all things will we show our duty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[Voltemand and Cornelius exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?</p>

<p>You told us of some suit. What is ’t, Laertes?</p>

<p>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane</p>

<p>And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg,</p>

<p>Laertes,</p>

<p>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</p>

<p>The head is not more native to the heart,</p>

<p>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</p>

<p>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.</p>

<p>What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  My dread lord,</p>

<p>Your leave and favor to return to France,</p>

<p>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark</p>

<p>To show my duty in your coronation,</p>

<p>Yet now I must confess, that duty done,</p>

<p>My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France</p>

<p>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Polonius</sc></p>

<p>Hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave</p>

<p>By laborsome petition, and at last</p>

<p>Upon his will I sealed my hard consent.</p>

<p>I do beseech you give him leave to go.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,</p>

<p>And thy best graces spend it at thy will.–</p>

<p>But now, my cousin Hamlet and my son–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>A little more than kin and less than kind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Not so, my lord; I am too much in the sun.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,</p>

<p>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.</p>

<p>Do not forever with thy vailed lids</p>

<p>Seek for thy noble father in the dust.</p>

<p>Thou know’st ’tis common; all that lives must die,</p>

<p>Passing through nature to eternity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Ay, madam, it is common.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  If it be,</p>

<p>Why seems it so particular with thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>“Seems,” madam? Nay, it is. I know not “seems.”</p>

<p>’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</p>

<p>Nor customary suits of solemn black,</p>

<p>Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,</p>

<p>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</p>

<p>Nor the dejected havior of the visage,</p>

<p>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,</p>

<p>That can denote me truly. These indeed “seem,”</p>

<p>For they are actions that a man might play;</p>

<p>But I have that within which passes show,</p>

<p>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature,</p>

<p>Hamlet,</p>

<p>To give these mourning duties to your father.</p>

<p>But you must know your father lost a father,</p>

<p>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</p>

<p>In filial obligation for some term</p>

<p>To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever</p>

<p>In obstinate condolement is a course</p>

<p>Of impious stubbornness. ’Tis unmanly grief.</p>

<p>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</p>

<p>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</p>

<p>An understanding simple and unschooled.</p>

<p>For what we know must be and is as common</p>

<p>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</p>

<p>Why should we in our peevish opposition</p>

<p>Take it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven,</p>

<p>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</p>

<p>To reason most absurd, whose common theme</p>

<p>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</p>

<p>From the first corse till he that died today,</p>

<p>“This must be so.” We pray you, throw to earth</p>

<p>This unprevailing woe and think of us</p>

<p>As of a father; for let the world take note,</p>

<p>You are the most immediate to our throne,</p>

<p>And with no less nobility of love</p>

<p>Than that which dearest father bears his son</p>

<p>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</p>

<p>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</p>

<p>It is most retrograde to our desire,</p>

<p>And we beseech you, bend you to remain</p>

<p>Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</p>

<p>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.</p>

<p>I pray thee, stay with us. Go not to Wittenberg.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.</p>

<p>Be as ourself in Denmark.–Madam, come.</p>

<p>This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet</p>

<p>Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof</p>

<p>No jocund health that Denmark drinks today</p>

<p>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,</p>

<p>And the King’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,</p>

<p>Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. All but Hamlet exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>O, that this too, too sullied flesh would melt,</p>

<p>Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew,</p>

<p>Or that the Everlasting had not fixed</p>

<p>His canon ’gainst self-slaughter! O God, God,</p>

<p>How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable</p>

<p>Seem to me all the uses of this world!</p>

<p>Fie on ’t, ah fie! ’Tis an unweeded garden</p>

<p>That grows to seed. Things rank and gross in nature</p>

<p>Possess it merely. That it should come to this:</p>

<p>But two months dead–nay, not so much, not two.</p>

<p>So excellent a king, that was to this</p>

<p>Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother</p>

<p>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven</p>

<p>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and Earth,</p>

<p>Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him</p>

<p>As if increase of appetite had grown</p>

<p>By what it fed on. And yet, within a month</p>

<p>(Let me not think on ’t; frailty, thy name is woman!),</p>

<p>A little month, or ere those shoes were old</p>

<p>With which she followed my poor father’s body,</p>

<p>Like Niobe, all tears–why she, even she</p>

<p>(O God, a beast that wants discourse of reason</p>

<p>Would have mourned longer!), married with my</p>

<p>uncle,</p>

<p>My father’s brother, but no more like my father</p>

<p>Than I to Hercules. Within a month,</p>

<p>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears</p>

<p>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,</p>

<p>She married. O, most wicked speed, to post</p>

<p>With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!</p>

<p>It is not, nor it cannot come to good.</p>

<p>But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  Hail to your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I am glad to see you well.</p>

<p>Horatio–or I do forget myself!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Sir, my good friend. I’ll change that name with you.</p>

<p>And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?–</p>

<p>Marcellus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc>  My good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>I am very glad to see you. <i>[To Barnardo.]</i> Good</p>

<p>even, sir.–</p>

<p>But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>A truant disposition, good my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>I would not hear your enemy say so,</p>

<p>Nor shall you do my ear that violence</p>

<p>To make it truster of your own report</p>

<p>Against yourself. I know you are no truant.</p>

<p>But what is your affair in Elsinore?</p>

<p>We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>I prithee, do not mock me, fellow student.</p>

<p>I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Thrift, thrift, Horatio. The funeral baked meats</p>

<p>Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.</p>

<p>Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven</p>

<p>Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!</p>

<p>My father–methinks I see my father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Where, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  In my mind’s eye, Horatio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>I saw him once. He was a goodly king.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>He was a man. Take him for all in all,</p>

<p>I shall not look upon his like again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Saw who?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>My lord, the King your father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  The King my father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Season your admiration for a while</p>

<p>With an attent ear, till I may deliver</p>

<p>Upon the witness of these gentlemen</p>

<p>This marvel to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  For God’s love, let me hear!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Two nights together had these gentlemen,</p>

<p>Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch,</p>

<p>In the dead waste and middle of the night,</p>

<p>Been thus encountered: a figure like your father,</p>

<p>Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pie,</p>

<p>Appears before them and with solemn march</p>

<p>Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walked</p>

<p>By their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes</p>

<p>Within his truncheon’s length, whilst they, distilled</p>

<p>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</p>

<p>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me</p>

<p>In dreadful secrecy impart they did,</p>

<p>And I with them the third night kept the watch,</p>

<p>Where, as they had delivered, both in time,</p>

<p>Form of the thing (each word made true and good),</p>

<p>The apparition comes. I knew your father;</p>

<p>These hands are not more like.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  But where was this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Marcellus</sc></p>

<p>My lord, upon the platform where we watch.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Did you not speak to it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  My lord, I did,</p>

<p>But answer made it none. Yet once methought</p>

<p>It lifted up its head and did address</p>

<p>Itself to motion, like as it would speak;</p>

<p>But even then the morning cock crew loud,</p>

<p>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away</p>

<p>And vanished from our sight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  ’Tis very strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>As I do live, my honored lord, ’tis true.</p>

<p>And we did think it writ down in our duty</p>

<p>To let you know of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.</p>

<p>Hold you the watch tonight?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  We do, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Armed, say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Armed, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  From top to toe?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  My lord, from head to foot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Then saw you not his face?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>O, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  What, looked he frowningly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Pale or red?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Nay, very pale.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  And fixed his eyes upon you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Most constantly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I would I had been there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  It would have much amazed you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  Very like. Stayed it long?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>While one with moderate haste might tell a</p>

<p>hundred.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Barnardo</sc>/<sc>Marcellus</sc>  Longer, longer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>Not when I saw ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  His beard was grizzled, no?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc></p>

<p>It was as I have seen it in his life,</p>

<p>A sable silvered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc>  I will watch tonight.</p>

<p>Perchance ’twill walk again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Horatio</sc>  I warrant it will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>If it assume my noble father’s person,</p>

<p>I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape</p>

<p>And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,</p>

<p>If you have hitherto concealed this sight,</p>

<p>Let it be tenable in your silence still;</p>

<p>And whatsomever else shall hap tonight,</p>

<p>Give it an understanding but no tongue.</p>

<p>I will requite your loves. So fare you well.</p>

<p>Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve,</p>

<p>I’ll visit you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  Our duty to your Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Hamlet</sc></p>

<p>Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Hamlet exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>My father’s spirit–in arms! All is not well.</p>

<p>I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!</p>

<p>Till then, sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,</p>

<p>Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s</p>

<p>eyes.</p>
