<p><center><i>[Enter King and Laertes.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,</p>

<p>And you must put me in your heart for friend,</p>

<p>Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,</p>

<p>That he which hath your noble father slain</p>

<p>Pursued my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  It well appears. But tell me</p>

<p>Why you proceeded not against these feats,</p>

<p>So criminal and so capital in nature,</p>

<p>As by your safety, greatness, wisdom, all things else,</p>

<p>You mainly were stirred up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  O, for two special reasons,</p>

<p>Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed,</p>

<p>But yet to me they’re strong. The Queen his mother</p>

<p>Lives almost by his looks, and for myself</p>

<p>(My virtue or my plague, be it either which),</p>

<p>She is so conjunctive to my life and soul</p>

<p>That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,</p>

<p>I could not but by her. The other motive</p>

<p>Why to a public count I might not go</p>

<p>Is the great love the general gender bear him,</p>

<p>Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,</p>

<p>Work like the spring that turneth wood to stone,</p>

<p>Convert his gyves to graces, so that my arrows,</p>

<p>Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind,</p>

<p>Would have reverted to my bow again,</p>

<p>But not where I have aimed them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>And so have I a noble father lost,</p>

<p>A sister driven into desp’rate terms,</p>

<p>Whose worth, if praises may go back again,</p>

<p>Stood challenger on mount of all the age</p>

<p>For her perfections. But my revenge will come.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think</p>

<p>That we are made of stuff so flat and dull</p>

<p>That we can let our beard be shook with danger</p>

<p>And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.</p>

<p>I loved your father, and we love ourself,</p>

<p>And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger with letters.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now? What news?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  Letters, my lord, from</p>

<p>Hamlet.</p>

<p>These to your Majesty, this to the Queen.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  From Hamlet? Who brought them?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Sailors, my lord, they say. I saw them not.</p>

<p>They were given me by Claudio. He received them</p>

<p>Of him that brought them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Laertes, you shall hear</p>

<p>them.–</p>

<p>Leave us.     <i><i>[Messenger exits.]</i></i></p>

<p><i>[Reads.]</i> High and mighty, you shall know I am set</p>

<p>naked on your kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to</p>

<p>see your kingly eyes, when I shall (first asking your</p>

<p>pardon) thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden</p>

<p>and more strange return. Hamlet.</p>

<p>What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?</p>

<p>Or is it some abuse and no such thing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  Know you the hand?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  ’Tis Hamlet’s character. “Naked”–</p>

<p>And in a postscript here, he says “alone.”</p>

<p>Can you advise me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come.</p>

<p>It warms the very sickness in my heart</p>

<p>That I shall live and tell him to his teeth</p>

<p>“Thus didst thou.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  If it be so, Laertes</p>

<p>(As how should it be so? how otherwise?),</p>

<p>Will you be ruled by me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  Ay, my lord,</p>

<p>So you will not o’errule me to a peace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>To thine own peace. If he be now returned,</p>

<p>As checking at his voyage, and that he means</p>

<p>No more to undertake it, I will work him</p>

<p>To an exploit, now ripe in my device,</p>

<p>Under the which he shall not choose but fall;</p>

<p>And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,</p>

<p>But even his mother shall uncharge the practice</p>

<p>And call it accident.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  My lord, I will be ruled,</p>

<p>The rather if you could devise it so</p>

<p>That I might be the organ.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  It falls right.</p>

<p>You have been talked of since your travel much,</p>

<p>And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality</p>

<p>Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts</p>

<p>Did not together pluck such envy from him</p>

<p>As did that one, and that, in my regard,</p>

<p>Of the unworthiest siege.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  What part is that, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>A very ribbon in the cap of youth–</p>

<p>Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes</p>

<p>The light and careless livery that it wears</p>

<p>Than settled age his sables and his weeds,</p>

<p>Importing health and graveness. Two months since</p>

<p>Here was a gentleman of Normandy.</p>

<p>I have seen myself, and served against, the French,</p>

<p>And they can well on horseback, but this gallant</p>

<p>Had witchcraft in ’t. He grew unto his seat,</p>

<p>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse</p>

<p>As had he been encorpsed and demi-natured</p>

<p>With the brave beast. So far he topped my thought</p>

<p>That I in forgery of shapes and tricks</p>

<p>Come short of what he did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  A Norman was ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  A Norman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>Upon my life, Lamord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  The very same.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>I know him well. He is the brooch indeed</p>

<p>And gem of all the nation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  He made confession of you</p>

<p>And gave you such a masterly report</p>

<p>For art and exercise in your defense,</p>

<p>And for your rapier most especial,</p>

<p>That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed</p>

<p>If one could match you. The ’scrimers of their</p>

<p>nation</p>

<p>He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,</p>

<p>If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his</p>

<p>Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy</p>

<p>That he could nothing do but wish and beg</p>

<p>Your sudden coming-o’er, to play with you.</p>

<p>Now out of this–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  What out of this, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Laertes, was your father dear to you?</p>

<p>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</p>

<p>A face without a heart?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  Why ask you this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>Not that I think you did not love your father,</p>

<p>But that I know love is begun by time</p>

<p>And that I see, in passages of proof,</p>

<p>Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.</p>

<p>There lives within the very flame of love</p>

<p>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it,</p>

<p>And nothing is at a like goodness still;</p>

<p>For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,</p>

<p>Dies in his own too-much. That we would do</p>

<p>We should do when we would; for this “would”</p>

<p>changes</p>

<p>And hath abatements and delays as many</p>

<p>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;</p>

<p>And then this “should” is like a spendthrift sigh,</p>

<p>That hurts by easing. But to the quick of th’ ulcer:</p>

<p>Hamlet comes back; what would you undertake</p>

<p>To show yourself indeed your father’s son</p>

<p>More than in words?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  To cut his throat i’ th’ church.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc></p>

<p>No place indeed should murder sanctuarize;</p>

<p>Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,</p>

<p>Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.</p>

<p>Hamlet, returned, shall know you are come home.</p>

<p>We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence</p>

<p>And set a double varnish on the fame</p>

<p>The Frenchman gave you; bring you, in fine,</p>

<p>together</p>

<p>And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,</p>

<p>Most generous, and free from all contriving,</p>

<p>Will not peruse the foils, so that with ease,</p>

<p>Or with a little shuffling, you may choose</p>

<p>A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice</p>

<p>Requite him for your father.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  I will do ’t,</p>

<p>And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.</p>

<p>I bought an unction of a mountebank</p>

<p>So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,</p>

<p>Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,</p>

<p>Collected from all simples that have virtue</p>

<p>Under the moon, can save the thing from death</p>

<p>That is but scratched withal. I’ll touch my point</p>

<p>With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,</p>

<p>It may be death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Let’s further think of this,</p>

<p>Weigh what convenience both of time and means</p>

<p>May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,</p>

<p>And that our drift look through our bad</p>

<p>performance,</p>

<p>’Twere better not assayed. Therefore this project</p>

<p>Should have a back or second that might hold</p>

<p>If this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.</p>

<p>We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings–</p>

<p>I ha ’t!</p>

<p>When in your motion you are hot and dry</p>

<p>(As make your bouts more violent to that end)</p>

<p>And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepared</p>

<p>him</p>

<p>A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,</p>

<p>If he by chance escape your venomed stuck,</p>

<p>Our purpose may hold there.–But stay, what</p>

<p>noise?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Queen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>One woe doth tread upon another’s heel,</p>

<p>So fast they follow. Your sister’s drowned, Laertes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  Drowned? O, where?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc></p>

<p>There is a willow grows askant the brook</p>

<p>That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.</p>

<p>Therewith fantastic garlands did she make</p>

<p>Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,</p>

<p>That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,</p>

<p>But our cold maids do “dead men’s fingers” call</p>

<p>them.</p>

<p>There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds</p>

<p>Clamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,</p>

<p>When down her weedy trophies and herself</p>

<p>Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,</p>

<p>And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up,</p>

<p>Which time she chanted snatches of old lauds,</p>

<p>As one incapable of her own distress</p>

<p>Or like a creature native and endued</p>

<p>Unto that element. But long it could not be</p>

<p>Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,</p>

<p>Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay</p>

<p>To muddy death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc>  Alas, then she is drowned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Queen</sc>  Drowned, drowned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Laertes</sc></p>

<p>Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,</p>

<p>And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet</p>

<p>It is our trick; nature her custom holds,</p>

<p>Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,</p>

<p>The woman will be out.–Adieu, my lord.</p>

<p>I have a speech o’ fire that fain would blaze,</p>

<p>But that this folly drowns it.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>King</sc>  Let’s follow, Gertrude.</p>

<p>How much I had to do to calm his rage!</p>

<p>Now fear I this will give it start again.</p>

<p>Therefore, let’s follow.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
