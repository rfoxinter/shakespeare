<p><center><i>[Enter Othello with a light, and Desdemona in her bed.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.</p>

<p>Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars.</p>

<p>It is the cause. Yet I’ll not shed her blood,</p>

<p>Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,</p>

<p>And smooth as monumental alabaster.</p>

<p>Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.</p>

<p>Put out the light, and then put out the light.</p>

<p>If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,</p>

<p>I can again thy former light restore</p>

<p>Should I repent me. But once put out thy light,</p>

<p>Thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature,</p>

<p>I know not where is that Promethean heat</p>

<p>That can thy light relume. When I have plucked the</p>

<p>rose,</p>

<p>I cannot give it vital growth again.</p>

<p>It needs must wither. I’ll smell it on the tree.</p>

<p>O balmy breath, that dost almost persuade</p>

<p>Justice to break her sword! <i>[He kisses her.]</i> One</p>

<p>more, one more.</p>

<p>Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee</p>

<p>And love thee after. One more, and this the last.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kisses her.]</i></center></p>

<p>So sweet was ne’er so fatal. I must weep,</p>

<p>But they are cruel tears. This sorrow’s heavenly:</p>

<p>It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Who’s there? Othello?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Ay, Desdemona.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Will you come to bed, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Have you prayed tonight, Desdemon?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Ay, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>If you bethink yourself of any crime</p>

<p>Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,</p>

<p>Solicit for it straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Alack, my lord,</p>

<p>What may you mean by that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Well, do it, and be brief. I will walk by.</p>

<p>I would not kill thy unprepared spirit.</p>

<p>No, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Talk you of killing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Ay, I do.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Then heaven have mercy on me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Amen, with all my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Humh.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>And yet I fear you, for you’re fatal then</p>

<p>When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know</p>

<p>not,</p>

<p>Since guiltiness I know not, but yet I feel I fear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Think on thy sins.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  They are loves I bear to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Ay, and for that thou diest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>That death’s unnatural that kills for loving.</p>

<p>Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?</p>

<p>Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.</p>

<p>These are portents, but yet I hope, I hope</p>

<p>They do not point on me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Peace, and be still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>I will so. What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  That handkerchief</p>

<p>Which I so loved, and gave thee, thou gav’st to</p>

<p>Cassio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>No, by my life and soul! Send for the man</p>

<p>And ask him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Sweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury.</p>

<p>Thou art on thy deathbed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Ay, but not yet to die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Yes, presently.</p>

<p>Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin.</p>

<p>For to deny each article with oath</p>

<p>Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception</p>

<p>That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Then Lord have mercy on me!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I say “Amen.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>And have you mercy, too. I never did</p>

<p>Offend you in my life, never loved Cassio</p>

<p>But with such general warranty of heaven</p>

<p>As I might love. I never gave him token.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in ’s hand!</p>

<p>O perjured woman, thou dost stone my heart</p>

<p>And mak’st me call what I intend to do</p>

<p>A murder, which I thought a sacrifice!</p>

<p>I saw the handkerchief!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  He found it, then.</p>

<p>I never gave it him. Send for him hither.</p>

<p>Let him confess a truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  He hath confessed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  What, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>That he hath used thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  How? Unlawfully?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>He will not say so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  No. His mouth is stopped.</p>

<p>Honest Iago hath ta’en order for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>O, my fear interprets. What, is he dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge</p>

<p>Had stomach for them all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Alas, he is betrayed, and I undone.     <i><i>[She weeps.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Out, strumpet! Weep’st thou for him to my face?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>O banish me, my lord, but kill me not!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Down, strumpet!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Kill me tomorrow, let me live tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Nay, if you strive–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>But half an hour!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Being done, there is no pause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>But while I say one prayer!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  It is too late.</p>

<p><center><i>[He smothers her.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>My lord, my lord? What ho! My lord, my lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>What noise is this?–Not dead? Not yet quite dead?</p>

<p>I that am cruel am yet merciful.</p>

<p>I would not have thee linger in thy pain.</p>

<p>So, so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc> <i>[within]</i>  What, ho! My lord, my lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Who’s</p>

<p>there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Yes. ’Tis Emilia.–By and by.–She’s dead.</p>

<p>’Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death.</p>

<p>The noise was here. Ha, no more moving?</p>

<p>Still as the grave. Shall she come in? Were ’t good?</p>

<p>I think she stirs again. No. What’s best to do?</p>

<p>If she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife.</p>

<p>My wife, my wife! What wife? I have no wife.</p>

<p>O insupportable! O heavy hour!</p>

<p>Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse</p>

<p>Of sun and moon, and that th’ affrighted globe</p>

<p>Should yawn at alteration.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc> <i>[within]</i>  I do beseech you</p>

<p>That I may speak with you. O, good my lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>I had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.–</p>

<p>Soft, by and by, let me the curtains draw.–</p>

<p>Where art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Emilia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>What’s the matter with thee now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>O, my good lord, yonder’s foul murders done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  What? Now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  But now, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>It is the very error of the moon.</p>

<p>She comes more nearer Earth than she was wont</p>

<p>And makes men mad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Cassio, my lord, hath killed</p>

<p>A young Venetian called Roderigo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Roderigo killed? And Cassio killed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  No, Cassio is not killed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Not Cassio killed? Then murder’s out of tune,</p>

<p>And sweet revenge grows harsh.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  O falsely, falsely murdered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>O Lord, what cry is that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  That? What?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Out, and alas, that was my lady’s voice!</p>

<p>Help! Help ho! Help! O lady, speak again!</p>

<p>Sweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  A guiltless death I die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  O, who hath done this deed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Nobody. I myself. Farewell.</p>

<p>Commend me to my kind lord. O, farewell.</p>

<p><center><i>[She dies.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Why, how should she be murdered?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Alas, who</p>

<p>knows?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>You heard her say herself, it was not I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>She said so. I must needs report the truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>She’s like a liar gone to burning hell!</p>

<p>’Twas I that killed her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>O, the more angel she, and you the blacker devil!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>She turned to folly, and she was a whore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  She was false as water.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Thou art rash as fire to say</p>

<p>That she was false. O, she was heavenly true!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Cassio did top her. Ask thy husband else.</p>

<p>O, I were damned beneath all depth in hell</p>

<p>But that I did proceed upon just grounds</p>

<p>To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  My husband?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Thy husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  That she was false to wedlock?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Ay, with Cassio. Had she been true,</p>

<p>If heaven would make me such another world</p>

<p>Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,</p>

<p>I’d not have sold her for it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  My husband?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Ay, ’twas he that told me on her first.</p>

<p>An honest man he is, and hates the slime</p>

<p>That sticks on filthy deeds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  My husband?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>What needs this iterance, woman? I say, thy</p>

<p>husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!–</p>

<p>My husband say she was false?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  He, woman.</p>

<p>I say thy husband. Dost understand the word?</p>

<p>My friend, thy husband; honest, honest Iago.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>If he say so, may his pernicious soul</p>

<p>Rot half a grain a day! He lies to th’ heart!</p>

<p>She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.</p>

<p><center><i>[He draws his sword.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Hah?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Do thy worst!</p>

<p>This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven</p>

<p>Than thou wast worthy her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Peace, you were best!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Thou hast not half that power to do me harm</p>

<p>As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt,</p>

<p>As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed–</p>

<p>I care not for thy sword. I’ll make thee known,</p>

<p>Though I lost twenty lives. Help! Help, ho! Help!</p>

<p>The Moor hath killed my mistress! Murder, murder!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Montano, Gratiano, and Iago.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montano</sc></p>

<p>What is the matter? How now, general?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>O, are you come, Iago? You have done well,</p>

<p>That men must lay their murders on your neck.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  What is the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc> <i>[to Iago]</i></p>

<p>Disprove this villain, if thou be’st a man.</p>

<p>He says thou told’st him that his wife was false.</p>

<p>I know thou didst not. Thou ’rt not such a villain.</p>

<p>Speak, for my heart is full.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>I told him what I thought, and told no more</p>

<p>Than what he found himself was apt and true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>But did you ever tell him she was false?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>You told a lie, an odious, damned lie!</p>

<p>Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!</p>

<p>She false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>With Cassio, mistress. Go to! Charm your tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>I will not charm my tongue. I am bound to speak.</p>

<p>My mistress here lies murdered in her bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  O heavens forfend!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc> <i>[to Iago]</i></p>

<p>And your reports have set the murder on!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Nay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  ’Tis a strange truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montano</sc></p>

<p>O monstrous act!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Villainy, villainy, villainy!</p>

<p>I think upon ’t, I think! I smell ’t! O villainy!</p>

<p>I thought so then. I’ll kill myself for grief!</p>

<p>O villainy! Villainy!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>What, are you mad? I charge you get you home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.</p>

<p>’Tis proper I obey him, but not now.</p>

<p>Perchance, Iago, I will ne’er go home.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>O, O, O!     <i><i>[Othello falls on the bed.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Nay, lay thee down, and roar!</p>

<p>For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent</p>

<p>That e’er did lift up eye.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc> <i>[standing]</i>  O, she was foul!–</p>

<p>I scarce did know you, uncle. There lies your niece,</p>

<p>Whose breath indeed these hands have newly</p>

<p>stopped.</p>

<p>I know this act shows horrible and grim.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>Poor Desdemon, I am glad thy father’s dead.</p>

<p>Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief</p>

<p>Shore his old thread in twain. Did he live now,</p>

<p>This sight would make him do a desperate turn,</p>

<p>Yea, curse his better angel from his side,</p>

<p>And fall to reprobance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>’Tis pitiful. But yet Iago knows</p>

<p>That she with Cassio hath the act of shame</p>

<p>A thousand times committed. Cassio confessed it,</p>

<p>And she did gratify his amorous works</p>

<p>With that recognizance and pledge of love</p>

<p>Which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand.</p>

<p>It was a handkerchief, an antique token</p>

<p>My father gave my mother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  O God! O heavenly God!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Zounds, hold your peace!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  ’Twill out, ’twill out. I peace?</p>

<p>No, I will speak as liberal as the north.</p>

<p>Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,</p>

<p>All, all, cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Be wise, and get you home.</p>

<p><center><i>[He draws his sword.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>I will not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  Fie, your sword upon a woman!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>O thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak’st</p>

<p>of</p>

<p>I found by fortune, and did give my husband–</p>

<p>For often, with a solemn earnestness</p>

<p>(More than indeed belonged to such a trifle),</p>

<p>He begged of me to steal ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Villainous whore!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>She give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,</p>

<p>And I did give ’t my husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Filth, thou liest!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen!</p>

<p><i>[To Othello.]</i> O murd’rous coxcomb, what should</p>

<p>such a fool</p>

<p>Do with so good a wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Are there no stones in heaven</p>

<p>But what serves for the thunder?–Precious villain!</p>

<p><center><i>[The Moor runs at Iago but is disarmed.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Iago kills his wife.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>The woman falls! Sure he hath killed his wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress’ side.     <i><i>[Iago exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  He’s gone, but his wife’s killed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montano</sc></p>

<p>’Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon</p>

<p>Which I have here recovered from the Moor.</p>

<p>Come, guard the door without. Let him not pass,</p>

<p>But kill him rather. I’ll after that same villain,</p>

<p>For ’tis a damned slave.</p>

<p><center><i>[Montano and Gratiano exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I am not valiant neither,</p>

<p>But every puny whipster gets my sword.</p>

<p>But why should honor outlive honesty?</p>

<p>Let it go all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  What did thy song bode, lady?</p>

<p>Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan</p>

<p>And die in music.</p>

<p><i>[She sings.]</i>     <i>Willow, willow, willow.</i></p>

<p>Moor, she was chaste. She loved thee, cruel Moor.</p>

<p>So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true.</p>

<p>So speaking as I think, alas, I die.      <i><i>[She dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>I have another weapon in this chamber.</p>

<p>It is a sword of Spain, the ice brook’s temper.</p>

<p>O, here it is.–Uncle, I must come forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc> <i>[within]</i></p>

<p>If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear;</p>

<p>Thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Look in upon me, then, and speak with me,</p>

<p>Or naked as I am I will assault thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gratiano.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc></p>

<p>What is the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Behold, I have a weapon.</p>

<p>A better never did itself sustain</p>

<p>Upon a soldier’s thigh. I have seen the day</p>

<p>That with this little arm and this good sword</p>

<p>I have made my way through more impediments</p>

<p>Than twenty times your stop. But–O vain boast!–</p>

<p>Who can control his fate? ’Tis not so now.</p>

<p>Be not afraid, though you do see me weaponed.</p>

<p>Here is my journey’s end, here is my butt</p>

<p>And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.</p>

<p>Do you go back dismayed? ’Tis a lost fear.</p>

<p>Man but a rush against Othello’s breast,</p>

<p>And he retires. Where should Othello go?</p>

<p><center><i>[He looks toward the bed.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starred wench,</p>

<p>Pale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt,</p>

<p>This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,</p>

<p>And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?</p>

<p>Even like thy chastity.–O cursed, cursed slave!–</p>

<p>Whip me, you devils,</p>

<p>From the possession of this heavenly sight!</p>

<p>Blow me about in winds, roast me in sulfur,</p>

<p>Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!</p>

<p>O Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! Dead! O, O!</p>

<br/>

<p> <i>[Enter Lodovico, Cassio in a chair, Montano, and Iago,</p>

<p>with Officers.]</i></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>That’s he that was Othello. Here I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.</p>

<p><center><i>[Iago is brought forward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>I look down towards his feet; but that’s a fable.–</p>

<p>If that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee.</p>

<p><center><i>[He stabs Iago.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>Wrench his sword from him.</p>

<p><center><i>[Othello is disarmed.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I bleed, sir, but not killed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>I am not sorry neither. I’d have thee live,</p>

<p>For in my sense ’tis happiness to die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>O thou Othello, that wert once so good,</p>

<p>Fall’n in the practice of a damned slave,</p>

<p>What shall be said to thee?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Why, anything.</p>

<p>An honorable murderer, if you will,</p>

<p>For naught I did in hate, but all in honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>This wretch hath part confessed his villainy.</p>

<p>Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>Dear general, I never gave you cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.</p>

<p>Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil</p>

<p>Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Demand me nothing. What you know, you know.</p>

<p>From this time forth I never will speak word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc>  What? Not to pray?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  Torments will ope your lips.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Well, thou dost best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc>  Sir,</p>

<p>You shall understand what hath befall’n,</p>

<p>Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter</p>

<p>Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,</p>

<p>And here another. <i>[He shows papers.]</i> The one of</p>

<p>them imports</p>

<p>The death of Cassio, to be undertook</p>

<p>By Roderigo.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>O villain!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Most heathenish and most gross.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>Now here’s another discontented paper</p>

<p>Found in his pocket, too; and this it seems</p>

<p>Roderigo meant t’ have sent this damned villain,</p>

<p>But that, belike, Iago in the interim</p>

<p>Came in and satisfied him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  O, thou pernicious caitiff!–</p>

<p>How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief</p>

<p>That was my wife’s?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  I found it in my chamber.</p>

<p>And he himself confessed it but even now,</p>

<p>That there he dropped it for a special purpose</p>

<p>Which wrought to his desire.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  O fool, fool, fool!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>There is besides, in Roderigo’s letter,</p>

<p>How he upbraids Iago, that he made him</p>

<p>Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came</p>

<p>That I was cast. And even but now he spake,</p>

<p>After long seeming dead: Iago hurt him,</p>

<p>Iago set him on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc> <i>[to Othello]</i></p>

<p>You must forsake this room and go with us.</p>

<p>Your power and your command is taken off,</p>

<p>And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,</p>

<p>If there be any cunning cruelty</p>

<p>That can torment him much and hold him long,</p>

<p>It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,</p>

<p>Till that the nature of your fault be known</p>

<p>To the Venetian state.–Come, bring away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Soft you. A word or two before you go.</p>

<p>I have done the state some service, and they</p>

<p>know ’t.</p>

<p>No more of that. I pray you in your letters,</p>

<p>When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,</p>

<p>Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,</p>

<p>Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak</p>

<p>Of one that loved not wisely, but too well;</p>

<p>Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought,</p>

<p>Perplexed in the extreme; of one whose hand,</p>

<p>Like the base Judean, threw a pearl away</p>

<p>Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued</p>

<p>eyes,</p>

<p>Albeit unused to the melting mood,</p>

<p>Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees</p>

<p>Their medicinable gum. Set you down this.</p>

<p>And say besides, that in Aleppo once,</p>

<p>Where a malignant and a turbanned Turk</p>

<p>Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,</p>

<p>I took by th’ throat the circumcised dog,</p>

<p>And smote him, thus.     <i><i>[He stabs himself.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc>  O bloody period!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gratiano</sc>  All that is spoke is marred.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc> <i>[to Desdemona]</i></p>

<p>I kissed thee ere I killed thee. No way but this,</p>

<p>Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.     <i><i>[He dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,</p>

<p>For he was great of heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc> <i>[to Iago]</i>  O Spartan dog,</p>

<p>More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea,</p>

<p>Look on the tragic loading of this bed.</p>

<p>This is thy work.–The object poisons sight.</p>

<p>Let it be hid.–Gratiano, keep the house,</p>

<p>And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,</p>

<p>For they succeed on you. <i>[To Cassio.]</i> To you, lord</p>

<p>governor,</p>

<p>Remains the censure of this hellish villain.</p>

<p>The time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it.</p>

<p>Myself will straight aboard, and to the state</p>

<p>This heavy act with heavy heart relate.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
