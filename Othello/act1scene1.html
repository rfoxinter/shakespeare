<p><center><i>[Enter Roderigo and Iago.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly</p>

<p>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</p>

<p>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  ’Sblood, but you’ll not hear me!</p>

<p>If ever I did dream of such a matter,</p>

<p>Abhor me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>Thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Despise me</p>

<p>If I do not. Three great ones of the city,</p>

<p>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</p>

<p>Off-capped to him; and, by the faith of man,</p>

<p>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.</p>

<p>But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,</p>

<p>Evades them with a bombast circumstance,</p>

<p>Horribly stuffed with epithets of war,</p>

<p>And in conclusion,</p>

<p>Nonsuits my mediators. For “Certes,” says he,</p>

<p>“I have already chose my officer.”</p>

<p>And what was he?</p>

<p>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</p>

<p>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</p>

<p>A fellow almost damned in a fair wife,</p>

<p>That never set a squadron in the field,</p>

<p>Nor the division of a battle knows</p>

<p>More than a spinster–unless the bookish theoric,</p>

<p>Wherein the toged consuls can propose</p>

<p>As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice</p>

<p>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th’ election;</p>

<p>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</p>

<p>At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds</p>

<p>Christened and heathen, must be beleed and</p>

<p>calmed</p>

<p>By debitor and creditor. This countercaster,</p>

<p>He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</p>

<p>And I, God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>Why, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service.</p>

<p>Preferment goes by letter and affection,</p>

<p>And not by old gradation, where each second</p>

<p>Stood heir to th’ first. Now, sir, be judge yourself</p>

<p>Whether I in any just term am affined</p>

<p>To love the Moor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>I would not follow him, then.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  O, sir, content you.</p>

<p>I follow him to serve my turn upon him.</p>

<p>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</p>

<p>Cannot be truly followed. You shall mark</p>

<p>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave</p>

<p>That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</p>

<p>Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,</p>

<p>For naught but provender, and when he’s old,</p>

<p>cashiered.</p>

<p>Whip me such honest knaves! Others there are</p>

<p>Who, trimmed in forms and visages of duty,</p>

<p>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</p>

<p>And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</p>

<p>Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined</p>

<p>their coats,</p>

<p>Do themselves homage. These fellows have some</p>

<p>soul,</p>

<p>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</p>

<p>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</p>

<p>Were I the Moor I would not be Iago.</p>

<p>In following him, I follow but myself.</p>

<p>Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</p>

<p>But seeming so for my peculiar end.</p>

<p>For when my outward action doth demonstrate</p>

<p>The native act and figure of my heart</p>

<p>In complement extern, ’tis not long after</p>

<p>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</p>

<p>For daws to peck at. I am not what I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe</p>

<p>If he can carry ’t thus!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Call up her father.</p>

<p>Rouse him. Make after him, poison his delight,</p>

<p>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</p>

<p>And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</p>

<p>Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,</p>

<p>Yet throw such chances of vexation on ’t</p>

<p>As it may lose some color.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>Here is her father’s house. I’ll call aloud.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</p>

<p>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</p>

<p>Is spied in populous cities.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>What ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>Awake! What ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!</p>

<p>Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!</p>

<p>Thieves, thieves!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Brabantio, above.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span></p>

<p>What is the reason of this terrible summons?</p>

<p>What is the matter there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>Signior, is all your family within?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>Are your doors locked?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span>  Why, wherefore ask you this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>Zounds, sir, you’re robbed. For shame, put on your</p>

<p>gown!</p>

<p>Your heart is burst. You have lost half your soul.</p>

<p>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</p>

<p>Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!</p>

<p>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</p>

<p>Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.</p>

<p>Arise, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span>  What, have you lost your wits?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span>  Not I. What are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>My name is Roderigo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span>  The worser welcome.</p>

<p>I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.</p>

<p>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</p>

<p>My daughter is not for thee. And now in madness,</p>

<p>Being full of supper and distemp’ring draughts,</p>

<p>Upon malicious bravery dost thou come</p>

<p>To start my quiet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span>  Sir, sir, sir–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span>  But thou must needs be sure</p>

<p>My spirit and my place have in them power</p>

<p>To make this bitter to thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>Patience, good sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span>  What tell’st thou me of robbing?</p>

<p>This is Venice. My house is not a grange.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span>  Most grave Brabantio,</p>

<p>In simple and pure soul I come to you–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not</p>

<p>serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to</p>

<p>do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll</p>

<p>have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse,</p>

<p>you’ll have your nephews neigh to you, you’ll have</p>

<p>coursers for cousins and jennets for germans.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span>  What profane wretch art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter</p>

<p>and the Moor are now making the beast with</p>

<p>two backs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span>  Thou art a villain.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  You are a senator.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span></p>

<p>This thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,</p>

<p>If ’t be your pleasure and most wise consent–</p>

<p>As partly I find it is–that your fair daughter,</p>

<p>At this odd-even and dull watch o’ th’ night,</p>

<p>Transported with no worse nor better guard</p>

<p>But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</p>

<p>To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:</p>

<p>If this be known to you, and your allowance,</p>

<p>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.</p>

<p>But if you know not this, my manners tell me</p>

<p>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</p>

<p>That from the sense of all civility</p>

<p>I thus would play and trifle with your Reverence.</p>

<p>Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</p>

<p>I say again, hath made a gross revolt,</p>

<p>Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes</p>

<p>In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</p>

<p>Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself.</p>

<p>If she be in her chamber or your house,</p>

<p>Let loose on me the justice of the state</p>

<p>For thus deluding you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span>  Strike on the tinder, ho!</p>

<p>Give me a taper. Call up all my people.</p>

<p>This accident is not unlike my dream.</p>

<p>Belief of it oppresses me already.</p>

<p>Light, I say, light!     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span> <i>[to Roderigo]</i>  Farewell, for I must leave you.</p>

<p>It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place</p>

<p>To be producted, as if I stay I shall,</p>

<p>Against the Moor. For I do know the state,</p>

<p>However this may gall him with some check,</p>

<p>Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embarked</p>

<p>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,</p>

<p>Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls,</p>

<p>Another of his fathom they have none</p>

<p>To lead their business. In which regard,</p>

<p>Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,</p>

<p>Yet, for necessity of present life,</p>

<p>I must show out a flag and sign of love–</p>

<p>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find</p>

<p>him,</p>

<p>Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,</p>

<p>And there will I be with him. So, farewell.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Brabantio in his nightgown, with Servants and</p>

<p>Torches.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span></p>

<p>It is too true an evil. Gone she is,</p>

<p>And what’s to come of my despised time</p>

<p>Is naught but bitterness.–Now, Roderigo,</p>

<p>Where didst thou see her?–O, unhappy girl!–</p>

<p>With the Moor, sayst thou?–Who would be a</p>

<p>father?–</p>

<p>How didst thou know ’twas she?–O, she deceives</p>

<p>me</p>

<p>Past thought!–What said she to you?–Get more</p>

<p>tapers.</p>

<p>Raise all my kindred.–Are they married, think</p>

<p>you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span>  Truly, I think they are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span></p>

<p>O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!</p>

<p>Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters’ minds</p>

<p>By what you see them act.–Is there not charms</p>

<p>By which the property of youth and maidhood</p>

<p>May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,</p>

<p>Of some such thing?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span>  Yes, sir, I have indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span></p>

<p>Call up my brother.–O, would you had had her!–</p>

<p>Some one way, some another.–Do you know</p>

<p>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>I think I can discover him, if you please</p>

<p>To get good guard and go along with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span></p>

<p>Pray you lead on. At every house I’ll call.</p>

<p>I may command at most.–Get weapons, ho!</p>

<p>And raise some special officers of night.–</p>

<p>On, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.</p>
