<p><center><i>[Enter Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, and</p>

<p>Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>O, pardon me, ’twill do me good to walk.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>Madam, good night. I humbly thank your Ladyship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Your Honor is most welcome.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Will you walk, sir?–O, Desdemona–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  My lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Get you to bed on th’ instant. I will be</p>

<p>returned forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there.</p>

<p>Look ’t be done.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  I will, my lord.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Desdemona and Emilia exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>He says he will return incontinent,</p>

<p>And hath commanded me to go to bed,</p>

<p>And bade me to dismiss you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Dismiss me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>It was his bidding. Therefore, good Emilia,</p>

<p>Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.</p>

<p>We must not now displease him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  I would you had never seen him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>So would not I. My love doth so approve him</p>

<p>That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns–</p>

<p>Prithee, unpin me–have grace and favor in them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>All’s one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!</p>

<p>If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me</p>

<p>In one of those same sheets.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Come, come, you talk!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>My mother had a maid called Barbary.</p>

<p>She was in love, and he she loved proved mad</p>

<p>And did forsake her. She had a song of willow,</p>

<p>An old thing ’twas, but it expressed her fortune,</p>

<p>And she died singing it. That song tonight</p>

<p>Will not go from my mind. I have much to do</p>

<p>But to go hang my head all at one side</p>

<p>And sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Shall I go fetch your nightgown?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  No, unpin me here.</p>

<p>This Lodovico is a proper man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  A very handsome man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  He speaks well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  I know a lady in Venice would have walked</p>

<p>barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc> <i>[singing]</i></p>

<p>     <i>The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Sing all a green willow.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Sing willow, willow, willow.</i></p>

<p>     <i>The fresh streams ran by her and murmured her</i></p>

<p>moans,</p>

<p>        <i>Sing willow, willow, willow;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Her salt tears fell from her, and softened the</i></p>

<p>stones–</p>

<p>Lay by these.</p>

<p>        <i>Sing willow, willow, willow.</i></p>

<p>Prithee hie thee! He’ll come anon.</p>

<p>     <i>Sing all a green willow must be my garland.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Let nobody blame him, his scorn I approve.</i></p>

<p>Nay, that’s not next. Hark, who is ’t that knocks?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  It’s the wind.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>     <i>I called my love false love, but what said he then?</i></p>

<p>        <i>Sing willow, willow, willow.</i></p>

<p>     <i>If I court more women, you’ll couch with more</i></p>

<p>men.–</p>

<p>So, get thee gone. Good night. Mine eyes do itch;</p>

<p>Doth that bode weeping?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  ’Tis neither here nor there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>I have heard it said so. O these men, these men!</p>

<p>Dost thou in conscience think–tell me, Emilia–</p>

<p>That there be women do abuse their husbands</p>

<p>In such gross kind?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  There be some such, no</p>

<p>question.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Why, would not you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  No, by this heavenly light!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Nor I neither, by this heavenly light.</p>

<p>I might do ’t as well i’ th’ dark.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  The world’s a huge thing. It is a great price</p>

<p>for a small vice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  In troth, I think thou wouldst not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  In troth, I think I should, and undo ’t when I</p>

<p>had done it. Marry, I would not do such a thing for</p>

<p>a joint ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for</p>

<p>gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition.</p>

<p>But for the whole world–’Uds pity! Who</p>

<p>would not make her husband a cuckold to make</p>

<p>him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong</p>

<p>for the whole world!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Why, the wrong is but a wrong i’ th’ world;</p>

<p>and, having the world for your labor, ’tis a wrong in</p>

<p>your own world, and you might quickly make it</p>

<p>right.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  I do not think there is any such woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Yes, a dozen; and as many to th’ vantage as</p>

<p>would store the world they played for.</p>

<p>But I do think it is their husbands’ faults</p>

<p>If wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties,</p>

<p>And pour our treasures into foreign laps;</p>

<p>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</p>

<p>Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,</p>

<p>Or scant our former having in despite.</p>

<p>Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,</p>

<p>Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</p>

<p>Their wives have sense like them. They see, and</p>

<p>smell,</p>

<p>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</p>

<p>As husbands have. What is it that they do</p>

<p>When they change us for others? Is it sport?</p>

<p>I think it is. And doth affection breed it?</p>

<p>I think it doth. Is ’t frailty that thus errs?</p>

<p>It is so too. And have not we affections,</p>

<p>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</p>

<p>Then let them use us well. Else let them know,</p>

<p>The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Good night, good night. God me such uses send,</p>

<p>Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend.</p>
