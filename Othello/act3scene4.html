<p><center><i>[Enter Desdemona, Emilia, and Clown.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant</p>

<p>Cassio lies?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clown</span>  I dare not say he lies anywhere.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  Why, man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clown</span>  He’s a soldier, and for me to say a soldier lies,</p>

<p>’tis stabbing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  Go to! Where lodges he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clown</span>  To tell you where he lodges is to tell you</p>

<p>where I lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  Can anything be made of this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clown</span>  I know not where he lodges; and for me to</p>

<p>devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies</p>

<p>there, were to lie in mine own throat.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  Can you inquire him out, and be edified</p>

<p>by report?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clown</span>  I will catechize the world for him–that is,</p>

<p>make questions, and by them answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I</p>

<p>have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will</p>

<p>be well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Clown</span>  To do this is within the compass of man’s wit,</p>

<p>and therefore I will attempt the doing it.</p>

<p><center><i>[Clown exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  I know not, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse</p>

<p>Full of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor</p>

<p>Is true of mind and made of no such baseness</p>

<p>As jealous creatures are, it were enough</p>

<p>To put him to ill thinking.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Is he not jealous?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>Who, he? I think the sun where he was born</p>

<p>Drew all such humors from him.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Look where he</p>

<p>comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Othello.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>I will not leave him now till Cassio</p>

<p>Be called to him.–How is ’t with you, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>Well, my good lady. <i>[Aside.]</i> O, hardness to</p>

<p>dissemble!–</p>

<p>How do you, Desdemona?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  Well, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>Give me your hand. <i>[He takes her hand.]</i> This hand</p>

<p>is moist, my lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.</p>

<p>Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires</p>

<p>A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,</p>

<p>Much castigation, exercise devout;</p>

<p>For here’s a young and sweating devil here</p>

<p>That commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,</p>

<p>A frank one.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  You may indeed say so,</p>

<p>For ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>A liberal hand! The hearts of old gave hands,</p>

<p>But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  What promise, chuck?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.</p>

<p>Lend me thy handkerchief.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  Here, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>That which I gave you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  I have it not about me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  No, faith, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  That’s a fault. That handkerchief</p>

<p>Did an Egyptian to my mother give.</p>

<p>She was a charmer, and could almost read</p>

<p>The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept</p>

<p>it,</p>

<p>’Twould make her amiable and subdue my father</p>

<p>Entirely to her love. But if she lost it,</p>

<p>Or made a gift of it, my father’s eye</p>

<p>Should hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt</p>

<p>After new fancies. She, dying, gave it me,</p>

<p>And bid me, when my fate would have me wived,</p>

<p>To give it her. I did so; and take heed on ’t,</p>

<p>Make it a darling like your precious eye.</p>

<p>To lose ’t or give ’t away were such perdition</p>

<p>As nothing else could match.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  Is ’t possible?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>’Tis true. There’s magic in the web of it.</p>

<p>A sybil that had numbered in the world</p>

<p>The sun to course two hundred compasses,</p>

<p>In her prophetic fury sewed the work.</p>

<p>The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk,</p>

<p>And it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful</p>

<p>Conserved of maidens’ hearts.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  I’ faith, is ’t true?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>Most veritable. Therefore, look to ’t well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>Then would to God that I had never seen ’t!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Ha? Wherefore?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>Why do you speak so startingly and rash?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>Is ’t lost? Is ’t gone? Speak, is ’t out o’ th’ way?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  Heaven bless us!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>It is not lost, but what an if it were?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  How?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  I say it is not lost.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Fetch ’t. Let me see ’t!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>Why, so I can. But I will not now.</p>

<p>This is a trick to put me from my suit.</p>

<p>Pray you, let Cassio be received again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>Fetch me the handkerchief! <i>[Aside.]</i> My mind</p>

<p>misgives.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  Come, come.</p>

<p>You’ll never meet a more sufficient man.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>The handkerchief!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  I pray, talk me of Cassio.</p>

<br/>

<p>OTHELLOThe handkerchief!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  A man that all his time</p>

<p>Hath founded his good fortunes on your love;</p>

<p>Shared dangers with you–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>The handkerchief!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  I’ faith, you are to blame.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Zounds!     <i><i>[Othello exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Is not this man jealous?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  I ne’er saw this before.</p>

<p>Sure, there’s some wonder in this handkerchief!</p>

<p>I am most unhappy in the loss of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span></p>

<p>’Tis not a year or two shows us a man.</p>

<p>They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;</p>

<p>They eat us hungerly, and when they are full</p>

<p>They belch us.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Iago and Cassio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look you–Cassio and my husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span> <i>[to Cassio]</i></p>

<p>There is no other way; ’tis she must do ’t,</p>

<p>And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>How now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span></p>

<p>Madam, my former suit. I do beseech you</p>

<p>That by your virtuous means I may again</p>

<p>Exist, and be a member of his love</p>

<p>Whom I with all the office of my heart</p>

<p>Entirely honor. I would not be delayed.</p>

<p>If my offense be of such mortal kind</p>

<p>That nor my service past nor present sorrows</p>

<p>Nor purposed merit in futurity</p>

<p>Can ransom me into his love again,</p>

<p>But to know so must be my benefit.</p>

<p>So shall I clothe me in a forced content,</p>

<p>And shut myself up in some other course</p>

<p>To fortune’s alms.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span>  Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,</p>

<p>My advocation is not now in tune.</p>

<p>My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him</p>

<p>Were he in favor as in humor altered.</p>

<p>So help me every spirit sanctified</p>

<p>As I have spoken for you all my best,</p>

<p>And stood within the blank of his displeasure</p>

<p>For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.</p>

<p>What I can do I will; and more I will</p>

<p>Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>Is my lord angry?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  He went hence but now,</p>

<p>And certainly in strange unquietness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon</p>

<p>When it hath blown his ranks into the air</p>

<p>And, like the devil, from his very arm</p>

<p>Puffed his own brother–and is he angry?</p>

<p>Something of moment then. I will go meet him.</p>

<p>There’s matter in ’t indeed if he be angry.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>I prithee do so.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Something, sure, of state,</p>

<p>Either from Venice, or some unhatched practice</p>

<p>Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,</p>

<p>Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases</p>

<p>Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things,</p>

<p>Though great ones are their object. ’Tis even so.</p>

<p>For let our finger ache, and it endues</p>

<p>Our other healthful members even to a sense</p>

<p>Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,</p>

<p>Nor of them look for such observancy</p>

<p>As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,</p>

<p>I was–unhandsome warrior as I am!–</p>

<p>Arraigning his unkindness with my soul.</p>

<p>But now I find I had suborned the witness,</p>

<p>And he’s indicted falsely.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Pray heaven it be</p>

<p>State matters, as you think, and no conception</p>

<p>Nor no jealous toy concerning you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>Alas the day, I never gave him cause!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span></p>

<p>But jealous souls will not be answered so.</p>

<p>They are not ever jealous for the cause,</p>

<p>But jealous for they’re jealous. It is a monster</p>

<p>Begot upon itself, born on itself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>Heaven keep that monster from Othello’s mind!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Emilia</span>  Lady, amen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>I will go seek him.–Cassio, walk hereabout.</p>

<p>If I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit</p>

<p>And seek to effect it to my uttermost.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  I humbly thank your Ladyship.</p>

<p><center><i>[Desdemona and Emilia exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bianca.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>’Save you, friend Cassio!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  What make you from</p>

<p>home?</p>

<p>How is ’t with you, my most fair Bianca?</p>

<p>I’ faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.</p>

<p>What, keep a week away? Seven days and nights,</p>

<p>Eightscore eight hours, and lovers’ absent hours</p>

<p>More tedious than the dial eightscore times?</p>

<p>O weary reck’ning!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Pardon me, Bianca.</p>

<p>I have this while with leaden thoughts been pressed,</p>

<p>But I shall in a more continuate time</p>

<p>Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,</p>

<p><center><i>[Giving her Desdemona’s handkerchief.]</i></center></p>

<p>Take me this work out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span>  O, Cassio, whence came this?</p>

<p>This is some token from a newer friend.</p>

<p>To the felt absence now I feel a cause.</p>

<p>Is ’t come to this? Well, well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Go to, woman!</p>

<p>Throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth,</p>

<p>From whence you have them. You are jealous now</p>

<p>That this is from some mistress, some</p>

<p>remembrance.</p>

<p>No, by my faith, Bianca.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span>  Why, whose is it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span></p>

<p>I know not neither. I found it in my chamber.</p>

<p>I like the work well. Ere it be demanded,</p>

<p>As like enough it will, I would have it copied.</p>

<p>Take it, and do ’t, and leave me for this time.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span>  Leave you? Wherefore?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span></p>

<p>I do attend here on the General,</p>

<p>And think it no addition, nor my wish,</p>

<p>To have him see me womaned.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span>  Why, I pray you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Not that I love you not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span>  But that you do not love me!</p>

<p>I pray you bring me on the way a little,</p>

<p>And say if I shall see you soon at night.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span></p>

<p>’Tis but a little way that I can bring you,</p>

<p>For I attend here. But I’ll see you soon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Bianca</span></p>

<p>’Tis very good. I must be circumstanced.</p>
