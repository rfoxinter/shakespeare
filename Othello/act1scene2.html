<p><center><i>[Enter Othello, Iago, Attendants, with Torches.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>Though in the trade of war I have slain men,</p>

<p>Yet do I hold it very stuff o’ th’ conscience</p>

<p>To do no contrived murder. I lack iniquity</p>

<p>Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times</p>

<p>I had thought t’ have yerked him here under the</p>

<p>ribs.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>’Tis better as it is.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Nay, but he prated</p>

<p>And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms</p>

<p>Against your Honor,</p>

<p>That with the little godliness I have</p>

<p>I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,</p>

<p>Are you fast married? Be assured of this,</p>

<p>That the magnifico is much beloved,</p>

<p>And hath in his effect a voice potential</p>

<p>As double as the Duke’s. He will divorce you</p>

<p>Or put upon you what restraint or grievance</p>

<p>The law (with all his might to enforce it on)</p>

<p>Will give him cable.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Let him do his spite.</p>

<p>My services which I have done the signiory</p>

<p>Shall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know</p>

<p>(Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,</p>

<p>I shall promulgate) I fetch my life and being</p>

<p>From men of royal siege, and my demerits</p>

<p>May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune</p>

<p>As this that I have reached. For know, Iago,</p>

<p>But that I love the gentle Desdemona,</p>

<p>I would not my unhoused free condition</p>

<p>Put into circumscription and confine</p>

<p>For the sea’s worth. But look, what lights come</p>

<p>yond?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>Those are the raised father and his friends.</p>

<p>You were best go in.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Not I. I must be found.</p>

<p>My parts, my title, and my perfect soul</p>

<p>Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  By Janus, I think no.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cassio, with Officers, and Torches.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant!</p>

<p>The goodness of the night upon you, friends.</p>

<p>What is the news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  The Duke does greet you, general,</p>

<p>And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,</p>

<p>Even on the instant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  What is the matter, think you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span></p>

<p>Something from Cyprus, as I may divine.</p>

<p>It is a business of some heat. The galleys</p>

<p>Have sent a dozen sequent messengers</p>

<p>This very night at one another’s heels,</p>

<p>And many of the Consuls, raised and met,</p>

<p>Are at the Duke’s already. You have been hotly</p>

<p>called for.</p>

<p>When, being not at your lodging to be found,</p>

<p>The Senate hath sent about three several quests</p>

<p>To search you out.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  ’Tis well I am found by you.</p>

<p>I will but spend a word here in the house</p>

<p>And go with you.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Ancient, what makes he here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack.</p>

<p>If it prove lawful prize, he’s made forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span></p>

<p>I do not understand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  He’s married.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  To who?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>Marry, to–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Reenter Othello.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Come, captain, will you go?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Have with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span></p>

<p>Here comes another troop to seek for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, with Officers, and Torches.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>It is Brabantio. General, be advised,</p>

<p>He comes to bad intent.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Holla, stand there!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span></p>

<p>Signior, it is the Moor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span>  Down with him,</p>

<p>thief!</p>

<p><center><i>[They draw their swords.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust</p>

<p>them.</p>

<p>Good signior, you shall more command with years</p>

<p>Than with your weapons.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span></p>

<p>O, thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my</p>

<p>daughter?</p>

<p>Damned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her!</p>

<p>For I’ll refer me to all things of sense,</p>

<p>If she in chains of magic were not bound,</p>

<p>Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,</p>

<p>So opposite to marriage that she shunned</p>

<p>The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,</p>

<p>Would ever have, t’ incur a general mock,</p>

<p>Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom</p>

<p>Of such a thing as thou–to fear, not to delight!</p>

<p>Judge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense</p>

<p>That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms,</p>

<p>Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals</p>

<p>That weakens motion. I’ll have ’t disputed on.</p>

<p>’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.</p>

<p>I therefore apprehend and do attach thee</p>

<p>For an abuser of the world, a practicer</p>

<p>Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.–</p>

<p>Lay hold upon him. If he do resist,</p>

<p>Subdue him at his peril.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Hold your hands,</p>

<p>Both you of my inclining and the rest.</p>

<p>Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it</p>

<p>Without a prompter.–Whither will you that I go</p>

<p>To answer this your charge?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span>  To prison, till fit time</p>

<p>Of law and course of direct session</p>

<p>Call thee to answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  What if I do obey?</p>

<p>How may the Duke be therewith satisfied,</p>

<p>Whose messengers are here about my side,</p>

<p>Upon some present business of the state,</p>

<p>To bring me to him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Officer</span>  ’Tis true, most worthy signior.</p>

<p>The Duke’s in council, and your noble self</p>

<p>I am sure is sent for.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Brabantio</span>  How? The Duke in council?</p>

<p>In this time of the night? Bring him away;</p>

<p>Mine’s not an idle cause. The Duke himself,</p>

<p>Or any of my brothers of the state,</p>

<p>Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own.</p>

<p>For if such actions may have passage free,</p>

<p>Bondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.</p>
