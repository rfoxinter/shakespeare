<p><center><i>[Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.</p>

<p>Let’s teach ourselves that honorable stop</p>

<p>Not to outsport discretion.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span></p>

<p>Iago hath direction what to do,</p>

<p>But notwithstanding, with my personal eye</p>

<p>Will I look to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Iago is most honest.</p>

<p>Michael, goodnight. Tomorrow with your earliest</p>

<p>Let me have speech with you. <i>[To Desdemona.]</i> Come,</p>

<p>my dear love,</p>

<p>The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;</p>

<p>That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.–</p>

<p>Goodnight.</p>

<p><center><i>[Othello and Desdemona exit, with Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Iago.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span></p>

<p>Welcome, Iago. We must to the watch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Not this hour, lieutenant. ’Tis not yet ten o’ th’</p>

<p>clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of</p>

<p>his Desdemona–who let us not therefore blame;</p>

<p>he hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and</p>

<p>she is sport for Jove.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  She’s a most exquisite lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  And, I’ll warrant her, full of game.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Indeed, she’s a most fresh and delicate</p>

<p>creature.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley</p>

<p>to provocation.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  An inviting eye, and yet methinks right</p>

<p>modest.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  She is indeed perfection.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant,</p>

<p>I have a stoup of wine; and here without are a</p>

<p>brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a</p>

<p>measure to the health of black Othello.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and</p>

<p>unhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish</p>

<p>courtesy would invent some other custom of</p>

<p>entertainment.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  O, they are our friends! But one cup; I’ll drink</p>

<p>for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was</p>

<p>craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it</p>

<p>makes here. I am unfortunate in the infirmity and</p>

<p>dare not task my weakness with any more.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  What, man! ’Tis a night of revels. The gallants</p>

<p>desire it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Where are they?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Here at the door. I pray you, call them in.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  I’ll do ’t, but it dislikes me.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>If I can fasten but one cup upon him</p>

<p>With that which he hath drunk tonight already,</p>

<p>He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense</p>

<p>As my young mistress’ dog. Now my sick fool</p>

<p>Roderigo,</p>

<p>Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,</p>

<p>To Desdemona hath tonight caroused</p>

<p>Potations pottle-deep; and he’s to watch.</p>

<p>Three else of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits</p>

<p>That hold their honors in a wary distance,</p>

<p>The very elements of this warlike isle,</p>

<p>Have I tonight flustered with flowing cups;</p>

<p>And they watch too. Now, ’mongst this flock of</p>

<p>drunkards</p>

<p>Am I to put our Cassio in some action</p>

<p>That may offend the isle. But here they come.</p>

<p>If consequence do but approve my dream,</p>

<p>My boat sails freely both with wind and stream.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cassio, Montano, and Gentlemen, followed by</p>

<p>Servants with wine.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  ’Fore God, they have given me a rouse</p>

<p>already.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montano</span>  Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I</p>

<p>am a soldier.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Some wine, ho!</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>And let me the cannikin clink, clink,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And let me the cannikin clink.</i></p>

<p>        <i>A soldier’s a man,</i></p>

<p>        <i>O, man’s life’s but a span,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Why, then, let a soldier drink.</i></p>

<p>Some wine, boys!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  ’Fore God, an excellent song.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  I learned it in England, where indeed they are</p>

<p>most potent in potting. Your Dane, your German,</p>

<p>and your swag-bellied Hollander–drink, ho!–are</p>

<p>nothing to your English.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Is your Englishman so exquisite in his</p>

<p>drinking?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane</p>

<p>dead drunk. He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.</p>

<p>He gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next</p>

<p>pottle can be filled.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  To the health of our general!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montano</span>  I am for it, lieutenant, and I’ll do you</p>

<p>justice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  O sweet England!</p>

<p><i>[Sings.]</i>     <i>King Stephen was and-a worthy peer,</i></p>

<p>        <i>His breeches cost him but a crown;</i></p>

<p>     <i>He held them sixpence all too dear;</i></p>

<p>        <i>With that he called the tailor lown.</i></p>

<p>     <i>He was a wight of high renown,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And thou art but of low degree;</i></p>

<p>     <i>’Tis pride that pulls the country down,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Then take thy auld cloak about thee.</i></p>

<p>Some wine, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  ’Fore God, this is a more exquisite song than</p>

<p>the other!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Will you hear ’t again?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place</p>

<p>that does those things. Well, God’s above all; and</p>

<p>there be souls must be saved, and there be souls</p>

<p>must not be saved.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  It’s true, good lieutenant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  For mine own part–no offense to the General,</p>

<p>nor any man of quality–I hope to be saved.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  And so do I too, lieutenant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Ay, but, by your leave, not before me. The</p>

<p>Lieutenant is to be saved before the Ancient. Let’s</p>

<p>have no more of this. Let’s to our affairs. God</p>

<p>forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let’s look to our</p>

<p>business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk. This</p>

<p>is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my</p>

<p>left. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough,</p>

<p>and I speak well enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>  Excellent well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Why, very well then. You must not think then</p>

<p>that I am drunk.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montano</span></p>

<p>To th’ platform, masters. Come, let’s set the watch.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gentlemen exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span> <i>[to Montano]</i></p>

<p>You see this fellow that is gone before?</p>

<p>He’s a soldier fit to stand by Caesar</p>

<p>And give direction; and do but see his vice.</p>

<p>’Tis to his virtue a just equinox,</p>

<p>The one as long as th’ other. ’Tis pity of him.</p>

<p>I fear the trust Othello puts him in,</p>

<p>On some odd time of his infirmity,</p>

<p>Will shake this island.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montano</span>  But is he often thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>’Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.</p>

<p>He’ll watch the horologe a double set</p>

<p>If drink rock not his cradle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montano</span>  It were well</p>

<p>The General were put in mind of it.</p>

<p>Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature</p>

<p>Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio</p>

<p>And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Roderigo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span> <i>[aside to Roderigo]</i>  How now, Roderigo?</p>

<p>I pray you, after the Lieutenant, go.</p>

<p><center><i>[Roderigo exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montano</span></p>

<p>And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor</p>

<p>Should hazard such a place as his own second</p>

<p>With one of an engraffed infirmity.</p>

<p>It were an honest action to say so</p>

<p>To the Moor.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Not I, for this fair island.</p>

<p>I do love Cassio well and would do much</p>

<p>To cure him of this evil–     <i><i>[“Help, help!” within.]</i></i></p>

<p>But hark! What noise?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cassio, pursuing Roderigo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Zounds, you rogue, you rascal!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montano</span>  What’s the matter, lieutenant?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  A knave teach me my duty? I’ll beat the knave</p>

<p>into a twiggen bottle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span>  Beat me?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Dost thou prate, rogue?     <i><i>[He hits Roderigo.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montano</span>  Nay, good lieutenant. I pray you, sir, hold</p>

<p>your hand.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Let me go, sir, or I’ll knock you o’er the</p>

<p>mazard.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montano</span>  Come, come, you’re drunk.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Drunk?</p>

<p><center><i>[They fight.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span> <i>[aside to Roderigo]</i></p>

<p>Away, I say! Go out and cry a mutiny.</p>

<p><center><i>[Roderigo exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Nay, good lieutenant.–God’s will, gentlemen!–</p>

<p>Help, ho! Lieutenant–sir–Montano–sir–</p>

<p>Help, masters!–Here’s a goodly watch indeed!</p>

<p><center><i>[A bell is rung.]</i></center></p>

<p>Who’s that which rings the bell? Diablo, ho!</p>

<p>The town will rise. God’s will, lieutenant, hold!</p>

<p>You will be shamed forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Othello and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>What is the matter here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montano</span>  Zounds, I bleed</p>

<p>still.</p>

<p>I am hurt to th’ death. He dies!     <i><i>[He attacks Cassio.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Hold, for your lives!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>Hold, ho! Lieutenant–sir–Montano–</p>

<p>gentlemen–</p>

<p>Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?</p>

<p>Hold! The General speaks to you. Hold, for shame!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>Why, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?</p>

<p>Are we turned Turks, and to ourselves do that</p>

<p>Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?</p>

<p>For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl!</p>

<p>He that stirs next to carve for his own rage</p>

<p>Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.</p>

<p>Silence that dreadful bell. It frights the isle</p>

<p>From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?</p>

<p>Honest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,</p>

<p>Speak. Who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>I do not know. Friends all but now, even now,</p>

<p>In quarter and in terms like bride and groom</p>

<p>Divesting them for bed; and then but now,</p>

<p>As if some planet had unwitted men,</p>

<p>Swords out, and tilting one at other’s breast,</p>

<p>In opposition bloody. I cannot speak</p>

<p>Any beginning to this peevish odds,</p>

<p>And would in action glorious I had lost</p>

<p>Those legs that brought me to a part of it!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span></p>

<p>I pray you pardon me; I cannot speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span></p>

<p>Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil.</p>

<p>The gravity and stillness of your youth</p>

<p>The world hath noted. And your name is great</p>

<p>In mouths of wisest censure. What’s the matter</p>

<p>That you unlace your reputation thus,</p>

<p>And spend your rich opinion for the name</p>

<p>Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montano</span></p>

<p>Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.</p>

<p>Your officer Iago can inform you,</p>

<p>While I spare speech, which something now offends</p>

<p>me,</p>

<p>Of all that I do know; nor know I aught</p>

<p>By me that’s said or done amiss this night,</p>

<p>Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,</p>

<p>And to defend ourselves it be a sin</p>

<p>When violence assails us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  Now, by heaven,</p>

<p>My blood begins my safer guides to rule,</p>

<p>And passion, having my best judgment collied,</p>

<p>Assays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,</p>

<p>Or do but lift this arm, the best of you</p>

<p>Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know</p>

<p>How this foul rout began, who set it on;</p>

<p>And he that is approved in this offense,</p>

<p>Though he had twinned with me, both at a birth,</p>

<p>Shall lose me. What, in a town of war</p>

<p>Yet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear,</p>

<p>To manage private and domestic quarrel,</p>

<p>In night, and on the court and guard of safety?</p>

<p>’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Montano</span></p>

<p>If partially affined, or leagued in office,</p>

<p>Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,</p>

<p>Thou art no soldier.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Touch me not so near.</p>

<p>I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth</p>

<p>Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio.</p>

<p>Yet I persuade myself, to speak the truth</p>

<p>Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:</p>

<p>Montano and myself being in speech,</p>

<p>There comes a fellow crying out for help,</p>

<p>And Cassio following him with determined sword</p>

<p>To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman</p>

<p><center><i>[Pointing to Montano.]</i></center></p>

<p>Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.</p>

<p>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,</p>

<p>Lest by his clamor–as it so fell out–</p>

<p>The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,</p>

<p>Outran my purpose, and I returned the rather</p>

<p>For that I heard the clink and fall of swords</p>

<p>And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight</p>

<p>I ne’er might say before. When I came back–</p>

<p>For this was brief–I found them close together</p>

<p>At blow and thrust, even as again they were</p>

<p>When you yourself did part them.</p>

<p>More of this matter cannot I report.</p>

<p>But men are men; the best sometimes forget.</p>

<p>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,</p>

<p>As men in rage strike those that wish them best,</p>

<p>Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received</p>

<p>From him that fled some strange indignity</p>

<p>Which patience could not pass.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  I know, Iago,</p>

<p>Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,</p>

<p>Making it light to Cassio.–Cassio, I love thee,</p>

<p>But nevermore be officer of mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Desdemona attended.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look if my gentle love be not raised up!</p>

<p>I’ll make thee an example.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Desdemona</span></p>

<p>What is the matter, dear?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Othello</span>  All’s well now,</p>

<p>sweeting.</p>

<p>Come away to bed. <i>[To Montano.]</i> Sir, for your hurts,</p>

<p>Myself will be your surgeon.–Lead him off.</p>

<p><center><i>[Montano is led off.]</i></center></p>

<p>Iago, look with care about the town</p>

<p>And silence those whom this vile brawl</p>

<p>distracted.–</p>

<p>Come, Desdemona. ’Tis the soldier’s life</p>

<p>To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Iago and Cassio exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  What, are you hurt, lieutenant?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Ay, past all surgery.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Marry, God forbid!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have</p>

<p>lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of</p>

<p>myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,</p>

<p>Iago, my reputation!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  As I am an honest man, I thought you had</p>

<p>received some bodily wound. There is more sense</p>

<p>in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and</p>

<p>most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost</p>

<p>without deserving. You have lost no reputation at</p>

<p>all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What,</p>

<p>man, there are ways to recover the General again!</p>

<p>You are but now cast in his mood–a punishment</p>

<p>more in policy than in malice, even so as one would</p>

<p>beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious</p>

<p>lion. Sue to him again and he’s yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive</p>

<p>so good a commander with so slight, so drunken,</p>

<p>and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak</p>

<p>parrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And discourse</p>

<p>fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou</p>

<p>invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be</p>

<p>known by, let us call thee devil!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  What was he that you followed with your sword?</p>

<p>What had he done to you?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  I know not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Is ’t possible?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  I remember a mass of things, but nothing</p>

<p>distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O</p>

<p>God, that men should put an enemy in their</p>

<p>mouths to steal away their brains! That we should</p>

<p>with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause transform</p>

<p>ourselves into beasts!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Why, but you are now well enough. How came</p>

<p>you thus recovered?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give</p>

<p>place to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows</p>

<p>me another, to make me frankly despise myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time,</p>

<p>the place, and the condition of this country stands,</p>

<p>I could heartily wish this had not so befallen. But</p>

<p>since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell</p>

<p>me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as</p>

<p>Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be</p>

<p>now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently</p>

<p>a beast! O, strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed,</p>

<p>and the ingredient is a devil.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,</p>

<p>if it be well used. Exclaim no more against it.</p>

<p>And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  I have well approved it, sir.–I drunk!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  You or any man living may be drunk at a time,</p>

<p>man. I’ll tell you what you shall do. Our general’s</p>

<p>wife is now the general: I may say so in this</p>

<p>respect, for that he hath devoted and given up</p>

<p>himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement</p>

<p>of her parts and graces. Confess yourself</p>

<p>freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your</p>

<p>place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so</p>

<p>blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her</p>

<p>goodness not to do more than she is requested. This</p>

<p>broken joint between you and her husband entreat</p>

<p>her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay</p>

<p>worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow</p>

<p>stronger than it was before.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  You advise me well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest</p>

<p>kindness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I</p>

<p>will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake</p>

<p>for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check</p>

<p>me here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span>  You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant. I</p>

<p>must to the watch.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cassio</span>  Good night, honest Iago.     <i><i>[Cassio exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>And what’s he, then, that says I play the villain,</p>

<p>When this advice is free I give and honest,</p>

<p>Probal to thinking, and indeed the course</p>

<p>To win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy</p>

<p>Th’ inclining Desdemona to subdue</p>

<p>In any honest suit. She’s framed as fruitful</p>

<p>As the free elements. And then for her</p>

<p>To win the Moor–were ’t to renounce his baptism,</p>

<p>All seals and symbols of redeemed sin–</p>

<p>His soul is so enfettered to her love</p>

<p>That she may make, unmake, do what she list,</p>

<p>Even as her appetite shall play the god</p>

<p>With his weak function. How am I then a villain</p>

<p>To counsel Cassio to this parallel course</p>

<p>Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!</p>

<p>When devils will the blackest sins put on,</p>

<p>They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,</p>

<p>As I do now. For whiles this honest fool</p>

<p>Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,</p>

<p>And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,</p>

<p>I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear:</p>

<p>That she repeals him for her body’s lust;</p>

<p>And by how much she strives to do him good,</p>

<p>She shall undo her credit with the Moor.</p>

<p>So will I turn her virtue into pitch,</p>

<p>And out of her own goodness make the net</p>

<p>That shall enmesh them all.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Roderigo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Roderigo?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Roderigo</span>  I do follow here in the chase, not like a</p>

<p>hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My</p>

<p>money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly</p>

<p>well cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I</p>

<p>shall have so much experience for my pains, and so,</p>

<p>with no money at all and a little more wit, return</p>

<p>again to Venice.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Iago</span></p>

<p>How poor are they that have not patience!</p>

<p>What wound did ever heal but by degrees?</p>

<p>Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,</p>

<p>And wit depends on dilatory time.</p>

<p>Does ’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,</p>

<p>And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashiered Cassio.</p>

<p>Though other things grow fair against the sun,</p>

<p>Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.</p>

<p>Content thyself awhile. By th’ Mass, ’tis morning!</p>

<p>Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.</p>

<p>Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.</p>

<p>Away, I say! Thou shalt know more hereafter.</p>

<p>Nay, get thee gone.     <i><i>[Roderigo exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Two things are to be done.</p>

<p>My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.</p>

<p>I’ll set her on.</p>

<p>Myself the while to draw the Moor apart</p>

<p>And bring him jump when he may Cassio find</p>

<p>Soliciting his wife. Ay, that’s the way.</p>

<p>Dull not device by coldness and delay.</p>
