<p><center><i>[Enter Othello and Emilia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  You have seen nothing then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>But then I saw no harm, and then I heard</p>

<p>Each syllable that breath made up between them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>What, did they never whisper?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Never, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Nor send you out o’ th’ way?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Never.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Never, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  That’s strange.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,</p>

<p>Lay down my soul at stake. If you think other,</p>

<p>Remove your thought. It doth abuse your bosom.</p>

<p>If any wretch have put this in your head,</p>

<p>Let heaven requite it with the serpent’s curse,</p>

<p>For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,</p>

<p>There’s no man happy. The purest of their wives</p>

<p>Is foul as slander.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Bid her come hither. Go.</p>

<p><center><i>[Emilia exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>She says enough. Yet she’s a simple bawd</p>

<p>That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,</p>

<p>A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.</p>

<p>And yet she’ll kneel and pray. I have seen her do ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Desdemona and Emilia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  My lord, what is your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Pray you, chuck, come hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  What is your</p>

<p>pleasure?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Let me see your eyes. Look in my face.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  What horrible fancy’s this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc> <i>[to Emilia]</i>  Some of your function,</p>

<p>mistress.</p>

<p>Leave procreants alone, and shut the door.</p>

<p>Cough, or cry “hem,” if anybody come.</p>

<p>Your mystery, your mystery! Nay, dispatch.</p>

<p><center><i>[Emilia exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc> <i>[kneeling]</i></p>

<p>Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?</p>

<p>I understand a fury in your words,</p>

<p>But not the words.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Why? What art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Come, swear it. Damn thyself,</p>

<p>Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves</p>

<p>Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double</p>

<p>damned.</p>

<p>Swear thou art honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Heaven doth truly know it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc> <i>[standing]</i></p>

<p>To whom, my lord? With whom? How am I false?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Ah, Desdemon, away, away, away!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Alas the heavy day, why do you weep?</p>

<p>Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?</p>

<p>If haply you my father do suspect</p>

<p>An instrument of this your calling back,</p>

<p>Lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,</p>

<p>I have lost him too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Had it pleased heaven</p>

<p>To try me with affliction, had they rained</p>

<p>All kind of sores and shames on my bare head,</p>

<p>Steeped me in poverty to the very lips,</p>

<p>Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,</p>

<p>I should have found in some place of my soul</p>

<p>A drop of patience. But alas, to make me</p>

<p>A fixed figure for the time of scorn</p>

<p>To point his slow unmoving finger at–</p>

<p>Yet could I bear that too, well, very well.</p>

<p>But there where I have garnered up my heart,</p>

<p>Where either I must live or bear no life,</p>

<p>The fountain from the which my current runs</p>

<p>Or else dries up–to be discarded thence,</p>

<p>Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads</p>

<p>To knot and gender in–turn thy complexion there,</p>

<p>Patience, thou young and rose-lipped cherubin,</p>

<p>Ay, there look grim as hell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,</p>

<p>That quicken even with blowing! O thou weed,</p>

<p>Who art so lovely fair, and smell’st so sweet</p>

<p>That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst</p>

<p>ne’er been born!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,</p>

<p>Made to write “whore” upon? What committed?</p>

<p>Committed? O thou public commoner,</p>

<p>I should make very forges of my cheeks</p>

<p>That would to cinders burn up modesty,</p>

<p>Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed?</p>

<p>Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;</p>

<p>The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets</p>

<p>Is hushed within the hollow mine of earth</p>

<p>And will not hear ’t. What committed?</p>

<p>Impudent strumpet!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  By heaven, you do me wrong!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Are not you a strumpet?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  No, as I am a Christian!</p>

<p>If to preserve this vessel for my lord</p>

<p>From any other foul unlawful touch</p>

<p>Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  What, not a whore?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  No, as I shall be saved.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Is ’t possible?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>O, heaven forgive us!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I cry you mercy, then.</p>

<p>I took you for that cunning whore of Venice</p>

<p>That married with Othello.–You, mistress,</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Emilia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>That have the office opposite to Saint Peter</p>

<p>And keeps the gate of hell–you, you, ay, you!</p>

<p>We have done our course. There’s money for your</p>

<p>pains.     <i><i>[He gives her money.]</i></i></p>

<p>I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?</p>

<p>How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Faith, half asleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Good madam, what’s the matter with my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  With who?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Why, with my lord, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Who is thy lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  He that is yours, sweet lady.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia.</p>

<p>I cannot weep, nor answers have I none</p>

<p>But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight</p>

<p>Lay on my bed my wedding sheets. Remember.</p>

<p>And call thy husband hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Here’s a change indeed.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>’Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.</p>

<p>How have I been behaved that he might stick</p>

<p>The small’st opinion on my least misuse?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Iago and Emilia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>What is your pleasure, madam? How is ’t with you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes</p>

<p>Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.</p>

<p>He might have chid me so, for, in good faith,</p>

<p>I am a child to chiding.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  What is the matter, lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,</p>

<p>Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her</p>

<p>As true hearts cannot bear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Am I that name, Iago?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  What name, fair</p>

<p>lady?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Such as she said my lord did say I was.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>He called her “whore.” A beggar in his drink</p>

<p>Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Why did he so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>I do not know. I am sure I am none such.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Do not weep, do not weep! Alas the day!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Hath she forsook so many noble matches,</p>

<p>Her father and her country and her friends,</p>

<p>To be called “whore”? Would it not make one</p>

<p>weep?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  It is my wretched fortune.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Beshrew him for ’t! How comes this trick upon him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Nay, heaven doth know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>I will be hanged if some eternal villain,</p>

<p>Some busy and insinuating rogue,</p>

<p>Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,</p>

<p>Have not devised this slander. I will be hanged else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Fie, there is no such man. It is impossible.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>If any such there be, heaven pardon him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>A halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!</p>

<p>Why should he call her “whore”? Who keeps her</p>

<p>company?</p>

<p>What place? What time? What form? What</p>

<p>likelihood?</p>

<p>The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave,</p>

<p>Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.</p>

<p>O heaven, that such companions thou ’dst unfold,</p>

<p>And put in every honest hand a whip</p>

<p>To lash the rascals naked through the world,</p>

<p>Even from the east to th’ west!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Speak within door.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was</p>

<p>That turned your wit the seamy side without</p>

<p>And made you to suspect me with the Moor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>You are a fool. Go to!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Alas, Iago,</p>

<p>What shall I do to win my lord again?</p>

<p>Good friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven,</p>

<p>I know not how I lost him. <i>[She kneels.]</i> Here I</p>

<p>kneel.</p>

<p>If e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love,</p>

<p>Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,</p>

<p>Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense</p>

<p>Delighted them in any other form,</p>

<p>Or that I do not yet, and ever did,</p>

<p>And ever will–though he do shake me off</p>

<p>To beggarly divorcement–love him dearly,</p>

<p>Comfort forswear me! <i>[She stands.]</i> Unkindness may</p>

<p>do much,</p>

<p>And his unkindness may defeat my life,</p>

<p>But never taint my love. I cannot say “whore”–</p>

<p>It does abhor me now I speak the word.</p>

<p>To do the act that might the addition earn,</p>

<p>Not the world’s mass of vanity could make me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>I pray you be content. ’Tis but his humor.</p>

<p>The business of the state does him offense,</p>

<p>And he does chide with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>If ’twere no other–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  It is but so, I warrant.</p>

<p><center><i>[Trumpets sound.]</i></center></p>

<p>Hark how these instruments summon to supper.</p>

<p>The messengers of Venice stays the meat.</p>

<p>Go in and weep not. All things shall be well.</p>

<p><center><i>[Desdemona and Emilia exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Roderigo.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Roderigo?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  I do not find</p>

<p>That thou deal’st justly with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  What in the contrary?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  Every day thou daff’st me with some device,</p>

<p>Iago, and rather, as it seems to me now,</p>

<p>keep’st from me all conveniency than suppliest me</p>

<p>with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no</p>

<p>longer endure it. Nor am I yet persuaded to put up</p>

<p>in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Will you hear me, Roderigo?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  Faith, I have heard too much, and your</p>

<p>words and performances are no kin together.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  You charge me most unjustly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  With naught but truth. I have wasted myself</p>

<p>out of my means. The jewels you have had</p>

<p>from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have</p>

<p>corrupted a votaress. You have told me she hath</p>

<p>received them, and returned me expectations and</p>

<p>comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I</p>

<p>find none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Well, go to! Very well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  “Very well.” “Go to!” I cannot go to, man,</p>

<p>nor ’tis not very well! By this hand, I say ’tis very</p>

<p>scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Very well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  I tell you ’tis not very well! I will make</p>

<p>myself known to Desdemona. If she will return me</p>

<p>my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my</p>

<p>unlawful solicitation. If not, assure yourself I will</p>

<p>seek satisfaction of you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  You have said now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  Ay, and said nothing but what I protest</p>

<p>intendment of doing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even</p>

<p>from this instant do build on thee a better opinion</p>

<p>than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo.</p>

<p>Thou hast taken against me a most just exception,</p>

<p>but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy</p>

<p>affair.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  It hath not appeared.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your</p>

<p>suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,</p>

<p>Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed which I</p>

<p>have greater reason to believe now than ever–I</p>

<p>mean purpose, courage, and valor–this night show</p>

<p>it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,</p>

<p>take me from this world with treachery and</p>

<p>devise engines for my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  Well, what is it? Is it within reason and</p>

<p>compass?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Sir, there is especial commission come from</p>

<p>Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  Is that true? Why, then, Othello and Desdemona</p>

<p>return again to Venice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  O, no. He goes into Mauritania and takes away</p>

<p>with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be</p>

<p>lingered here by some accident–wherein none</p>

<p>can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  How do you mean, removing him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s</p>

<p>place: knocking out his brains.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  And that you would have me to do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He</p>

<p>sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to</p>

<p>him. He knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If</p>

<p>you will watch his going thence (which I will</p>

<p>fashion to fall out between twelve and one), you may</p>

<p>take him at your pleasure. I will be near to second</p>

<p>your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come,</p>

<p>stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will</p>

<p>show you such a necessity in his death that you shall</p>

<p>think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high</p>

<p>supper time, and the night grows to waste. About it!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  I will hear further reason for this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  And you shall be satisfied.</p>
