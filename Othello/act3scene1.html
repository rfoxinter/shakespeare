<p><center><i>[Enter Cassio with Musicians.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>Masters, play here (I will content your pains)</p>

<p>Something that’s brief; and bid “Good morrow,</p>

<p>general.”     <i><i>[They play.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter the Clown.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clown</sc>  Why masters, have your instruments been in</p>

<p>Naples, that they speak i’ th’ nose thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Musician</sc>  How, sir, how?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clown</sc>  Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Musician</sc>  Ay, marry, are they, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clown</sc>  O, thereby hangs a tail.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Musician</sc>  Whereby hangs a tale, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clown</sc>  Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I</p>

<p>know. But, masters, here’s money for you; and the</p>

<p>General so likes your music that he desires you, for</p>

<p>love’s sake, to make no more noise with it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Musician</sc>  Well, sir, we will not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clown</sc>  If you have any music that may not be heard, to</p>

<p>’t again. But, as they say, to hear music the General</p>

<p>does not greatly care.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Musician</sc>  We have none such, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clown</sc>  Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll</p>

<p>away. Go, vanish into air, away!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Musicians exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Dost thou hear, mine honest friend?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clown</sc>  No, I hear not your honest friend. I hear you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Prithee, keep up thy quillets.     <i><i>[Giving money.]</i></i></p>

<p>There’s a poor piece of gold for thee. If the gentlewoman</p>

<p>that attends the General’s wife be stirring,</p>

<p>tell her there’s one Cassio entreats her a little favor</p>

<p>of speech. Wilt thou do this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Clown</sc>  She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall</p>

<p>seem to notify unto her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>Do, good my friend.     <i><i>[Clown exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Iago.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>In happy time, Iago.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  You have not been abed, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Why, no. The day had broke</p>

<p>Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,</p>

<p>To send in to your wife. My suit to her</p>

<p>Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona</p>

<p>Procure me some access.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I’ll send her to you presently,</p>

<p>And I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor</p>

<p>Out of the way, that your converse and business</p>

<p>May be more free.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>I humbly thank you for ’t. <i>[Iago exits.]</i> I never</p>

<p>knew</p>

<p>A Florentine more kind and honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Emilia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Good morrow, good lieutenant. I am sorry</p>

<p>For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.</p>

<p>The General and his wife are talking of it,</p>

<p>And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies</p>

<p>That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus</p>

<p>And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom</p>

<p>He might not but refuse you. But he protests he</p>

<p>loves you</p>

<p>And needs no other suitor but his likings</p>

<p>To take the safest occasion by the front</p>

<p>To bring you in again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Yet I beseech you,</p>

<p>If you think fit, or that it may be done,</p>

<p>Give me advantage of some brief discourse</p>

<p>With Desdemon alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Pray you come in.</p>

<p>I will bestow you where you shall have time</p>

<p>To speak your bosom freely.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  I am much bound to you.</p>
