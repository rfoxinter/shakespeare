<p><center><i>[Enter Montano and two Gentlemen.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montano</sc></p>

<p>What from the cape can you discern at sea?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood.</p>

<p>I cannot ’twixt the heaven and the main</p>

<p>Descry a sail.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montano</sc></p>

<p>Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land.</p>

<p>A fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements.</p>

<p>If it hath ruffianed so upon the sea,</p>

<p>What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,</p>

<p>Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>A segregation of the Turkish fleet.</p>

<p>For do but stand upon the foaming shore,</p>

<p>The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds,</p>

<p>The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous</p>

<p>mane,</p>

<p>Seems to cast water on the burning Bear</p>

<p>And quench the guards of th’ ever-fixed pole.</p>

<p>I never did like molestation view</p>

<p>On the enchafed flood.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montano</sc>  If that the Turkish fleet</p>

<p>Be not ensheltered and embayed, they are drowned.</p>

<p>It is impossible to bear it out.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a third Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  News, lads! Our wars are done.</p>

<p>The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks</p>

<p>That their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice</p>

<p>Hath seen a grievous wrack and sufferance</p>

<p>On most part of their fleet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montano</sc></p>

<p>How? Is this true?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  The ship is here put in,</p>

<p>A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,</p>

<p>Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,</p>

<p>Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,</p>

<p>And is in full commission here for Cyprus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montano</sc></p>

<p>I am glad on ’t. ’Tis a worthy governor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort</p>

<p>Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly</p>

<p>And prays the Moor be safe, for they were parted</p>

<p>With foul and violent tempest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montano</sc>  Pray heaven he be;</p>

<p>For I have served him, and the man commands</p>

<p>Like a full soldier. Let’s to the seaside, ho!</p>

<p>As well to see the vessel that’s come in</p>

<p>As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,</p>

<p>Even till we make the main and th’ aerial blue</p>

<p>An indistinct regard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  Come, let’s do so;</p>

<p>For every minute is expectancy</p>

<p>Of more arrivance.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cassio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,</p>

<p>That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens</p>

<p>Give him defense against the elements,</p>

<p>For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montano</sc>  Is he well shipped?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>His bark is stoutly timbered, and his pilot</p>

<p>Of very expert and approved allowance;</p>

<p>Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,</p>

<p>Stand in bold cure.</p>

<p><center><i>[Voices cry within. “A sail, a sail, a sail!”]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  What noise?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>The town is empty; on the brow o’ th’ sea</p>

<p>Stand ranks of people, and they cry “A sail!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>My hopes do shape him for the Governor.</p>

<p><center><i>[A shot.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>They do discharge their shot of courtesy.</p>

<p>Our friends, at least.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  I pray you, sir, go forth,</p>

<p>And give us truth who ’tis that is arrived.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc>  I shall.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montano</sc></p>

<p>But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>Most fortunately. He hath achieved a maid</p>

<p>That paragons description and wild fame,</p>

<p>One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,</p>

<p>And in th’ essential vesture of creation</p>

<p>Does tire the ingener.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Second Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now? Who has put in?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>’Tis one Iago, ancient to the General.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>’Has had most favorable and happy speed!</p>

<p>Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,</p>

<p>The guttered rocks and congregated sands</p>

<p>(Traitors ensteeped to clog the guiltless keel),</p>

<p>As having sense of beauty, do omit</p>

<p>Their mortal natures, letting go safely by</p>

<p>The divine Desdemona.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Montano</sc>  What is she?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>She that I spake of, our great captain’s captain,</p>

<p>Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,</p>

<p>Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts</p>

<p>A sennight’s speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,</p>

<p>And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,</p>

<p>That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,</p>

<p>Make love’s quick pants in Desdemona’s arms,</p>

<p>Give renewed fire to our extincted spirits,</p>

<p>And bring all Cyprus comfort!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Desdemona, Iago, Roderigo, and Emilia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O, behold,</p>

<p>The riches of the ship is come on shore!</p>

<p>You men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>Hail to thee, lady, and the grace of heaven,</p>

<p>Before, behind thee, and on every hand</p>

<p>Enwheel thee round.     <i><i>[He rises.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  I thank you, valiant Cassio.</p>

<p>What tidings can you tell of my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>He is not yet arrived, nor know I aught</p>

<p>But that he’s well and will be shortly here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>O, but I fear–How lost you company?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>The great contention of sea and skies</p>

<p>Parted our fellowship.</p>

<p><center><i>[Within “A sail, a sail!” A shot.]</i></center></p>

<p>But hark, a sail!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>They give their greeting to the citadel.</p>

<p>This likewise is a friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  See for the news.</p>

<p><center><i>[Second Gentleman exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Good ancient, you are welcome. Welcome, mistress.</p>

<p><center><i>[He kisses Emilia.]</i></center></p>

<p>Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,</p>

<p>That I extend my manners. ’Tis my breeding</p>

<p>That gives me this bold show of courtesy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Sir, would she give you so much of her lips</p>

<p>As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,</p>

<p>You would have enough.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Alas, she has no speech!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  In faith, too much.</p>

<p>I find it still when I have list to sleep.</p>

<p>Marry, before your Ladyship, I grant,</p>

<p>She puts her tongue a little in her heart</p>

<p>And chides with thinking.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  You have little cause to say so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Come on, come on! You are pictures out of door,</p>

<p>bells in your parlors, wildcats in your kitchens,</p>

<p>saints in your injuries, devils being offended, players</p>

<p>in your huswifery, and huswives in your beds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Oh, fie upon thee, slanderer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk.</p>

<p>You rise to play, and go to bed to work.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>You shall not write my praise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  No, let me not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>What wouldst write of me if thou shouldst praise</p>

<p>me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>O, gentle lady, do not put me to ’t,</p>

<p>For I am nothing if not critical.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Come on, assay.–There’s one gone to the harbor?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Ay, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I am not merry, but I do beguile</p>

<p>The thing I am by seeming otherwise.–</p>

<p>Come, how wouldst thou praise me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I am about it, but indeed my invention comes</p>

<p>from my pate as birdlime does from frieze: it</p>

<p>plucks out brains and all. But my muse labors, and</p>

<p>thus she is delivered:</p>

<p>     <i>If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,</i></p>

<p>     <i>The one’s for use, the other useth it.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Well praised! How if she be black and witty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>     <i>If she be black, and thereto have a wit,</i></p>

<p>     <i>She’ll find a white that shall her blackness hit.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Worse and worse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  How if fair and foolish?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>     <i>She never yet was foolish that was fair,</i></p>

<p>     <i>For even her folly helped her to an heir.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  These are old fond paradoxes to make</p>

<p>fools laugh i’ th’ alehouse. What miserable praise</p>

<p>hast thou for her that’s foul and foolish?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>     <i>There’s none so foul and foolish thereunto,</i></p>

<p>     <i>But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the</p>

<p>worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on</p>

<p>a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority</p>

<p>of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very</p>

<p>malice itself?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>     <i>She that was ever fair and never proud,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Never lacked gold and yet went never gay,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fled from her wish, and yet said “Now I may,”</i></p>

<p>     <i>She that being angered, her revenge being nigh,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,</i></p>

<p>     <i>She that in wisdom never was so frail</i></p>

<p>     <i>To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail,</i></p>

<p>     <i>She that could think and ne’er disclose her mind,</i></p>

<p>     <i>See suitors following and not look behind,</i></p>

<p>     <i>She was a wight, if ever such wight were–</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  To do what?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>     <i>To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  O, most lame and impotent conclusion!</p>

<p>–Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy</p>

<p>husband.–How say you, Cassio? Is he not a most</p>

<p>profane and liberal counselor?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  He speaks home, madam. You may relish him</p>

<p>more in the soldier than in the scholar.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cassio takes Desdemona’s hand.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  He takes her by the palm. Ay, well said,</p>

<p>whisper. With as little a web as this will I ensnare as</p>

<p>great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do. I will</p>

<p>gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, ’tis</p>

<p>so indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of</p>

<p>your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not</p>

<p>kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again</p>

<p>you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well</p>

<p>kissed; an excellent courtesy! ’Tis so, indeed. Yet</p>

<p>again your fingers to your lips? Would they were</p>

<p>clyster pipes for your sake!     <i><i>[Trumpets within.]</i></i></p>

<p>The Moor. I know his trumpet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  ’Tis truly so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Let’s meet him and receive him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Lo, where he comes!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Othello and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>O, my fair warrior!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  My dear Othello!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>It gives me wonder great as my content</p>

<p>To see you here before me. O my soul’s joy!</p>

<p>If after every tempest come such calms,</p>

<p>May the winds blow till they have wakened death,</p>

<p>And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas</p>

<p>Olympus high, and duck again as low</p>

<p>As hell’s from heaven! If it were now to die,</p>

<p>’Twere now to be most happy, for I fear</p>

<p>My soul hath her content so absolute</p>

<p>That not another comfort like to this</p>

<p>Succeeds in unknown fate.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  The heavens forbid</p>

<p>But that our loves and comforts should increase</p>

<p>Even as our days do grow!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Amen to that, sweet powers!</p>

<p>I cannot speak enough of this content.</p>

<p>It stops me here; it is too much of joy.     <i><i>[They kiss.]</i></i></p>

<p>And this, and this, the greatest discords be</p>

<p>That e’er our hearts shall make!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  O, you are well tuned now,</p>

<p>But I’ll set down the pegs that make this music,</p>

<p>As honest as I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Come. Let us to the castle.–</p>

<p>News, friends! Our wars are done. The Turks are</p>

<p>drowned.</p>

<p>How does my old acquaintance of this isle?–</p>

<p>Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus.</p>

<p>I have found great love amongst them. O, my sweet,</p>

<p>I prattle out of fashion, and I dote</p>

<p>In mine own comforts.–I prithee, good Iago,</p>

<p>Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.</p>

<p>Bring thou the master to the citadel.</p>

<p>He is a good one, and his worthiness</p>

<p>Does challenge much respect.–Come, Desdemona.</p>

<p>Once more, well met at Cyprus.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Iago and Roderigo exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc> <i>[to a departing Attendant]</i>  Do thou meet me presently</p>

<p>at the harbor. <i>[To Roderigo.]</i> Come hither. If</p>

<p>thou be’st valiant–as they say base men being in</p>

<p>love have then a nobility in their natures more than</p>

<p>is native to them–list me. The Lieutenant tonight</p>

<p>watches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee</p>

<p>this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  With him? Why, ’tis not possible.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.</p>

<p>Mark me with what violence she first loved the</p>

<p>Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical</p>

<p>lies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not</p>

<p>thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed. And</p>

<p>what delight shall she have to look on the devil?</p>

<p>When the blood is made dull with the act of sport,</p>

<p>there should be, again to inflame it and to give</p>

<p>satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy</p>

<p>in years, manners, and beauties, all which the Moor</p>

<p>is defective in. Now, for want of these required</p>

<p>conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself</p>

<p>abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and</p>

<p>abhor the Moor. Very nature will instruct her in it</p>

<p>and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir,</p>

<p>this granted–as it is a most pregnant and unforced</p>

<p>position–who stands so eminent in the degree of</p>

<p>this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble, no</p>

<p>further conscionable than in putting on the mere</p>

<p>form of civil and humane seeming for the better</p>

<p>compassing of his salt and most hidden loose</p>

<p>affection. Why, none, why, none! A slipper and</p>

<p>subtle knave, a finder-out of occasions, that has an</p>

<p>eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though</p>

<p>true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave!</p>

<p>Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all</p>

<p>those requisites in him that folly and green minds</p>

<p>look after. A pestilent complete knave, and the</p>

<p>woman hath found him already.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  I cannot believe that in her. She’s full of</p>

<p>most blessed condition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Blessed fig’s end! The wine she drinks is made of</p>

<p>grapes. If she had been blessed, she would never</p>

<p>have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou</p>

<p>not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst</p>

<p>not mark that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  Yes, that I did. But that was but courtesy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Lechery, by this hand! An index and obscure</p>

<p>prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts.</p>

<p>They met so near with their lips that their breaths</p>

<p>embraced together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!</p>

<p>When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard</p>

<p>at hand comes the master and main exercise, th’</p>

<p>incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled</p>

<p>by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you</p>

<p>tonight. For the command, I’ll lay ’t upon you.</p>

<p>Cassio knows you not. I’ll not be far from you. Do</p>

<p>you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by</p>

<p>speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from</p>

<p>what other course you please, which the time shall</p>

<p>more favorably minister.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  Well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Sir, he’s rash and very sudden in choler, and</p>

<p>haply may strike at you. Provoke him that he may,</p>

<p>for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to</p>

<p>mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no</p>

<p>true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So</p>

<p>shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by</p>

<p>the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the</p>

<p>impediment most profitably removed, without the</p>

<p>which there were no expectation of our prosperity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  I will do this, if you can bring it to any</p>

<p>opportunity.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I</p>

<p>must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  Adieu.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>That Cassio loves her, I do well believe ’t.</p>

<p>That she loves him, ’tis apt and of great credit.</p>

<p>The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,</p>

<p>Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,</p>

<p>And I dare think he’ll prove to Desdemona</p>

<p>A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,</p>

<p>Not out of absolute lust (though peradventure</p>

<p>I stand accountant for as great a sin)</p>

<p>But partly led to diet my revenge</p>

<p>For that I do suspect the lusty Moor</p>

<p>Hath leaped into my seat–the thought whereof</p>

<p>Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,</p>

<p>And nothing can or shall content my soul</p>

<p>Till I am evened with him, wife for wife,</p>

<p>Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor</p>

<p>At least into a jealousy so strong</p>

<p>That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,</p>

<p>If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace</p>

<p>For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,</p>

<p>I’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,</p>

<p>Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb</p>

<p>(For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too),</p>

<p>Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me</p>

<p>For making him egregiously an ass</p>

<p>And practicing upon his peace and quiet</p>
