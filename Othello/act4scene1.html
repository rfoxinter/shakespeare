<p><center><i>[Enter Othello and Iago.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Will you think so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Think so, Iago?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  What,</p>

<p>To kiss in private?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  An unauthorized kiss!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Or to be naked with her friend in bed</p>

<p>An hour or more, not meaning any harm?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?</p>

<p>It is hypocrisy against the devil!</p>

<p>They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,</p>

<p>The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt</p>

<p>heaven.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>If they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.</p>

<p>But if I give my wife a handkerchief–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  What then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Why then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,</p>

<p>She may, I think, bestow ’t on any man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>She is protectress of her honor, too.</p>

<p>May she give that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Her honor is an essence that’s not seen;</p>

<p>They have it very oft that have it not.</p>

<p>But for the handkerchief–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.</p>

<p>Thou saidst–O, it comes o’er my memory</p>

<p>As doth the raven o’er the infectious house,</p>

<p>Boding to all–he had my handkerchief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Ay, what of that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  That’s not so good now.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  What</p>

<p>If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?</p>

<p>Or heard him say (as knaves be such abroad,</p>

<p>Who having, by their own importunate suit</p>

<p>Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,</p>

<p>Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose</p>

<p>But they must blab)–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Hath he said anything?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>He hath, my lord, but be you well assured,</p>

<p>No more than he’ll unswear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  What hath he said?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Faith, that he did–I know not what he did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  What? What?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Lie–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  With her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  With her–on her–what you will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Lie with her? Lie on her? We say “lie on her”</p>

<p>when they belie her. Lie with her–Zounds, that’s</p>

<p>fulsome! Handkerchief–confessions–handkerchief.</p>

<p>To confess and be hanged for his labor.</p>

<p>First to be hanged and then to confess–I tremble</p>

<p>at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing</p>

<p>passion without some instruction. It is not</p>

<p>words that shakes me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and</p>

<p>lips–is ’t possible? Confess–handkerchief–O,</p>

<p>devil!     <i><i>[He falls in a trance.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Work on,</p>

<p>My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are</p>

<p>caught,</p>

<p>And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,</p>

<p>All guiltless, meet reproach.–What ho! My lord!</p>

<p>My lord, I say. Othello!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cassio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Cassio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  What’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>My lord is fall’n into an epilepsy.</p>

<p>This is his second fit. He had one yesterday.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>Rub him about the temples.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  No, forbear.</p>

<p>The lethargy must have his quiet course.</p>

<p>If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by</p>

<p>Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs.</p>

<p>Do you withdraw yourself a little while.</p>

<p>He will recover straight. When he is gone,</p>

<p>I would on great occasion speak with you.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cassio exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Dost thou mock me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I mock you not, by heaven!</p>

<p>Would you would bear your fortune like a man!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>A horned man’s a monster and a beast.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>There’s many a beast, then, in a populous city,</p>

<p>And many a civil monster.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Did he confess it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Good sir, be a man!</p>

<p>Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked</p>

<p>May draw with you. There’s millions now alive</p>

<p>That nightly lie in those unproper beds</p>

<p>Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better.</p>

<p>O, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,</p>

<p>To lip a wanton in a secure couch</p>

<p>And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,</p>

<p>And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  O, thou art wise, ’tis certain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Stand you awhile apart.</p>

<p>Confine yourself but in a patient list.</p>

<p>Whilst you were here, o’erwhelmed with your grief–</p>

<p>A passion most unsuiting such a man–</p>

<p>Cassio came hither. I shifted him away</p>

<p>And laid good ’scuses upon your ecstasy,</p>

<p>Bade him anon return and here speak with me,</p>

<p>The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,</p>

<p>And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns</p>

<p>That dwell in every region of his face.</p>

<p>For I will make him tell the tale anew–</p>

<p>Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when</p>

<p>He hath and is again to cope your wife.</p>

<p>I say but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,</p>

<p>Or I shall say you’re all in all in spleen,</p>

<p>And nothing of a man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Dost thou hear, Iago,</p>

<p>I will be found most cunning in my patience,</p>

<p>But (dost thou hear?) most bloody.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  That’s not amiss.</p>

<p>But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?</p>

<p><center><i>[Othello withdraws.]</i></center></p>

<p>Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,</p>

<p>A huswife that by selling her desires</p>

<p>Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature</p>

<p>That dotes on Cassio–as ’tis the strumpet’s plague</p>

<p>To beguile many and be beguiled by one.</p>

<p>He, when he hears of her, cannot restrain</p>

<p>From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cassio.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad,</p>

<p>And his unbookish jealousy must construe</p>

<p>Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behaviors</p>

<p>Quite in the wrong.–How do you, lieutenant?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>The worser that you give me the addition</p>

<p>Whose want even kills me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on ’t.</p>

<p>Now, if this suit lay in Bianca’s power,</p>

<p>How quickly should you speed!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc> <i>[laughing]</i>  Alas, poor caitiff!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Look how he laughs already!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I never knew woman love man so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>Alas, poor rogue, I think i’ faith she loves me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Do you hear, Cassio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Now he importunes him</p>

<p>To tell it o’er. Go to, well said, well said.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>She gives it out that you shall marry her.</p>

<p>Do you intend it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  I marry her? What, a customer? Prithee bear</p>

<p>some charity to my wit! Do not think it so unwholesome.</p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  So, so, so, so. They laugh that wins.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Faith, the cry goes that you marry her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Prithee say true!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I am a very villain else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Have you scored me? Well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  This is the monkey’s own giving out. She is</p>

<p>persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and</p>

<p>flattery, not out of my promise.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Iago beckons me. Now he begins the story.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  She was here even now. She haunts me in</p>

<p>every place. I was the other day talking on the</p>

<p>sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes</p>

<p>the bauble. By this hand, she falls thus about my</p>

<p>neck!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Crying, “O dear Cassio,” as it were; his</p>

<p>gesture imports it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me, so</p>

<p>shakes and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Now he tells how she plucked him to my</p>

<p>chamber.–O, I see that nose of yours, but not that</p>

<p>dog I shall throw it to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Well, I must leave her company.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Before me, look where she comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bianca.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  ’Tis such another fitchew–marry, a perfumed</p>

<p>one!–What do you mean by this haunting</p>

<p>of me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bianca</sc>  Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did</p>

<p>you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me</p>

<p>even now? I was a fine fool to take it! I must take</p>

<p>out the work? A likely piece of work, that you</p>

<p>should find it in your chamber and know not who</p>

<p>left it there! This is some minx’s token, and I must</p>

<p>take out the work! There, give it your hobbyhorse.</p>

<p>Wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>How now, my sweet Bianca? How now? How now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Bianca</sc>  If you’ll come to supper tonight you may. If</p>

<p>you will not, come when you are next prepared</p>

<p>for.     <i><i>[She exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  After her, after her!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Faith, I must. She’ll rail in the streets else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Will you sup there?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Faith, I intend so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very</p>

<p>fain speak with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Prithee come. Will you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Go to; say no more.     <i><i>[Cassio exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc> <i>[coming forward]</i>  How shall I murder him,</p>

<p>Iago?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  O Iago!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  And did you see the handkerchief?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Was that mine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Yours, by this hand! And to see how he prizes</p>

<p>the foolish woman your wife! She gave it him, and</p>

<p>he hath giv’n it his whore.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I would have him nine years a-killing! A fine</p>

<p>woman, a fair woman, a sweet woman!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Nay, you must forget that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Ay, let her rot and perish and be damned</p>

<p>tonight, for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned</p>

<p>to stone. I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the</p>

<p>world hath not a sweeter creature! She might lie by</p>

<p>an emperor’s side and command him tasks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Nay, that’s not your way.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Hang her, I do but say what she is! So</p>

<p>delicate with her needle, an admirable musician–</p>

<p>O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear!</p>

<p>Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  She’s the worse for all this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  O, a thousand, a thousand times!–And then</p>

<p>of so gentle a condition!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Ay, too gentle.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Nay, that’s certain. But yet the pity of it,</p>

<p>Iago! O, Iago, the pity of it, Iago!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her</p>

<p>patent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes</p>

<p>near nobody.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I will chop her into messes! Cuckold me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  O, ’tis foul in her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  With mine officer!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  That’s fouler.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I’ll not</p>

<p>expostulate with her lest her body and beauty</p>

<p>unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Do it not with poison. Strangle her in her bed,</p>

<p>even the bed she hath contaminated.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Good, good. The justice of it pleases. Very</p>

<p>good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You</p>

<p>shall hear more by midnight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Excellent good.     <i><i>[A trumpet sounds.]</i></i></p>

<p>What trumpet is that same?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I warrant something from Venice.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lodovico, Desdemona, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>’Tis Lodovico. This comes from the Duke.</p>

<p>See, your wife’s with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc>  God save you, worthy general.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  With all my heart, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>The Duke and the Senators of Venice greet you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He hands Othello a paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>And what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>I am very glad to see you, signior.</p>

<p>Welcome to Cyprus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Lives, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Cousin, there’s fall’n between him and my lord</p>

<p>An unkind breach, but you shall make all well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Are you sure of that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  My lord?</p>

<p><sc>Othello</sc> <i>[reading]</i>  “This fail you not to do, as you</p>

<p>will”–</p>

<p>Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>A most unhappy one. I would do much</p>

<p>T’ atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.</p>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Are you wise?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>What, is he angry?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc>  May be the letter moved him.</p>

<p>For, as I think, they do command him home,</p>

<p>Deputing Cassio in his government.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  By my troth, I am glad on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Indeed?</p>

<p>Though I should swear I saw ’t. ’Tis very much.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  O, devil, devil!</p>

<p>monkeys!     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>Is this the noble Moor, whom our full senate</p>

<p>Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature</p>

<p>Whom passion could not shake, whose solid virtue</p>

<p>The shot of accident nor dart of chance</p>

<p>Could neither graze nor pierce?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  He is much</p>

<p>changed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>He’s that he is. I may not breathe my censure</p>

<p>What he might be. If what he might he is not,</p>

<p>I would to heaven he were.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc>  What? Strike his wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>’Faith, that was not so well. Yet would I knew</p>

<p>That stroke would prove the worst.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc>  Is it his use?</p>

<p>Or did the letters work upon his blood</p>

<p>And new-create this fault?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Alas, alas!</p>

<p>It is not honesty in me to speak</p>

<p>What I have seen and known. You shall observe</p>

<p>him,</p>

<p>And his own courses will denote him so</p>

<p>That I may save my speech. Do but go after</p>

<p>And mark how he continues.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lodovico</sc></p>

<p>I am sorry that I am deceived in him.</p>
