<p><center><i>[Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do</p>

<p>All my abilities in thy behalf.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband</p>

<p>As if the cause were his.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>O, that’s an honest fellow! Do not doubt, Cassio,</p>

<p>But I will have my lord and you again</p>

<p>As friendly as you were.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Bounteous madam,</p>

<p>Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,</p>

<p>He’s never anything but your true servant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>I know ’t. I thank you. You do love my lord;</p>

<p>You have known him long; and be you well assured</p>

<p>He shall in strangeness stand no farther off</p>

<p>Than in a politic distance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Ay, but, lady,</p>

<p>That policy may either last so long,</p>

<p>Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,</p>

<p>Or breed itself so out of circumstance,</p>

<p>That, I being absent and my place supplied,</p>

<p>My general will forget my love and service.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here,</p>

<p>I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,</p>

<p>If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it</p>

<p>To the last article. My lord shall never rest:</p>

<p>I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;</p>

<p>His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;</p>

<p>I’ll intermingle everything he does</p>

<p>With Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,</p>

<p>For thy solicitor shall rather die</p>

<p>Than give thy cause away.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Othello and Iago.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Madam, here comes my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc>  Madam, I’ll take my leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Why, stay, and hear me speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cassio</sc></p>

<p>Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease,</p>

<p>Unfit for mine own purposes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Well, do your discretion.     <i><i>[Cassio exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Ha, I like not that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  What dost thou say?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Nothing, my lord; or if–I know not what.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it</p>

<p>That he would steal away so guiltylike,</p>

<p>Seeing your coming.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I do believe ’twas he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  How now, my lord?</p>

<p>I have been talking with a suitor here,</p>

<p>A man that languishes in your displeasure.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Who is ’t you mean?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,</p>

<p>If I have any grace or power to move you,</p>

<p>His present reconciliation take;</p>

<p>For if he be not one that truly loves you,</p>

<p>That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,</p>

<p>I have no judgment in an honest face.</p>

<p>I prithee call him back.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Went he hence now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Yes, faith, so humbled</p>

<p>That he hath left part of his grief with me</p>

<p>To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Not now, sweet Desdemon. Some other time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>But shall ’t be shortly?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  The sooner, sweet, for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Shall ’t be tonight at supper?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  No, not tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Tomorrow dinner, then?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I shall not dine at home;</p>

<p>I meet the captains at the citadel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,</p>

<p>On Tuesday noon or night; on Wednesday morn.</p>

<p>I prithee name the time, but let it not</p>

<p>Exceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent;</p>

<p>And yet his trespass, in our common reason–</p>

<p>Save that, they say, the wars must make example</p>

<p>Out of her best–is not almost a fault</p>

<p>T’ incur a private check. When shall he come?</p>

<p>Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul</p>

<p>What you would ask me that I should deny,</p>

<p>Or stand so mamm’ring on? What? Michael Cassio,</p>

<p>That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,</p>

<p>When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,</p>

<p>Hath ta’en your part–to have so much to do</p>

<p>To bring him in! By ’r Lady, I could do much–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;</p>

<p>I will deny thee nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Why, this is not a boon!</p>

<p>’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,</p>

<p>Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,</p>

<p>Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit</p>

<p>To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit</p>

<p>Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,</p>

<p>It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,</p>

<p>And fearful to be granted.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I will deny thee nothing!</p>

<p>Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,</p>

<p>To leave me but a little to myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Farewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Emilia, come.–Be as your fancies teach you.</p>

<p>Whate’er you be, I am obedient.</p>

<p><center><i>[Desdemona and Emilia exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul</p>

<p>But I do love thee! And when I love thee not,</p>

<p>Chaos is come again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  My noble lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>What dost thou say, Iago?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Did Michael Cassio,</p>

<p>When you wooed my lady, know of your love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>But for a satisfaction of my thought,</p>

<p>No further harm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Why of thy thought, Iago?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>I did not think he had been acquainted with her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>O yes, and went between us very oft.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Indeed?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Indeed? Ay, indeed! Discern’st thou aught in that?</p>

<p>Is he not honest?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Honest, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Honest–ay, honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>My lord, for aught I know.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  What dost thou think?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Think, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>“Think, my lord?” By heaven, thou echo’st me</p>

<p>As if there were some monster in thy thought</p>

<p>Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean</p>

<p>something.</p>

<p>I heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,</p>

<p>When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?</p>

<p>And when I told thee he was of my counsel</p>

<p>In my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>And didst contract and purse thy brow together</p>

<p>As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</p>

<p>Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,</p>

<p>Show me thy thought.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  My lord, you know I love you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I think thou dost;</p>

<p>And for I know thou ’rt full of love and honesty</p>

<p>And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them</p>

<p>breath,</p>

<p>Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more.</p>

<p>For such things in a false, disloyal knave</p>

<p>Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,</p>

<p>They’re close dilations working from the heart</p>

<p>That passion cannot rule.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  For Michael Cassio,</p>

<p>I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>I think so too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Men should be what they seem;</p>

<p>Or those that be not, would they might seem none!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Certain, men should be what they seem.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Why then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Nay, yet there’s more in this.</p>

<p>I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,</p>

<p>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of</p>

<p>thoughts</p>

<p>The worst of words.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Good my lord, pardon me.</p>

<p>Though I am bound to every act of duty,</p>

<p>I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.</p>

<p>Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and</p>

<p>false–</p>

<p>As where’s that palace whereinto foul things</p>

<p>Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so</p>

<p>pure</p>

<p>But some uncleanly apprehensions</p>

<p>Keep leets and law days and in sessions sit</p>

<p>With meditations lawful?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,</p>

<p>If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear</p>

<p>A stranger to thy thoughts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I do beseech you,</p>

<p>Though I perchance am vicious in my guess–</p>

<p>As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague</p>

<p>To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy</p>

<p>Shapes faults that are not–that your wisdom</p>

<p>From one that so imperfectly conceits</p>

<p>Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble</p>

<p>Out of his scattering and unsure observance.</p>

<p>It were not for your quiet nor your good,</p>

<p>Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,</p>

<p>To let you know my thoughts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  What dost thou mean?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,</p>

<p>Is the immediate jewel of their souls.</p>

<p>Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something,</p>

<p>nothing;</p>

<p>’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to</p>

<p>thousands.</p>

<p>But he that filches from me my good name</p>

<p>Robs me of that which not enriches him</p>

<p>And makes me poor indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,</p>

<p>Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!</p>

<p>It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock</p>

<p>The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss</p>

<p>Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;</p>

<p>But O, what damned minutes tells he o’er</p>

<p>Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  O misery!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;</p>

<p>But riches fineless is as poor as winter</p>

<p>To him that ever fears he shall be poor.</p>

<p>Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend</p>

<p>From jealousy!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Why, why is this?</p>

<p>Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,</p>

<p>To follow still the changes of the moon</p>

<p>With fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt</p>

<p>Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat</p>

<p>When I shall turn the business of my soul</p>

<p>To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,</p>

<p>Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous</p>

<p>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</p>

<p>Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well.</p>

<p>Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.</p>

<p>Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw</p>

<p>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,</p>

<p>For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,</p>

<p>I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</p>

<p>And on the proof, there is no more but this:</p>

<p>Away at once with love or jealousy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason</p>

<p>To show the love and duty that I bear you</p>

<p>With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,</p>

<p>Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</p>

<p>Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;</p>

<p>Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.</p>

<p>I would not have your free and noble nature,</p>

<p>Out of self-bounty, be abused. Look to ’t.</p>

<p>I know our country disposition well.</p>

<p>In Venice they do let God see the pranks</p>

<p>They dare not show their husbands. Their best</p>

<p>conscience</p>

<p>Is not to leave ’t undone, but keep ’t unknown.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Dost thou say so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>She did deceive her father, marrying you,</p>

<p>And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,</p>

<p>She loved them most.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  And so she did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Why, go to, then!</p>

<p>She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,</p>

<p>To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak,</p>

<p>He thought ’twas witchcraft! But I am much to</p>

<p>blame.</p>

<p>I humbly do beseech you of your pardon</p>

<p>For too much loving you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I am bound to thee forever.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Not a jot, not a jot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I’ faith, I fear it has.</p>

<p>I hope you will consider what is spoke</p>

<p>Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved.</p>

<p>I am to pray you not to strain my speech</p>

<p>To grosser issues nor to larger reach</p>

<p>Than to suspicion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I will not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Should you do so, my lord,</p>

<p>My speech should fall into such vile success</p>

<p>As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio’s my worthy</p>

<p>friend.</p>

<p>My lord, I see you’re moved.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  No, not much moved.</p>

<p>I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Long live she so! And long live you to think so!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>And yet, how nature erring from itself–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you,</p>

<p>Not to affect many proposed matches</p>

<p>Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,</p>

<p>Whereto we see in all things nature tends–</p>

<p>Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank,</p>

<p>Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural–</p>

<p>But pardon me–I do not in position</p>

<p>Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear</p>

<p>Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,</p>

<p>May fall to match you with her country forms</p>

<p>And happily repent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Farewell, farewell!</p>

<p>If more thou dost perceive, let me know more.</p>

<p>Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc> <i>[beginning to exit]</i>  My lord, I take my leave.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless</p>

<p>Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc> <i>[returning]</i></p>

<p>My lord, I would I might entreat your Honor</p>

<p>To scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time.</p>

<p>Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place–</p>

<p>For sure he fills it up with great ability–</p>

<p>Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,</p>

<p>You shall by that perceive him and his means.</p>

<p>Note if your lady strain his entertainment</p>

<p>With any strong or vehement importunity.</p>

<p>Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,</p>

<p>Let me be thought too busy in my fears–</p>

<p>As worthy cause I have to fear I am–</p>

<p>And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Fear not my government.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I once more take my leave.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,</p>

<p>And knows all qualities with a learned spirit</p>

<p>Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,</p>

<p>Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,</p>

<p>I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind</p>

<p>To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black</p>

<p>And have not those soft parts of conversation</p>

<p>That chamberers have, or for I am declined</p>

<p>Into the vale of years–yet that’s not much–</p>

<p>She’s gone, I am abused, and my relief</p>

<p>Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,</p>

<p>That we can call these delicate creatures ours</p>

<p>And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad</p>

<p>And live upon the vapor of a dungeon</p>

<p>Than keep a corner in the thing I love</p>

<p>For others’ uses. Yet ’tis the plague of great ones;</p>

<p>Prerogatived are they less than the base.</p>

<p>’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.</p>

<p>Even then this forked plague is fated to us</p>

<p>When we do quicken. Look where she comes.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Desdemona and Emilia.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>If she be false, heaven mocks itself!</p>

<p>I’ll not believe ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  How now, my dear Othello?</p>

<p>Your dinner, and the generous islanders</p>

<p>By you invited, do attend your presence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I am to blame.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Why do you speak so faintly? Are you not well?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>I have a pain upon my forehead, here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>Faith, that’s with watching. ’Twill away again.</p>

<p>Let me but bind it hard; within this hour</p>

<p>It will be well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Your napkin is too little.</p>

<p>Let it alone.     <i><i>[The handkerchief falls, unnoticed.]</i></i></p>

<p>Come, I’ll go in with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>I am very sorry that you are not well.</p>

<p><center><i>[Othello and Desdemona exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc> <i>[picking up the handkerchief]</i></p>

<p>I am glad I have found this napkin.</p>

<p>This was her first remembrance from the Moor.</p>

<p>My wayward husband hath a hundred times</p>

<p>Wooed me to steal it. But she so loves the token</p>

<p>(For he conjured her she should ever keep it)</p>

<p>That she reserves it evermore about her</p>

<p>To kiss and talk to. I’ll have the work ta’en out</p>

<p>And give ’t Iago. What he will do with it</p>

<p>Heaven knows, not I.</p>

<p>I nothing but to please his fantasy.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Iago.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  How now? What do you here alone?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>Do not you chide. I have a thing for you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>You have a thing for me? It is a common thing–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  Ha?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  To have a foolish wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>O, is that all? What will you give me now</p>

<p>For that same handkerchief?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  What handkerchief?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc>  What handkerchief?</p>

<p>Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,</p>

<p>That which so often you did bid me steal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Hast stol’n it from her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>No, faith, she let it drop by negligence,</p>

<p>And to th’ advantage I, being here, took ’t up.</p>

<p>Look, here ’tis.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  A good wench! Give it me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>What will you do with ’t, that you have been so</p>

<p>earnest</p>

<p>To have me filch it?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc> <i>[snatching it]</i>  Why, what is that to you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Emilia</sc></p>

<p>If it be not for some purpose of import,</p>

<p>Give ’t me again. Poor lady, she’ll run mad</p>

<p>When she shall lack it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Be not acknown on ’t.</p>

<p>I have use for it. Go, leave me.     <i><i>[Emilia exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin</p>

<p>And let him find it. Trifles light as air</p>

<p>Are to the jealous confirmations strong</p>

<p>As proofs of holy writ. This may do something.</p>

<p>The Moor already changes with my poison;</p>

<p>Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,</p>

<p>Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,</p>

<p>But with a little act upon the blood</p>

<p>Burn like the mines of sulfur.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Othello.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>I did say so.</p>

<p>Look where he comes. Not poppy nor mandragora</p>

<p>Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world</p>

<p>Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep</p>

<p>Which thou owedst yesterday.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Ha, ha, false to me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Why, how now, general? No more of that!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Avaunt! Begone! Thou hast set me on the rack.</p>

<p>I swear ’tis better to be much abused</p>

<p>Than but to know ’t a little.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  How now, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?</p>

<p>I saw ’t not, thought it not; it harmed not me.</p>

<p>I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and</p>

<p>merry.</p>

<p>I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.</p>

<p>He that is robbed, not wanting what is stol’n,</p>

<p>Let him not know ’t, and he’s not robbed at all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I am sorry to hear this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>I had been happy if the general camp,</p>

<p>Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,</p>

<p>So I had nothing known. O, now, forever</p>

<p>Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!</p>

<p>Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars</p>

<p>That makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!</p>

<p>Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,</p>

<p>The spirit-stirring drum, th’ ear-piercing fife,</p>

<p>The royal banner, and all quality,</p>

<p>Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!</p>

<p>And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats</p>

<p>Th’ immortal Jove’s dread clamors counterfeit,</p>

<p>Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Is ’t possible, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore!</p>

<p>Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,</p>

<p>Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul,</p>

<p>Thou hadst been better have been born a dog</p>

<p>Than answer my waked wrath.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Is ’t come to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it</p>

<p>That the probation bear no hinge nor loop</p>

<p>To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  My noble lord–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>If thou dost slander her and torture me,</p>

<p>Never pray more. Abandon all remorse;</p>

<p>On horror’s head horrors accumulate;</p>

<p>Do deeds to make heaven weep, all Earth amazed;</p>

<p>For nothing canst thou to damnation add</p>

<p>Greater than that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  O grace! O heaven forgive me!</p>

<p>Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense?</p>

<p>God b’ wi’ you. Take mine office.–O wretched fool,</p>

<p>That liv’st to make thine honesty a vice!–</p>

<p>O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world:</p>

<p>To be direct and honest is not safe.–</p>

<p>I thank you for this profit, and from hence</p>

<p>I’ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offense.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>I should be wise; for honesty’s a fool</p>

<p>And loses that it works for.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  By the world,</p>

<p>I think my wife be honest and think she is not.</p>

<p>I think that thou art just and think thou art not.</p>

<p>I’ll have some proof! Her name, that was as fresh</p>

<p>As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black</p>

<p>As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,</p>

<p>Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,</p>

<p>I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>I see you are eaten up with passion.</p>

<p>I do repent me that I put it to you.</p>

<p>You would be satisfied?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Would? Nay, and I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>And may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?</p>

<p>Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on,</p>

<p>Behold her topped?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Death and damnation! O!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>It were a tedious difficulty, I think,</p>

<p>To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then</p>

<p>If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster</p>

<p>More than their own! What then? How then?</p>

<p>What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction?</p>

<p>It is impossible you should see this,</p>

<p>Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,</p>

<p>As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross</p>

<p>As ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,</p>

<p>If imputation and strong circumstances</p>

<p>Which lead directly to the door of truth</p>

<p>Will give you satisfaction, you might have ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I do not like the office,</p>

<p>But sith I am entered in this cause so far,</p>

<p>Pricked to ’t by foolish honesty and love,</p>

<p>I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,</p>

<p>And being troubled with a raging tooth</p>

<p>I could not sleep. There are a kind of men</p>

<p>So loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter</p>

<p>Their affairs. One of this kind is Cassio.</p>

<p>In sleep I heard him say “Sweet Desdemona,</p>

<p>Let us be wary, let us hide our loves.”</p>

<p>And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,</p>

<p>Cry “O sweet creature!” then kiss me hard,</p>

<p>As if he plucked up kisses by the roots</p>

<p>That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg</p>

<p>O’er my thigh, and sighed, and kissed, and then</p>

<p>Cried “Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>O monstrous! Monstrous!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Nay, this was but his</p>

<p>dream.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>But this denoted a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>And this may help to thicken other proofs</p>

<p>That do demonstrate thinly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I’ll tear her all to pieces.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Nay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done.</p>

<p>She may be honest yet. Tell me but this:</p>

<p>Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief</p>

<p>Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>I gave her such a one. ’Twas my first gift.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>I know not that; but such a handkerchief–</p>

<p>I am sure it was your wife’s–did I today</p>

<p>See Cassio wipe his beard with.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  If it be that–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>If it be that, or any that was hers,</p>

<p>It speaks against her with the other proofs.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!</p>

<p>One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.</p>

<p>Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago,</p>

<p>All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.</p>

<p>’Tis gone.</p>

<p>Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!</p>

<p>Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne</p>

<p>To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,</p>

<p>For ’tis of aspics’ tongues!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Yet be content.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  O, blood, blood, blood!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Patience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,</p>

<p>Whose icy current and compulsive course</p>

<p>Ne’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on</p>

<p>To the Propontic and the Hellespont,</p>

<p>Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace</p>

<p>Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,</p>

<p>Till that a capable and wide revenge</p>

<p>Swallow them up. <i>[He kneels.]</i> Now by yond marble</p>

<p>heaven,</p>

<p>In the due reverence of a sacred vow,</p>

<p>I here engage my words.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Do not rise yet.     <i><i>[Iago kneels.]</i></i></p>

<p>Witness, you ever-burning lights above,</p>

<p>You elements that clip us round about,</p>

<p>Witness that here Iago doth give up</p>

<p>The execution of his wit, hands, heart</p>

<p>To wronged Othello’s service! Let him command,</p>

<p>And to obey shall be in me remorse,</p>

<p>What bloody business ever.     <i><i>[They rise.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I greet thy love</p>

<p>Not with vain thanks but with acceptance</p>

<p>bounteous,</p>

<p>And will upon the instant put thee to ’t.</p>

<p>Within these three days let me hear thee say</p>

<p>That Cassio’s not alive.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  My friend is dead.</p>

<p>’Tis done at your request. But let her live.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn</p>

<p>her!</p>

<p>Come, go with me apart. I will withdraw</p>

<p>To furnish me with some swift means of death</p>

<p>For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  I am your own forever.</p>
