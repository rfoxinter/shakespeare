<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[reading a paper]</i></p>

<p>There’s no composition in these news</p>

<p>That gives them credit.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc> <i>[reading a paper]</i></p>

<p>Indeed, they are disproportioned.</p>

<p>My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>And mine, a hundred forty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Senator</sc> <i>[reading a paper]</i></p>

<p>And mine, two hundred.</p>

<p>But though they jump not on a just account</p>

<p>(As in these cases, where the aim reports</p>

<p>’Tis oft with difference), yet do they all confirm</p>

<p>A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Nay, it is possible enough to judgment.</p>

<p>I do not so secure me in the error,</p>

<p>But the main article I do approve</p>

<p>In fearful sense.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sailor</sc> <i>[within]</i>  What ho, what ho, what ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Sailor.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Officer</sc>  A messenger from the galleys.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Now, what’s the business?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Sailor</sc></p>

<p>The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes.</p>

<p>So was I bid report here to the state</p>

<p>By Signior Angelo.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>How say you by this change?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  This cannot be,</p>

<p>By no assay of reason. ’Tis a pageant</p>

<p>To keep us in false gaze. When we consider</p>

<p>Th’ importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,</p>

<p>And let ourselves again but understand</p>

<p>That, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,</p>

<p>So may he with more facile question bear it,</p>

<p>For that it stands not in such warlike brace,</p>

<p>But altogether lacks th’ abilities</p>

<p>That Rhodes is dressed in–if we make thought of</p>

<p>this,</p>

<p>We must not think the Turk is so unskillful</p>

<p>To leave that latest which concerns him first,</p>

<p>Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain</p>

<p>To wake and wage a danger profitless.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Nay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Officer</sc>  Here is more news.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>The Ottomites, Reverend and Gracious,</p>

<p>Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,</p>

<p>Have there injointed them with an after fleet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc></p>

<p>Of thirty sail; and now they do restem</p>

<p>Their backward course, bearing with frank</p>

<p>appearance</p>

<p>Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,</p>

<p>Your trusty and most valiant servitor,</p>

<p>With his free duty recommends you thus,</p>

<p>And prays you to believe him.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  ’Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.</p>

<p>Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>He’s now in Florence.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Write from us to him.</p>

<p>Post-post-haste. Dispatch.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Roderigo, and</p>

<p>Officers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you</p>

<p>Against the general enemy Ottoman.</p>

<p><i>[To Brabantio.]</i> I did not see you. Welcome, gentle</p>

<p>signior.</p>

<p>We lacked your counsel and your help tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brabantio</sc></p>

<p>So did I yours. Good your Grace, pardon me.</p>

<p>Neither my place nor aught I heard of business</p>

<p>Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general</p>

<p>care</p>

<p>Take hold on me, for my particular grief</p>

<p>Is of so floodgate and o’erbearing nature</p>

<p>That it engluts and swallows other sorrows</p>

<p>And it is still itself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Why, what’s the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brabantio</sc></p>

<p>My daughter! O, my daughter!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  Dead?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brabantio</sc>  Ay, to me.</p>

<p>She is abused, stol’n from me, and corrupted</p>

<p>By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;</p>

<p>For nature so prepost’rously to err–</p>

<p>Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense–</p>

<p>Sans witchcraft could not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Whoe’er he be that in this foul proceeding</p>

<p>Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself</p>

<p>And you of her, the bloody book of law</p>

<p>You shall yourself read in the bitter letter,</p>

<p>After your own sense, yea, though our proper son</p>

<p>Stood in your action.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brabantio</sc>  Humbly I thank your Grace.</p>

<p>Here is the man–this Moor, whom now it seems</p>

<p>Your special mandate for the state affairs</p>

<p>Hath hither brought.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>All</sc>  We are very sorry for ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc> <i>[to Othello]</i></p>

<p>What, in your own part, can you say to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brabantio</sc>  Nothing, but this is so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,</p>

<p>My very noble and approved good masters:</p>

<p>That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,</p>

<p>It is most true; true I have married her.</p>

<p>The very head and front of my offending</p>

<p>Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</p>

<p>And little blessed with the soft phrase of peace;</p>

<p>For since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith,</p>

<p>Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used</p>

<p>Their dearest action in the tented field,</p>

<p>And little of this great world can I speak</p>

<p>More than pertains to feats of broil and battle.</p>

<p>And therefore little shall I grace my cause</p>

<p>In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious</p>

<p>patience,</p>

<p>I will a round unvarnished tale deliver</p>

<p>Of my whole course of love–what drugs, what</p>

<p>charms,</p>

<p>What conjuration, and what mighty magic</p>

<p>(For such proceeding I am charged withal)</p>

<p>I won his daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brabantio</sc>  A maiden never bold,</p>

<p>Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion</p>

<p>Blushed at herself. And she, in spite of nature,</p>

<p>Of years, of country, credit, everything,</p>

<p>To fall in love with what she feared to look on!</p>

<p>It is a judgment maimed and most imperfect</p>

<p>That will confess perfection so could err</p>

<p>Against all rules of nature, and must be driven</p>

<p>To find out practices of cunning hell</p>

<p>Why this should be. I therefore vouch again</p>

<p>That with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood,</p>

<p>Or with some dram conjured to this effect,</p>

<p>He wrought upon her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  To vouch this is no proof</p>

<p>Without more wider and more overt test</p>

<p>Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods</p>

<p>Of modern seeming do prefer against him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc>  But, Othello, speak:</p>

<p>Did you by indirect and forced courses</p>

<p>Subdue and poison this young maid’s affections?</p>

<p>Or came it by request, and such fair question</p>

<p>As soul to soul affordeth?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  I do beseech you,</p>

<p>Send for the lady to the Sagittary</p>

<p>And let her speak of me before her father.</p>

<p>If you do find me foul in her report,</p>

<p>The trust, the office I do hold of you,</p>

<p>Not only take away, but let your sentence</p>

<p>Even fall upon my life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Fetch Desdemona hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Ancient, conduct them. You best know the place.</p>

<p><center><i>[Iago and Attendants exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>And till she come, as truly as to heaven</p>

<p>I do confess the vices of my blood,</p>

<p>So justly to your grave ears I’ll present</p>

<p>How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love,</p>

<p>And she in mine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Say it, Othello.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>Her father loved me, oft invited me,</p>

<p>Still questioned me the story of my life</p>

<p>From year to year–the battles, sieges, fortunes</p>

<p>That I have passed.</p>

<p>I ran it through, even from my boyish days</p>

<p>To th’ very moment that he bade me tell it,</p>

<p>Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:</p>

<p>Of moving accidents by flood and field,</p>

<p>Of hairbreadth ’scapes i’ th’ imminent deadly</p>

<p>breach,</p>

<p>Of being taken by the insolent foe</p>

<p>And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,</p>

<p>And portance in my traveler’s history,</p>

<p>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,</p>

<p>Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads</p>

<p>touch heaven,</p>

<p>It was my hint to speak–such was my process–</p>

<p>And of the cannibals that each other eat,</p>

<p>The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads</p>

<p>Do grow beneath their shoulders. These things to</p>

<p>hear</p>

<p>Would Desdemona seriously incline.</p>

<p>But still the house affairs would draw her thence,</p>

<p>Which ever as she could with haste dispatch</p>

<p>She’d come again, and with a greedy ear</p>

<p>Devour up my discourse. Which I, observing,</p>

<p>Took once a pliant hour, and found good means</p>

<p>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</p>

<p>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</p>

<p>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</p>

<p>But not intentively. I did consent,</p>

<p>And often did beguile her of her tears</p>

<p>When I did speak of some distressful stroke</p>

<p>That my youth suffered. My story being done,</p>

<p>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs.</p>

<p>She swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing</p>

<p>strange,</p>

<p>’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.</p>

<p>She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished</p>

<p>That heaven had made her such a man. She thanked</p>

<p>me,</p>

<p>And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,</p>

<p>I should but teach him how to tell my story,</p>

<p>And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake.</p>

<p>She loved me for the dangers I had passed,</p>

<p>And I loved her that she did pity them.</p>

<p>This only is the witchcraft I have used.</p>

<p>Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>I think this tale would win my daughter, too.</p>

<p>Good Brabantio,</p>

<p>Take up this mangled matter at the best.</p>

<p>Men do their broken weapons rather use</p>

<p>Than their bare hands.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brabantio</sc>  I pray you hear her speak.</p>

<p>If she confess that she was half the wooer,</p>

<p>Destruction on my head if my bad blame</p>

<p>Light on the man.–Come hither, gentle mistress.</p>

<p>Do you perceive in all this noble company</p>

<p>Where most you owe obedience?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  My noble father,</p>

<p>I do perceive here a divided duty.</p>

<p>To you I am bound for life and education.</p>

<p>My life and education both do learn me</p>

<p>How to respect you. You are the lord of duty.</p>

<p>I am hitherto your daughter. But here’s my</p>

<p>husband.</p>

<p>And so much duty as my mother showed</p>

<p>To you, preferring you before her father,</p>

<p>So much I challenge that I may profess</p>

<p>Due to the Moor my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brabantio</sc>  God be with you! I have done.</p>

<p>Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs.</p>

<p>I had rather to adopt a child than get it.–</p>

<p>Come hither, Moor.</p>

<p>I here do give thee that with all my heart</p>

<p>Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart</p>

<p>I would keep from thee.–For your sake, jewel,</p>

<p>I am glad at soul I have no other child,</p>

<p>For thy escape would teach me tyranny,</p>

<p>To hang clogs on them.–I have done, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence,</p>

<p>Which as a grise or step may help these lovers</p>

<p>Into your favor.</p>

<p>When remedies are past, the griefs are ended</p>

<p>By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.</p>

<p>To mourn a mischief that is past and gone</p>

<p>Is the next way to draw new mischief on.</p>

<p>What cannot be preserved when fortune takes,</p>

<p>Patience her injury a mock’ry makes.</p>

<p>The robbed that smiles steals something from the</p>

<p>thief;</p>

<p>He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brabantio</sc></p>

<p>So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,</p>

<p>We lose it not so long as we can smile.</p>

<p>He bears the sentence well that nothing bears</p>

<p>But the free comfort which from thence he hears;</p>

<p>But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow</p>

<p>That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.</p>

<p>These sentences to sugar or to gall,</p>

<p>Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.</p>

<p>But words are words. I never yet did hear</p>

<p>That the bruised heart was pierced through the</p>

<p>ear.</p>

<p>I humbly beseech you, proceed to th’ affairs of</p>

<p>state.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes</p>

<p>for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is</p>

<p>best known to you. And though we have there a</p>

<p>substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a</p>

<p>sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer</p>

<p>voice on you. You must therefore be content to</p>

<p>slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this</p>

<p>more stubborn and boist’rous expedition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>The tyrant custom, most grave senators,</p>

<p>Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war</p>

<p>My thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize</p>

<p>A natural and prompt alacrity</p>

<p>I find in hardness, and do undertake</p>

<p>This present wars against the Ottomites.</p>

<p>Most humbly, therefore, bending to your state,</p>

<p>I crave fit disposition for my wife,</p>

<p>Due reference of place and exhibition,</p>

<p>With such accommodation and besort</p>

<p>As levels with her breeding.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Why, at her father’s.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brabantio</sc>  I will not have it so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Nor I.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc>  Nor would I there reside</p>

<p>To put my father in impatient thoughts</p>

<p>By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,</p>

<p>To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear</p>

<p>And let me find a charter in your voice</p>

<p>T’ assist my simpleness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  What would you, Desdemona?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Desdemona</sc></p>

<p>That I love the Moor to live with him</p>

<p>My downright violence and storm of fortunes</p>

<p>May trumpet to the world. My heart’s subdued</p>

<p>Even to the very quality of my lord.</p>

<p>I saw Othello’s visage in his mind,</p>

<p>And to his honors and his valiant parts</p>

<p>Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.</p>

<p>So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,</p>

<p>A moth of peace, and he go to the war,</p>

<p>The rites for why I love him are bereft me</p>

<p>And I a heavy interim shall support</p>

<p>By his dear absence. Let me go with him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  Let her have your voice.</p>

<p>Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not</p>

<p>To please the palate of my appetite,</p>

<p>Nor to comply with heat (the young affects</p>

<p>In me defunct) and proper satisfaction,</p>

<p>But to be free and bounteous to her mind.</p>

<p>And heaven defend your good souls that you think</p>

<p>I will your serious and great business scant</p>

<p>For she is with me. No, when light-winged toys</p>

<p>Of feathered Cupid seel with wanton dullness</p>

<p>My speculative and officed instruments,</p>

<p>That my disports corrupt and taint my business,</p>

<p>Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,</p>

<p>And all indign and base adversities</p>

<p>Make head against my estimation.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>Be it as you shall privately determine,</p>

<p>Either for her stay or going. Th’ affair cries haste,</p>

<p>And speed must answer it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>You must away tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  With all my</p>

<p>heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc></p>

<p>At nine i’ th’ morning here we’ll meet again.</p>

<p>Othello, leave some officer behind</p>

<p>And he shall our commission bring to you,</p>

<p>With such things else of quality and respect</p>

<p>As doth import you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc>  So please your Grace, my</p>

<p>ancient.</p>

<p>A man he is of honesty and trust.</p>

<p>To his conveyance I assign my wife,</p>

<p>With what else needful your good Grace shall think</p>

<p>To be sent after me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Duke</sc>  Let it be so.</p>

<p>Good night to everyone. <i>[To Brabantio.]</i> And, noble</p>

<p>signior,</p>

<p>If virtue no delighted beauty lack,</p>

<p>Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Senator</sc></p>

<p>Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Brabantio</sc></p>

<p>Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see.</p>

<p>She has deceived her father, and may thee.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Othello</sc></p>

<p>My life upon her faith!</p>

<p><center><i>[The Duke, the Senators, Cassio, and Officers exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Honest Iago,</p>

<p>My Desdemona must I leave to thee.</p>

<p>I prithee let thy wife attend on her,</p>

<p>And bring them after in the best advantage.–</p>

<p>Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour</p>

<p>Of love, of worldly matters, and direction</p>

<p>To spend with thee. We must obey the time.</p>

<p><center><i>[Othello and Desdemona exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  Iago–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  What sayst thou, noble heart?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  What will I do, think’st thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Why, go to bed and sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  I will incontinently drown myself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,</p>

<p>thou silly gentleman!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  It is silliness to live, when to live is torment,</p>

<p>and then have we a prescription to die when death is</p>

<p>our physician.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  O, villainous! I have looked upon the world for</p>

<p>four times seven years, and since I could distinguish</p>

<p>betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found</p>

<p>man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say</p>

<p>I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I</p>

<p>would change my humanity with a baboon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  What should I do? I confess it is my shame</p>

<p>to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Virtue? A fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or</p>

<p>thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our</p>

<p>wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles</p>

<p>or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme,</p>

<p>supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it</p>

<p>with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or</p>

<p>manured with industry, why the power and corrigible</p>

<p>authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance</p>

<p>of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise</p>

<p>another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our</p>

<p>natures would conduct us to most prepost’rous</p>

<p>conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging</p>

<p>motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts–</p>

<p>whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect, or</p>

<p>scion.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  It cannot be.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission</p>

<p>of the will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown</p>

<p>cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy</p>

<p>friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving</p>

<p>with cables of perdurable toughness. I could never</p>

<p>better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse.</p>

<p>Follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an</p>

<p>usurped beard. I say, put money in thy purse. It</p>

<p>cannot be that Desdemona should long continue</p>

<p>her love to the Moor–put money in thy purse–</p>

<p>nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in</p>

<p>her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration</p>

<p>–put but money in thy purse. These Moors are</p>

<p>changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money.</p>

<p>The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts</p>

<p>shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.</p>

<p>She must change for youth. When she is sated</p>

<p>with his body she will find the error of her choice.</p>

<p>Therefore, put money in thy purse. If thou wilt</p>

<p>needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than</p>

<p>drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony</p>

<p>and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian</p>

<p>and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my</p>

<p>wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her.</p>

<p>Therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself!</p>

<p>It is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be</p>

<p>hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned</p>

<p>and go without her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on</p>

<p>the issue?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Thou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have</p>

<p>told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I</p>

<p>hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no</p>

<p>less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge</p>

<p>against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost</p>

<p>thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many</p>

<p>events in the womb of time which will be delivered.</p>

<p>Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more</p>

<p>of this tomorrow. Adieu.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  Where shall we meet i’ th’ morning?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  At my lodging.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  I’ll be with thee betimes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  What say you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  No more of drowning, do you hear?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  I am changed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc>  Go to, farewell. Put money enough in your</p>

<p>purse.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Roderigo</sc>  I’ll sell all my land.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Iago</sc></p>

<p>Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.</p>

<p>For I mine own gained knowledge should profane</p>

<p>If I would time expend with such a snipe</p>

<p>But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,</p>

<p>And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets</p>

<p>’Has done my office. I know not if ’t be true,</p>

<p>But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,</p>

<p>Will do as if for surety. He holds me well.</p>

<p>The better shall my purpose work on him.</p>

<p>Cassio’s a proper man. Let me see now:</p>

<p>To get his place and to plume up my will</p>

<p>In double knavery–How? how?–Let’s see.</p>

<p>After some time, to abuse Othello’s ear</p>

<p>That he is too familiar with his wife.</p>

<p>He hath a person and a smooth dispose</p>

<p>To be suspected, framed to make women false.</p>

<p>The Moor is of a free and open nature</p>

<p>That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,</p>

<p>And will as tenderly be led by th’ nose</p>

<p>As asses are.</p>

<p>I have ’t. It is engendered. Hell and night</p>

<p>Must bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light.</p>
