<p><center><i>[Enter Cornwall, Regan, Goneril, Edmund, the Bastard,</p>

<p>and Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc> <i>[to Goneril]</i>  Post speedily to my lord your</p>

<p>husband. Show him this letter. <i>[He gives her a</p>

<p>paper.]</i> The army of France is landed.–Seek out</p>

<p>the traitor Gloucester.     <i><i>[Some Servants exit.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  Hang him instantly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  Pluck out his eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  Leave him to my displeasure.–Edmund,</p>

<p>keep you our sister company. The revenges we are</p>

<p>bound to take upon your traitorous father are not</p>

<p>fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke, where you</p>

<p>are going, to a most festinate preparation; we are</p>

<p>bound to the like. Our posts shall be swift and</p>

<p>intelligent betwixt us.–Farewell, dear sister.–</p>

<p>Farewell, my lord of Gloucester.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Oswald, the Steward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now? Where’s the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oswald</sc></p>

<p>My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence.</p>

<p>Some five- or six-and-thirty of his knights,</p>

<p>Hot questrists after him, met him at gate,</p>

<p>Who, with some other of the lord’s dependents,</p>

<p>Are gone with him toward Dover, where they boast</p>

<p>To have well-armed friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  Get horses for your mistress.</p>

<p><center><i>[Oswald exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>Edmund, farewell.     <i><i>[Goneril and Edmund exit.]</i></i></p>

<p>Go seek the traitor Gloucester.</p>

<p>Pinion him like a thief; bring him before us.</p>

<p><center><i>[Some Servants exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Though well we may not pass upon his life</p>

<p>Without the form of justice, yet our power</p>

<p>Shall do a court’sy to our wrath, which men</p>

<p>May blame but not control.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gloucester and Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Who’s there? The</p>

<p>traitor?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  Ingrateful fox! ’Tis he.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  Bind fast his corky arms.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>What means your Graces? Good my friends,</p>

<p>consider</p>

<p>You are my guests; do me no foul play, friends.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>Bind him, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Unmerciful lady as you are, I’m none.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>To this chair bind him.     <i><i>[Servants bind Gloucester.]</i></i></p>

<p>Villain, thou shalt find–</p>

<p><center><i>[Regan plucks Gloucester’s beard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done</p>

<p>To pluck me by the beard.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>So white, and such a traitor?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Naughty lady,</p>

<p>These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin</p>

<p>Will quicken and accuse thee. I am your host;</p>

<p>With robber’s hands my hospitable favors</p>

<p>You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>Be simple-answered, for we know the truth.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>And what confederacy have you with the traitors</p>

<p>Late footed in the kingdom?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  To whose hands</p>

<p>You have sent the lunatic king. Speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>I have a letter guessingly set down</p>

<p>Which came from one that’s of a neutral heart,</p>

<p>And not from one opposed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  Cunning.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  And false.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  Where hast thou sent the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  To Dover.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at</p>

<p>peril–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>Wherefore to Dover? Let him answer that.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>I am tied to th’ stake, and I must stand the course.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  Wherefore to Dover?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Because I would not see thy cruel nails</p>

<p>Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister</p>

<p>In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.</p>

<p>The sea, with such a storm as his bare head</p>

<p>In hell-black night endured, would have buoyed up</p>

<p>And quenched the stelled fires;</p>

<p>Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.</p>

<p>If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time,</p>

<p>Thou shouldst have said “Good porter, turn the</p>

<p>key.”</p>

<p>All cruels else subscribe. But I shall see</p>

<p>The winged vengeance overtake such children.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>See ’t shalt thou never.–Fellows, hold the chair.–</p>

<p>Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>He that will think to live till he be old,</p>

<p>Give me some help!</p>

<p><center><i>[As Servants hold the chair, Cornwall forces out</p>

<p>one of Gloucester’s eyes.]</i></center></p>

<p>O cruel! O you gods!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>One side will mock another. Th’ other too.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>If you see vengeance–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servant</sc>  Hold your hand,</p>

<p>my lord.</p>

<p>I have served you ever since I was a child,</p>

<p>But better service have I never done you</p>

<p>Than now to bid you hold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  How now, you dog?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>If you did wear a beard upon your chin,</p>

<p>I’d shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  My villain?     <i><i>[Draw and fight.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc> <i>[to an Attendant]</i></p>

<p>Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?</p>

<p><center><i>[She takes a sword and runs</p>

<p>at him behind; kills him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>First</sc> <sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left</p>

<p>To see some mischief on him. O!     <i><i>[He dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!</p>

<p><center><i>[Forcing out Gloucester’s other eye.]</i></center></p>

<p>Where is thy luster now?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>All dark and comfortless! Where’s my son</p>

<p>Edmund?–</p>

<p>Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature</p>

<p>To quit this horrid act.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  Out, treacherous villain!</p>

<p>Thou call’st on him that hates thee. It was he</p>

<p>That made the overture of thy treasons to us,</p>

<p>Who is too good to pity thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>O my follies! Then Edgar was abused.</p>

<p>Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell</p>

<p>His way to Dover.</p>

<p><center><i>[Some Servants exit with Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<p>How is ’t, my lord? How look you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>I have received a hurt. Follow me, lady.–</p>

<p>Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave</p>

<p>Upon the dunghill.–Regan, I bleed apace.</p>

<p>Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.</p>

<p><center><i>[Cornwall and Regan exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>I’ll never care what wickedness I do</p>

<p>If this man come to good.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Servant</sc>  If she live long</p>

<p>And in the end meet the old course of death,</p>

<p>Women will all turn monsters.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Second</sc> <sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>Let’s follow the old earl and get the Bedlam</p>

<p>To lead him where he would. His roguish madness</p>

<p>Allows itself to anything.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Third</sc> <sc>Servant</sc></p>

<p>Go thou. I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs</p>

<p>To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
