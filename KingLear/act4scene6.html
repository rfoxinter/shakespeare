<p><center><i>[Enter Gloucester and Edgar dressed as a peasant.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>When shall I come to th’ top of that same hill?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>You do climb up it now. Look how we labor.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Methinks the ground is even.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Horrible steep.</p>

<p>Hark, do you hear the sea?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  No, truly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>Why then, your other senses grow imperfect</p>

<p>By your eyes’ anguish.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  So may it be indeed.</p>

<p>Methinks thy voice is altered and thou speak’st</p>

<p>In better phrase and matter than thou didst.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>You’re much deceived; in nothing am I changed</p>

<p>But in my garments.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Methinks you’re better spoken.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>Come on, sir. Here’s the place. Stand still. How</p>

<p>fearful</p>

<p>And dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!</p>

<p>The crows and choughs that wing the midway air</p>

<p>Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down</p>

<p>Hangs one that gathers samphire–dreadful trade;</p>

<p>Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.</p>

<p>The fishermen that walk upon the beach</p>

<p>Appear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark</p>

<p>Diminished to her cock, her cock a buoy</p>

<p>Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge</p>

<p>That on th’ unnumbered idle pebble chafes</p>

<p>Cannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more</p>

<p>Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight</p>

<p>Topple down headlong.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Set me where you stand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>Give me your hand. You are now within a foot</p>

<p>Of th’ extreme verge. For all beneath the moon</p>

<p>Would I not leap upright.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Let go my hand.</p>

<p>Here, friend, ’s another purse; in it a jewel</p>

<p>Well worth a poor man’s taking. Fairies and gods</p>

<p>Prosper it with thee.     <i><i>[He gives Edgar a purse.]</i></i></p>

<p>Go thou further off.</p>

<p>Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc> <i>[walking away]</i></p>

<p>Now fare you well, good sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  With all my heart.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>Why I do trifle thus with his despair</p>

<p>Is done to cure it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  O you mighty gods!     <i><i>[He kneels.]</i></i></p>

<p>This world I do renounce, and in your sights</p>

<p>Shake patiently my great affliction off.</p>

<p>If I could bear it longer, and not fall</p>

<p>To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,</p>

<p>My snuff and loathed part of nature should</p>

<p>Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!–</p>

<p>Now, fellow, fare thee well.     <i><i>[He falls.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Gone, sir. Farewell.–</p>

<p>And yet I know not how conceit may rob</p>

<p>The treasury of life, when life itself</p>

<p>Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,</p>

<p>By this had thought been past. Alive or dead?–</p>

<p>Ho you, sir! Friend, hear you. Sir, speak.–</p>

<p>Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.–</p>

<p>What are you, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Away, and let me die.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,</p>

<p>So many fathom down precipitating,</p>

<p>Thou ’dst shivered like an egg; but thou dost</p>

<p>breathe,</p>

<p>Hast heavy substance, bleed’st not, speak’st, art</p>

<p>sound.</p>

<p>Ten masts at each make not the altitude</p>

<p>Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.</p>

<p>Thy life’s a miracle. Speak yet again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  But have I fall’n or no?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.</p>

<p>Look up a-height. The shrill-gorged lark so far</p>

<p>Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Alack, I have no eyes.</p>

<p>Is wretchedness deprived that benefit</p>

<p>To end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort</p>

<p>When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage</p>

<p>And frustrate his proud will.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Give me your arm.</p>

<p><center><i>[He raises Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<p>Up. So, how is ’t? Feel you your legs? You stand.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Too well, too well.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  This is above all strangeness.</p>

<p>Upon the crown o’ th’ cliff, what thing was that</p>

<p>Which parted from you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  A poor unfortunate beggar.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>As I stood here below, methought his eyes</p>

<p>Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,</p>

<p>Horns whelked and waved like the enraged sea.</p>

<p>It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,</p>

<p>Think that the clearest gods, who make them</p>

<p>honors</p>

<p>Of men’s impossibilities, have preserved thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>I do remember now. Henceforth I’ll bear</p>

<p>Affliction till it do cry out itself</p>

<p>“Enough, enough!” and die. That thing you speak of,</p>

<p>I took it for a man. Often ’twould say</p>

<p>“The fiend, the fiend!” He led me to that place.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>Bear free and patient thoughts.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lear.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>But who comes here?</p>

<p>The safer sense will ne’er accommodate</p>

<p>His master thus.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  No, they cannot touch me for coining. I am the</p>

<p>King himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  O, thou side-piercing sight!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Nature’s above art in that respect. There’s your</p>

<p>press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a</p>

<p>crowkeeper. Draw me a clothier’s yard. Look, look,</p>

<p>a mouse! Peace, peace! This piece of toasted cheese</p>

<p>will do ’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll prove it on a</p>

<p>giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!</p>

<p>I’ th’ clout, i’ th’ clout! Hewgh! Give the word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Sweet marjoram.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Pass.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  I know that voice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flattered</p>

<p>me like a dog and told me I had the white hairs in</p>

<p>my beard ere the black ones were there. To say “ay”</p>

<p>and “no” to everything that I said “ay” and “no” to</p>

<p>was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me</p>

<p>once and the wind to make me chatter, when the</p>

<p>thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I</p>

<p>found ’em, there I smelt ’em out. Go to. They are</p>

<p>not men o’ their words; they told me I was everything.</p>

<p>’Tis a lie. I am not ague-proof.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>The trick of that voice I do well remember.</p>

<p>Is ’t not the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Ay, every inch a king.</p>

<p>When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.</p>

<p>I pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?</p>

<p>Adultery? Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.</p>

<p>The wren goes to ’t, and the small gilded fly does</p>

<p>lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive, for</p>

<p>Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to his father</p>

<p>than my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets. To</p>

<p>’t, luxury, pell-mell, for I lack soldiers. Behold yond</p>

<p>simp’ring dame, whose face between her forks</p>

<p>presages snow, that minces virtue and does shake</p>

<p>the head to hear of pleasure’s name. The fitchew</p>

<p>nor the soiled horse goes to ’t with a more riotous</p>

<p>appetite. Down from the waist they are centaurs,</p>

<p>though women all above. But to the girdle do the</p>

<p>gods inherit; beneath is all the fiend’s. There’s hell,</p>

<p>there’s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit; burning,</p>

<p>scalding, stench, consumption! Fie, fie, fie, pah,</p>

<p>pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary;</p>

<p>sweeten my imagination. There’s money for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  O, let me kiss that hand!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>O ruined piece of nature! This great world</p>

<p>Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou</p>

<p>squinny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid, I’ll</p>

<p>not love. Read thou this challenge. Mark but the</p>

<p>penning of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Were all thy letters suns, I could not see.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>I would not take this from report. It is,</p>

<p>And my heart breaks at it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Read.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  What, with the case of eyes?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  O ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your</p>

<p>head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in</p>

<p>a heavy case, your purse in a light, yet you see how</p>

<p>this world goes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  I see it feelingly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  What, art mad? A man may see how this world</p>

<p>goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears. See how</p>

<p>yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark in</p>

<p>thine ear. Change places and, handy-dandy, which</p>

<p>is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a</p>

<p>farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Ay, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  And the creature run from the cur? There thou</p>

<p>might’st behold the great image of authority: a</p>

<p>dog’s obeyed in office.</p>

<p>Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!</p>

<p>Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thy own back.</p>

<p>Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind</p>

<p>For which thou whipp’st her. The usurer hangs the</p>

<p>cozener.</p>

<p>Through tattered clothes small vices do appear.</p>

<p>Robes and furred gowns hide all. Plate sin with</p>

<p>gold,</p>

<p>And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks.</p>

<p>Arm it in rags, a pygmy’s straw does pierce it.</p>

<p>None does offend, none, I say, none; I’ll able ’em.</p>

<p>Take that of me, my friend, who have the power</p>

<p>To seal th’ accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes,</p>

<p>And like a scurvy politician</p>

<p>Seem to see the things thou dost not. Now, now,</p>

<p>now, now.</p>

<p>Pull off my boots. Harder, harder. So.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>O, matter and impertinency mixed,</p>

<p>Reason in madness!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.</p>

<p>I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.</p>

<p>Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;</p>

<p>Thou know’st the first time that we smell the air</p>

<p>We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Alack, alack the day!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>When we are born, we cry that we are come</p>

<p>To this great stage of fools.–This’ a good block.</p>

<p>It were a delicate stratagem to shoe</p>

<p>A troop of horse with felt. I’ll put ’t in proof,</p>

<p>And when I have stol’n upon these son-in-laws,</p>

<p>Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!</p>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Gentleman and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc> <i>[noticing Lear]</i></p>

<p>O, here he is. <i>[To an Attendant.]</i> Lay hand upon</p>

<p>him.–Sir,</p>

<p>Your most dear daughter–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even</p>

<p>The natural fool of Fortune. Use me well.</p>

<p>You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;</p>

<p>I am cut to th’ brains.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  You shall have anything.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  No seconds? All myself?</p>

<p>Why, this would make a man a man of salt,</p>

<p>To use his eyes for garden waterpots,</p>

<p>Ay, and laying autumn’s dust.</p>

<p>I will die bravely like a smug bridegroom. What?</p>

<p>I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king,</p>

<p>Masters, know you that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>You are a royal one, and we obey you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Then there’s life in ’t. Come, an you get it, you</p>

<p>shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.</p>

<p><center><i>[The King exits running pursued by Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,</p>

<p>Past speaking of in a king. Thou hast a daughter</p>

<p>Who redeems nature from the general curse</p>

<p>Which twain have brought her to.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Hail, gentle sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  Sir, speed you. What’s your will?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Most sure and vulgar. Everyone hears that,</p>

<p>Which can distinguish sound.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  But, by your favor,</p>

<p>How near’s the other army?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Near and on speedy foot. The main descry</p>

<p>Stands on the hourly thought.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  I thank you, sir. That’s all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Though that the Queen on special cause is here,</p>

<p>Her army is moved on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  I thank you, sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gentleman exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Now, good sir, what are you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>A most poor man, made tame to Fortune’s blows,</p>

<p>Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,</p>

<p>Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;</p>

<p>I’ll lead you to some biding.</p>

<p><center><i>[He takes Gloucester’s hand.]</i></center></p>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Sit you down, father; rest you.</p>

<p>Let’s see these pockets. The letters that he speaks of</p>
