<p><center><i>[Enter Lear, Fool, and Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>’Tis strange that they should so depart from home</p>

<p>And not send back my messenger.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  As I learned,</p>

<p>The night before there was no purpose in them</p>

<p>Of this remove.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc> <i>[waking]</i>  Hail to thee, noble master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Ha?</p>

<p>Mak’st thou this shame thy pastime?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  No, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Ha, ha, he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied</p>

<p>by the heads, dogs and bears by th’ neck, monkeys</p>

<p>by th’ loins, and men by th’ legs. When a man’s</p>

<p>overlusty at legs, then he wears wooden</p>

<p>netherstocks.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>What’s he that hath so much thy place mistook</p>

<p>To set thee here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  It is both he and she,</p>

<p>Your son and daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  No, I say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  I say yea.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  By Jupiter, I swear no.</p>

<br/>

<p>KENTBy Juno, I swear ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  They durst not do ’t.</p>

<p>They could not, would not do ’t. ’Tis worse than</p>

<p>murder</p>

<p>To do upon respect such violent outrage.</p>

<p>Resolve me with all modest haste which way</p>

<p>Thou might’st deserve or they impose this usage,</p>

<p>Coming from us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  My lord, when at their home</p>

<p>I did commend your Highness’ letters to them,</p>

<p>Ere I was risen from the place that showed</p>

<p>My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,</p>

<p>Stewed in his haste, half breathless, panting forth</p>

<p>From Goneril his mistress salutations;</p>

<p>Delivered letters, spite of intermission,</p>

<p>Which presently they read; on whose contents</p>

<p>They summoned up their meiny, straight took</p>

<p>horse,</p>

<p>Commanded me to follow and attend</p>

<p>The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks;</p>

<p>And meeting here the other messenger,</p>

<p>Whose welcome, I perceived, had poisoned mine,</p>

<p>Being the very fellow which of late</p>

<p>Displayed so saucily against your Highness,</p>

<p>Having more man than wit about me, drew.</p>

<p>He raised the house with loud and coward cries.</p>

<p>Your son and daughter found this trespass worth</p>

<p>The shame which here it suffers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Winter’s not gone yet if the wild geese fly that</p>

<p>way.</p>

<p>     <i>Fathers that wear rags</i></p>

<p>        <i>Do make their children blind,</i></p>

<p>     <i>But fathers that bear bags</i></p>

<p>        <i>Shall see their children kind.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fortune, that arrant whore,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Ne’er turns the key to th’ poor.</i></p>

<p>But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolors for</p>

<p>thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!</p>

<p>Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow!</p>

<p>Thy element’s below.–Where is this daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  With the Earl, sir, here within.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc> <i>[to Fool and Gentleman]</i>  Follow me not. Stay</p>

<p>here.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Made you no more offense but what you speak of?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  None.</p>

<p>How chance the King comes with so small a number?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  An thou hadst been set i’ th’ stocks for that</p>

<p>question, thou ’dst well deserved it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Why, Fool?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  We’ll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee</p>

<p>there’s no laboring i’ th’ winter. All that follow</p>

<p>their noses are led by their eyes but blind men, and</p>

<p>there’s not a nose among twenty but can smell him</p>

<p>that’s stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel</p>

<p>runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with following;</p>

<p>but the great one that goes upward, let him</p>

<p>draw thee after. When a wise man gives thee better</p>

<p>counsel, give me mine again. I would have none but</p>

<p>knaves follow it, since a Fool gives it.</p>

<p>     <i>That sir which serves and seeks for gain,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And follows but for form,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Will pack when it begins to rain</i></p>

<p>        <i>And leave thee in the storm.</i></p>

<p>     <i>But I will tarry; the Fool will stay,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And let the wise man fly.</i></p>

<p>     <i>The knave turns fool that runs away;</i></p>

<p>        <i>The Fool no knave, perdie.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Where learned you this, Fool?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Not i’ th’ stocks, fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lear and Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Deny to speak with me? They are sick? They are</p>

<p>weary?</p>

<p>They have traveled all the night? Mere fetches,</p>

<p>The images of revolt and flying off.</p>

<p>Fetch me a better answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  My dear lord,</p>

<p>You know the fiery quality of the Duke,</p>

<p>How unremovable and fixed he is</p>

<p>In his own course.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Vengeance, plague, death, confusion!</p>

<p>“Fiery”? What “quality”? Why Gloucester,</p>

<p>Gloucester,</p>

<p>I’d speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Well, my good lord, I have informed them so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>“Informed them”? Dost thou understand me,</p>

<p>man?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Ay, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>The King would speak with Cornwall. The dear</p>

<p>father</p>

<p>Would with his daughter speak, commands, tends</p>

<p>service.</p>

<p>Are they “informed” of this? My breath and</p>

<p>blood!</p>

<p>“Fiery”? The “fiery” duke? Tell the hot duke that–</p>

<p>No, but not yet. Maybe he is not well.</p>

<p>Infirmity doth still neglect all office</p>

<p>Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves</p>

<p>When nature, being oppressed, commands the mind</p>

<p>To suffer with the body. I’ll forbear,</p>

<p>And am fallen out with my more headier will,</p>

<p>To take the indisposed and sickly fit</p>

<p>For the sound man. <i>[Noticing Kent again.]</i> Death on</p>

<p>my state! Wherefore</p>

<p>Should he sit here? This act persuades me</p>

<p>That this remotion of the Duke and her</p>

<p>Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.</p>

<p>Go tell the Duke and ’s wife I’d speak with them.</p>

<p>Now, presently, bid them come forth and hear me,</p>

<p>Or at their chamber door I’ll beat the drum</p>

<p>Till it cry sleep to death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  I would have all well betwixt you.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Fool</sc>  Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels</p>

<p>when she put ’em i’ th’ paste alive. She knapped</p>

<p>’em o’ th’ coxcombs with a stick and cried “Down,</p>

<p>wantons, down!” ’Twas her brother that in pure</p>

<p>kindness to his horse buttered his hay.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Good morrow to you both.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  Hail to your Grace.</p>

<p><center><i>[Kent here set at liberty.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  I am glad to see your Highness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Regan, I think you are. I know what reason</p>

<p>I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,</p>

<p>I would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb,</p>

<p>Sepulch’ring an adult’ress. <i>[To Kent.]</i> O, are you</p>

<p>free?</p>

<p>Some other time for that.–Beloved Regan,</p>

<p>Thy sister’s naught. O Regan, she hath tied</p>

<p>Sharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture, here.</p>

<p>I can scarce speak to thee. Thou ’lt not believe</p>

<p>With how depraved a quality–O Regan!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope</p>

<p>You less know how to value her desert</p>

<p>Than she to scant her duty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Say? How is that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>I cannot think my sister in the least</p>

<p>Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance</p>

<p>She have restrained the riots of your followers,</p>

<p>’Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end</p>

<p>As clears her from all blame.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  My curses on her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  O sir, you are old.</p>

<p>Nature in you stands on the very verge</p>

<p>Of his confine. You should be ruled and led</p>

<p>By some discretion that discerns your state</p>

<p>Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you</p>

<p>That to our sister you do make return.</p>

<p>Say you have wronged her.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Ask her forgiveness?</p>

<p>Do you but mark how this becomes the house:</p>

<p><center><i>[He kneels.]</i></center></p>

<p>“Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.</p>

<p>Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg</p>

<p>That you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>Good sir, no more. These are unsightly tricks.</p>

<p>Return you to my sister.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc> <i>[rising]</i>  Never, Regan.</p>

<p>She hath abated me of half my train,</p>

<p>Looked black upon me, struck me with her tongue</p>

<p>Most serpentlike upon the very heart.</p>

<p>All the stored vengeances of heaven fall</p>

<p>On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,</p>

<p>You taking airs, with lameness!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  Fie, sir, fie!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames</p>

<p>Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,</p>

<p>You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun</p>

<p>To fall and blister!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>O, the blest gods! So will you wish on me</p>

<p>When the rash mood is on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.</p>

<p>Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give</p>

<p>Thee o’er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce, but</p>

<p>thine</p>

<p>Do comfort and not burn. ’Tis not in thee</p>

<p>To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,</p>

<p>To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,</p>

<p>And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt</p>

<p>Against my coming in. Thou better know’st</p>

<p>The offices of nature, bond of childhood,</p>

<p>Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.</p>

<p>Thy half o’ th’ kingdom hast thou not forgot,</p>

<p>Wherein I thee endowed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  Good sir, to th’ purpose.</p>

<p><center><i>[Tucket within.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Who put my man i’ th’ stocks?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  What trumpet’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>I know ’t–my sister’s. This approves her letter,</p>

<p>That she would soon be here.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Oswald, the Steward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Is your lady come?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>This is a slave whose easy-borrowed pride</p>

<p>Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.–</p>

<p>Out, varlet, from my sight!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  What means your Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Who stocked my servant? Regan, I have good hope</p>

<p>Thou didst not know on ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Goneril.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Who comes here? O heavens,</p>

<p>If you do love old men, if your sweet sway</p>

<p>Allow obedience, if you yourselves are old,</p>

<p>Make it your cause. Send down and take my part.</p>

<p><i>[To Goneril.]</i> Art not ashamed to look upon this</p>

<p>beard?     <i><i>[Regan takes Goneril’s hand.]</i></i></p>

<p>O Regan, will you take her by the hand?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc></p>

<p>Why not by th’ hand, sir? How have I offended?</p>

<p>All’s not offense that indiscretion finds</p>

<p>And dotage terms so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  O sides, you are too tough!</p>

<p>Will you yet hold?–How came my man i’ th’</p>

<p>stocks?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>I set him there, sir, but his own disorders</p>

<p>Deserved much less advancement.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  You? Did you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.</p>

<p>If till the expiration of your month</p>

<p>You will return and sojourn with my sister,</p>

<p>Dismissing half your train, come then to me.</p>

<p>I am now from home and out of that provision</p>

<p>Which shall be needful for your entertainment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Return to her? And fifty men dismissed?</p>

<p>No! Rather I abjure all roofs, and choose</p>

<p>To wage against the enmity o’ th’ air,</p>

<p>To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,</p>

<p>Necessity’s sharp pinch. Return with her?</p>

<p>Why the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took</p>

<p>Our youngest born–I could as well be brought</p>

<p>To knee his throne and, squire-like, pension beg</p>

<p>To keep base life afoot. Return with her?</p>

<p>Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter</p>

<p>To this detested groom.     <i><i>[He indicates Oswald.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  At your choice, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.</p>

<p>I will not trouble thee, my child. Farewell.</p>

<p>We’ll no more meet, no more see one another.</p>

<p>But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter,</p>

<p>Or, rather, a disease that’s in my flesh,</p>

<p>Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,</p>

<p>A plague-sore or embossed carbuncle</p>

<p>In my corrupted blood. But I’ll not chide thee.</p>

<p>Let shame come when it will; I do not call it.</p>

<p>I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,</p>

<p>Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.</p>

<p>Mend when thou canst. Be better at thy leisure.</p>

<p>I can be patient. I can stay with Regan,</p>

<p>I and my hundred knights.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  Not altogether so.</p>

<p>I looked not for you yet, nor am provided</p>

<p>For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister,</p>

<p>For those that mingle reason with your passion</p>

<p>Must be content to think you old, and so–</p>

<p>But she knows what she does.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Is this well spoken?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?</p>

<p>Is it not well? What should you need of more?</p>

<p>Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger</p>

<p>Speak ’gainst so great a number? How in one house</p>

<p>Should many people under two commands</p>

<p>Hold amity? ’Tis hard, almost impossible.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc></p>

<p>Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance</p>

<p>From those that she calls servants, or from mine?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack</p>

<p>you,</p>

<p>We could control them. If you will come to me</p>

<p>(For now I spy a danger), I entreat you</p>

<p>To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more</p>

<p>Will I give place or notice.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  I gave you all–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  And in good time you gave it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Made you my guardians, my depositaries,</p>

<p>But kept a reservation to be followed</p>

<p>With such a number. What, must I come to you</p>

<p>With five-and-twenty? Regan, said you so?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>And speak ’t again, my lord. No more with me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favored</p>

<p>When others are more wicked. Not being the worst</p>

<p>Stands in some rank of praise. <i>[To Goneril.]</i> I’ll go</p>

<p>with thee.</p>

<p>Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,</p>

<p>And thou art twice her love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  Hear me, my lord.</p>

<p>What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,</p>

<p>To follow in a house where twice so many</p>

<p>Have a command to tend you?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  What need one?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars</p>

<p>Are in the poorest thing superfluous.</p>

<p>Allow not nature more than nature needs,</p>

<p>Man’s life is cheap as beast’s. Thou art a lady;</p>

<p>If only to go warm were gorgeous,</p>

<p>Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st,</p>

<p>Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true</p>

<p>need–</p>

<p>You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!</p>

<p>You see me here, you gods, a poor old man</p>

<p>As full of grief as age, wretched in both.</p>

<p>If it be you that stirs these daughters’ hearts</p>

<p>Against their father, fool me not so much</p>

<p>To bear it tamely. Touch me with noble anger,</p>

<p>And let not women’s weapons, water drops,</p>

<p>Stain my man’s cheeks.–No, you unnatural hags,</p>

<p>I will have such revenges on you both</p>

<p>That all the world shall–I will do such things–</p>

<p>What they are yet I know not, but they shall be</p>

<p>The terrors of the Earth! You think I’ll weep.</p>

<p>No, I’ll not weep.</p>

<p>I have full cause of weeping, but this heart</p>

<p><center><i>[Storm and tempest.]</i></center></p>

<p>Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws</p>

<p>Or ere I’ll weep.–O Fool, I shall go mad!</p>

<p><center><i>[Lear, Kent, and Fool exit</p>

<p>with Gloucester and the Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  Let us withdraw. ’Twill be a storm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>This house is little. The old man and ’s people</p>

<p>Cannot be well bestowed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc></p>

<p>’Tis his own blame hath put himself from rest,</p>

<p>And must needs taste his folly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>For his particular, I’ll receive him gladly,</p>

<p>But not one follower.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc></p>

<p>So am I purposed. Where is my lord of Gloucester?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>Followed the old man forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>He is returned.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  The King is in high rage.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  Whither is he going?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>’Tis best to give him way. He leads himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc> <i>[to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Alack, the night comes on, and the high winds</p>

<p>Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about</p>

<p>There’s scarce a bush.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  O sir, to willful men</p>

<p>The injuries that they themselves procure</p>

<p>Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.</p>
