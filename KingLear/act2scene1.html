<p><center><i>[Enter Edmund, the Bastard and Curan, severally.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  Save thee, Curan.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curan</sc>  And you, sir. I have been with your father and</p>

<p>given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and</p>

<p>Regan his duchess will be here with him this night.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  How comes that?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curan</sc>  Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news</p>

<p>abroad?–I mean the whispered ones, for they are</p>

<p>yet but ear-kissing arguments.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  Not I. Pray you, what are they?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curan</sc>  Have you heard of no likely wars toward ’twixt</p>

<p>the dukes of Cornwall and Albany?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  Not a word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Curan</sc>  You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>The Duke be here tonight? The better, best.</p>

<p>This weaves itself perforce into my business.</p>

<p>My father hath set guard to take my brother,</p>

<p>And I have one thing of a queasy question</p>

<p>Which I must act. Briefness and fortune work!–</p>

<p>Brother, a word. Descend. Brother, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Edgar.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>My father watches. O sir, fly this place!</p>

<p>Intelligence is given where you are hid.</p>

<p>You have now the good advantage of the night.</p>

<p>Have you not spoken ’gainst the Duke of Cornwall?</p>

<p>He’s coming hither, now, i’ th’ night, i’ th’ haste,</p>

<p>And Regan with him. Have you nothing said</p>

<p>Upon his party ’gainst the Duke of Albany?</p>

<p>Advise yourself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  I am sure on ’t, not a word.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>I hear my father coming. Pardon me.</p>

<p>In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.</p>

<p>Draw. Seem to defend yourself. Now, quit you</p>

<p>well.     <i><i>[They draw.]</i></i></p>

<p>Yield! Come before my father! Light, hoa, here!</p>

<p><i>[Aside to Edgar.]</i> Fly, brother.–Torches, torches!</p>

<p>–So, farewell.     <i><i>[Edgar exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion</p>

<p>Of my more fierce endeavor. I have seen drunkards</p>

<p>Do more than this in sport.     <i><i>[He wounds his arm.]</i></i></p>

<p>Father, father!</p>

<p>Stop, stop! No help?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Now, Edmund, where’s the</p>

<p>villain?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,</p>

<p>Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon</p>

<p>To stand auspicious mistress.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  But where is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>Look, sir, I bleed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Where is the villain,</p>

<p>Edmund?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Pursue him, ho! Go after. <i>[Servants exit.]</i> By no</p>

<p>means what?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>Persuade me to the murder of your Lordship,</p>

<p>But that I told him the revenging gods</p>

<p>’Gainst parricides did all the thunder bend,</p>

<p>Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond</p>

<p>The child was bound to th’ father–sir, in fine,</p>

<p>Seeing how loathly opposite I stood</p>

<p>To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion</p>

<p>With his prepared sword he charges home</p>

<p>My unprovided body, lanced mine arm;</p>

<p>And when he saw my best alarumed spirits,</p>

<p>Bold in the quarrel’s right, roused to th’ encounter,</p>

<p>Or whether ghasted by the noise I made,</p>

<p>Full suddenly he fled.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Let him fly far!</p>

<p>Not in this land shall he remain uncaught,</p>

<p>And found–dispatch. The noble duke my master,</p>

<p>My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.</p>

<p>By his authority I will proclaim it</p>

<p>That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,</p>

<p>Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;</p>

<p>He that conceals him, death.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>When I dissuaded him from his intent</p>

<p>And found him pight to do it, with curst speech</p>

<p>I threatened to discover him. He replied</p>

<p>“Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think</p>

<p>If I would stand against thee, would the reposal</p>

<p>Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee</p>

<p>Make thy words faithed? No. What I should</p>

<p>deny–</p>

<p>As this I would, though thou didst produce</p>

<p>My very character–I’d turn it all</p>

<p>To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice.</p>

<p>And thou must make a dullard of the world</p>

<p>If they not thought the profits of my death</p>

<p>Were very pregnant and potential spurs</p>

<p>To make thee seek it.”</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  O strange and fastened villain!</p>

<p>Would he deny his letter, said he?</p>

<p>I never got him.     <i><i>[Tucket within.]</i></i></p>

<p>Hark, the Duke’s trumpets. I know not why he</p>

<p>comes.</p>

<p>All ports I’ll bar. The villain shall not ’scape.</p>

<p>The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture</p>

<p>I will send far and near, that all the kingdom</p>

<p>May have due note of him. And of my land,</p>

<p>Loyal and natural boy, I’ll work the means</p>

<p>To make thee capable.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither,</p>

<p>Which I can call but now, I have heard strange</p>

<p>news.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>If it be true, all vengeance comes too short</p>

<p>Which can pursue th’ offender. How dost, my</p>

<p>lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>O madam, my old heart is cracked; it’s cracked.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>What, did my father’s godson seek your life?</p>

<p>He whom my father named, your Edgar?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>Was he not companion with the riotous knights</p>

<p>That tended upon my father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>I know not, madam. ’Tis too bad, too bad.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>Yes, madam, he was of that consort.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>No marvel, then, though he were ill affected.</p>

<p>’Tis they have put him on the old man’s death,</p>

<p>To have th’ expense and waste of his revenues.</p>

<p>I have this present evening from my sister</p>

<p>Been well informed of them, and with such cautions</p>

<p>That if they come to sojourn at my house</p>

<p>I’ll not be there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  Nor I, assure thee, Regan.–</p>

<p>Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father</p>

<p>A childlike office.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  It was my duty, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>He did bewray his practice, and received</p>

<p>This hurt you see striving to apprehend him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc>  Is he pursued?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Ay, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>If he be taken, he shall never more</p>

<p>Be feared of doing harm. Make your own purpose,</p>

<p>How in my strength you please.–For you, Edmund,</p>

<p>Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant</p>

<p>So much commend itself, you shall be ours.</p>

<p>Natures of such deep trust we shall much need.</p>

<p>You we first seize on.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  I shall serve you, sir,</p>

<p>Truly, however else.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  For him I thank your Grace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cornwall</sc></p>

<p>You know not why we came to visit you–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night.</p>

<p>Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,</p>

<p>Wherein we must have use of your advice.</p>

<p>Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,</p>

<p>Of differences, which I best thought it fit</p>

<p>To answer from our home. The several messengers</p>

<p>From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,</p>

<p>Lay comforts to your bosom and bestow</p>

<p>Your needful counsel to our businesses,</p>

<p>Which craves the instant use.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  I serve you, madam.</p>

<p>Your Graces are right welcome.</p>
