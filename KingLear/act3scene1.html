<p><center><i>[Storm still. Enter Kent in disguise, and a Gentleman,</p>

<p>severally.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Who’s there, besides foul weather?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>One minded like the weather, most unquietly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  I know you. Where’s the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Contending with the fretful elements;</p>

<p>Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea</p>

<p>Or swell the curled waters ’bove the main,</p>

<p>That things might change or cease; tears his white</p>

<p>hair,</p>

<p>Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage</p>

<p>Catch in their fury and make nothing of;</p>

<p>Strives in his little world of man to outscorn</p>

<p>The to-and-fro conflicting wind and rain.</p>

<p>This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would</p>

<p>couch,</p>

<p>The lion and the belly-pinched wolf</p>

<p>Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs</p>

<p>And bids what will take all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  But who is with him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>None but the Fool, who labors to outjest</p>

<p>His heart-struck injuries.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Sir, I do know you</p>

<p>And dare upon the warrant of my note</p>

<p>Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,</p>

<p>Although as yet the face of it is covered</p>

<p>With mutual cunning, ’twixt Albany and Cornwall,</p>

<p>Who have–as who have not, that their great stars</p>

<p>Throned and set high?–servants, who seem no less,</p>

<p>Which are to France the spies and speculations</p>

<p>Intelligent of our state. From France there comes</p>

<p>a power</p>

<p>Into this scattered kingdom, who already,</p>

<p>Wise in our negligence, have secret feet</p>

<p>In some of our best ports and are at point</p>

<p>To show their open banner. Now to you:</p>

<p>If on my credit you dare build so far</p>

<p>To make your speed to Dover, you shall find</p>

<p>Some that will thank you, making just report</p>

<p>Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow</p>

<p>The King hath cause to plain: what hath been seen,</p>

<p>Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,</p>

<p>Or the hard rein which both of them hath borne</p>

<p>Against the old kind king, or something deeper,</p>

<p>Whereof perchance these are but furnishings.</p>

<p>I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,</p>

<p>And from some knowledge and assurance offer</p>

<p>This office to you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>I will talk further with you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  No, do not.</p>

<p>For confirmation that I am much more</p>

<p>Than my outwall, open this purse and take</p>

<p>What it contains.</p>

<p><center><i>[Kent hands him a purse and a ring.]</i></center></p>

<p>If you shall see Cordelia</p>

<p>(As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,</p>

<p>And she will tell you who that fellow is</p>

<p>That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!</p>

<p>I will go seek the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:</p>

<p>That when we have found the King–in which your</p>

<p>pain</p>

<p>That way, I’ll this–he that first lights on him</p>

<p>Holla the other.</p>
