<p><center><i>[Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  I thought the King had more affected the Duke</p>

<p>of Albany than Cornwall.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  It did always seem so to us, but now in</p>

<p>the division of the kingdom, it appears not which</p>

<p>of the dukes he values most, for equalities are so</p>

<p>weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice</p>

<p>of either’s moiety.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Is not this your son, my lord?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  His breeding, sir, hath been at my</p>

<p>charge. I have so often blushed to acknowledge</p>

<p>him that now I am brazed to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  I cannot conceive you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Sir, this young fellow’s mother could,</p>

<p>whereupon she grew round-wombed and had indeed,</p>

<p>sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband</p>

<p>for her bed. Do you smell a fault?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it</p>

<p>being so proper.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  But I have a son, sir, by order of law,</p>

<p>some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in</p>

<p>my account. Though this knave came something</p>

<p>saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was</p>

<p>his mother fair, there was good sport at his making,</p>

<p>and the whoreson must be acknowledged.–Do you</p>

<p>know this noble gentleman, Edmund?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  No, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  My lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter</p>

<p>as my honorable friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  My services to your Lordship.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  I must love you and sue to know you better.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  Sir, I shall study deserving.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  He hath been out nine years, and away he</p>

<p>shall again. <i>[(Sennet.)]</i> The King is coming.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter King Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan,</p>

<p>Cordelia, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,</p>

<p>Gloucester.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  I shall, my lord.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.–</p>

<p>Give me the map there.     <i><i>[He is handed a map.]</i></i></p>

<p>Know that we have divided</p>

<p>In three our kingdom, and ’tis our fast intent</p>

<p>To shake all cares and business from our age,</p>

<p>Conferring them on younger strengths, while we</p>

<p>Unburdened crawl toward death. Our son of</p>

<p>Cornwall</p>

<p>And you, our no less loving son of Albany,</p>

<p>We have this hour a constant will to publish</p>

<p>Our daughters’ several dowers, that future strife</p>

<p>May be prevented now.</p>

<p>The two great princes, France and Burgundy,</p>

<p>Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,</p>

<p>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn</p>

<p>And here are to be answered. Tell me, my</p>

<p>daughters–</p>

<p>Since now we will divest us both of rule,</p>

<p>Interest of territory, cares of state–</p>

<p>Which of you shall we say doth love us most,</p>

<p>That we our largest bounty may extend</p>

<p>Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,</p>

<p>Our eldest born, speak first.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc></p>

<p>Sir, I love you more than word can wield the</p>

<p>matter,</p>

<p>Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,</p>

<p>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,</p>

<p>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honor;</p>

<p>As much as child e’er loved, or father found;</p>

<p>A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.</p>

<p>Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc> <i>[aside]</i></p>

<p>What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc> <i>[pointing to the map]</i></p>

<p>Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,</p>

<p>With shadowy forests and with champains riched,</p>

<p>With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,</p>

<p>We make thee lady. To thine and Albany’s issue</p>

<p>Be this perpetual.–What says our second</p>

<p>daughter,</p>

<p>Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>I am made of that self mettle as my sister</p>

<p>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart</p>

<p>I find she names my very deed of love;</p>

<p>Only she comes too short, that I profess</p>

<p>Myself an enemy to all other joys</p>

<p>Which the most precious square of sense</p>

<p>possesses,</p>

<p>And find I am alone felicitate</p>

<p>In your dear Highness’ love.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  Then poor Cordelia!</p>

<p>And yet not so, since I am sure my love’s</p>

<p>More ponderous than my tongue.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>To thee and thine hereditary ever</p>

<p>Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,</p>

<p>No less in space, validity, and pleasure</p>

<p>Than that conferred on Goneril.–Now, our joy,</p>

<p>Although our last and least, to whose young love</p>

<p>The vines of France and milk of Burgundy</p>

<p>Strive to be interessed, what can you say to draw</p>

<p>A third more opulent than your sisters’? Speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  Nothing, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Nothing?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  Nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Nothing will come of nothing. Speak again.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc></p>

<p>Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave</p>

<p>My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty</p>

<p>According to my bond, no more nor less.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,</p>

<p>Lest you may mar your fortunes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  Good my lord,</p>

<p>You have begot me, bred me, loved me.</p>

<p>I return those duties back as are right fit:</p>

<p>Obey you, love you, and most honor you.</p>

<p>Why have my sisters husbands if they say</p>

<p>They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,</p>

<p>That lord whose hand must take my plight shall</p>

<p>carry</p>

<p>Half my love with him, half my care and duty.</p>

<p>Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,</p>

<p>To love my father all.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  But goes thy heart with this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  Ay, my good lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  So young and so untender?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  So young, my lord, and true.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Let it be so. Thy truth, then, be thy dower,</p>

<p>For by the sacred radiance of the sun,</p>

<p>The mysteries of Hecate and the night,</p>

<p>By all the operation of the orbs</p>

<p>From whom we do exist and cease to be,</p>

<p>Here I disclaim all my paternal care,</p>

<p>Propinquity, and property of blood,</p>

<p>And as a stranger to my heart and me</p>

<p>Hold thee from this forever. The barbarous</p>

<p>Scythian,</p>

<p>Or he that makes his generation messes</p>

<p>To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom</p>

<p>Be as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved</p>

<p>As thou my sometime daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Good my liege–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Peace, Kent.</p>

<p>Come not between the dragon and his wrath.</p>

<p>I loved her most and thought to set my rest</p>

<p>On her kind nursery. <i>[To Cordelia.]</i> Hence and avoid</p>

<p>my sight!–</p>

<p>So be my grave my peace as here I give</p>

<p>Her father’s heart from her.–Call France. Who stirs?</p>

<p>Call Burgundy. <i>[An Attendant exits.]</i> Cornwall and</p>

<p>Albany,</p>

<p>With my two daughters’ dowers digest the third.</p>

<p>Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.</p>

<p>I do invest you jointly with my power,</p>

<p>Preeminence, and all the large effects</p>

<p>That troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,</p>

<p>With reservation of an hundred knights</p>

<p>By you to be sustained, shall our abode</p>

<p>Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain</p>

<p>The name and all th’ addition to a king.</p>

<p>The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,</p>

<p>Beloved sons, be yours, which to confirm,</p>

<p>This coronet part between you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Royal Lear,</p>

<p>Whom I have ever honored as my king,</p>

<p>Loved as my father, as my master followed,</p>

<p>As my great patron thought on in my prayers–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>The bow is bent and drawn. Make from the shaft.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>Let it fall rather, though the fork invade</p>

<p>The region of my heart. Be Kent unmannerly</p>

<p>When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?</p>

<p>Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak</p>

<p>When power to flattery bows? To plainness honor’s</p>

<p>bound</p>

<p>When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state,</p>

<p>And in thy best consideration check</p>

<p>This hideous rashness. Answer my life my</p>

<p>judgment,</p>

<p>Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,</p>

<p>Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sounds</p>

<p>Reverb no hollowness.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Kent, on thy life, no more.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>My life I never held but as a pawn</p>

<p>To wage against thine enemies, nor fear to lose</p>

<p>it,</p>

<p>Thy safety being motive.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Out of my sight!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>See better, Lear, and let me still remain</p>

<p>The true blank of thine eye.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Now, by Apollo–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Now, by Apollo, king,</p>

<p>Thou swear’st thy gods in vain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  O vassal! Miscreant!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>/<sc>Cornwall</sc>  Dear sir, forbear.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>Kill thy physician, and thy fee bestow</p>

<p>Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,</p>

<p>Or whilst I can vent clamor from my throat,</p>

<p>I’ll tell thee thou dost evil.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Hear me, recreant; on thine allegiance, hear me!</p>

<p>That thou hast sought to make us break our vows–</p>

<p>Which we durst never yet–and with strained pride</p>

<p>To come betwixt our sentence and our power,</p>

<p>Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,</p>

<p>Our potency made good, take thy reward:</p>

<p>Five days we do allot thee for provision</p>

<p>To shield thee from disasters of the world,</p>

<p>And on the sixth to turn thy hated back</p>

<p>Upon our kingdom. If on the tenth day following</p>

<p>Thy banished trunk be found in our dominions,</p>

<p>The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,</p>

<p>This shall not be revoked.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>Fare thee well, king. Sith thus thou wilt appear,</p>

<p>Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.</p>

<p><i>[To Cordelia.]</i> The gods to their dear shelter take</p>

<p>thee, maid,</p>

<p>That justly think’st and hast most rightly said.</p>

<p><i>[To Goneril and Regan.]</i> And your large speeches</p>

<p>may your deeds approve,</p>

<p>That good effects may spring from words of love.–</p>

<p>Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu.</p>

<p>He’ll shape his old course in a country new.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter Gloucester with France, and Burgundy,</p>

<p>and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc></p>

<p>Here’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  My lord of Burgundy,</p>

<p>We first address toward you, who with this king</p>

<p>Hath rivaled for our daughter. What in the least</p>

<p>Will you require in present dower with her,</p>

<p>Or cease your quest of love?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc>  Most royal Majesty,</p>

<p>I crave no more than hath your Highness offered,</p>

<p>Nor will you tender less.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Right noble Burgundy,</p>

<p>When she was dear to us, we did hold her so,</p>

<p>But now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands.</p>

<p>If aught within that little seeming substance,</p>

<p>Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced</p>

<p>And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,</p>

<p>She’s there, and she is yours.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc>  I know no answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Will you, with those infirmities she owes,</p>

<p>Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,</p>

<p>Dowered with our curse and strangered with our</p>

<p>oath,</p>

<p>Take her or leave her?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc>  Pardon me, royal sir,</p>

<p>Election makes not up in such conditions.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me</p>

<p>I tell you all her wealth.–For you, great king,</p>

<p>I would not from your love make such a stray</p>

<p>To match you where I hate. Therefore beseech you</p>

<p>T’ avert your liking a more worthier way</p>

<p>Than on a wretch whom Nature is ashamed</p>

<p>Almost t’ acknowledge hers.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>France</sc>  This is most strange,</p>

<p>That she whom even but now was your best</p>

<p>object,</p>

<p>The argument of your praise, balm of your age,</p>

<p>The best, the dearest, should in this trice of time</p>

<p>Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle</p>

<p>So many folds of favor. Sure her offense</p>

<p>Must be of such unnatural degree</p>

<p>That monsters it, or your forevouched affection</p>

<p>Fall into taint; which to believe of her</p>

<p>Must be a faith that reason without miracle</p>

<p>Should never plant in me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc> <i>[to Lear]</i>  I yet beseech your Majesty–</p>

<p>If for I want that glib and oily art</p>

<p>To speak and purpose not, since what I well</p>

<p>intend</p>

<p>I’ll do ’t before I speak–that you make known</p>

<p>It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,</p>

<p>No unchaste action or dishonored step</p>

<p>That hath deprived me of your grace and favor,</p>

<p>But even for want of that for which I am richer:</p>

<p>A still-soliciting eye and such a tongue</p>

<p>That I am glad I have not, though not to have it</p>

<p>Hath lost me in your liking.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Better thou</p>

<p>Hadst not been born than not t’ have pleased me</p>

<p>better.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>France</sc></p>

<p>Is it but this–a tardiness in nature</p>

<p>Which often leaves the history unspoke</p>

<p>That it intends to do?–My lord of Burgundy,</p>

<p>What say you to the lady? Love’s not love</p>

<p>When it is mingled with regards that stands</p>

<p>Aloof from th’ entire point. Will you have her?</p>

<p>She is herself a dowry.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc> <i>[to Lear]</i>  Royal king,</p>

<p>Give but that portion which yourself proposed,</p>

<p>And here I take Cordelia by the hand,</p>

<p>Duchess of Burgundy.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Nothing. I have sworn. I am firm.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Burgundy</sc> <i>[to Cordelia]</i></p>

<p>I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father</p>

<p>That you must lose a husband.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  Peace be with</p>

<p>Burgundy.</p>

<p>Since that respect and fortunes are his love,</p>

<p>I shall not be his wife.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>France</sc></p>

<p>Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich being poor;</p>

<p>Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised,</p>

<p>Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon,</p>

<p>Be it lawful I take up what’s cast away.</p>

<p>Gods, gods! ’Tis strange that from their cold’st</p>

<p>neglect</p>

<p>My love should kindle to enflamed respect.–</p>

<p>Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my</p>

<p>chance,</p>

<p>Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.</p>

<p>Not all the dukes of wat’rish Burgundy</p>

<p>Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.–</p>

<p>Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.</p>

<p>Thou losest here a better where to find.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Thou hast her, France. Let her be thine, for we</p>

<p>Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see</p>

<p>That face of hers again. <i>[To Cordelia.]</i> Therefore</p>

<p>begone</p>

<p>Without our grace, our love, our benison.–</p>

<p>Come, noble Burgundy.</p>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. All but France, Cordelia,</p>

<p>Goneril, and Regan exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>France</sc>  Bid farewell to your sisters.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc></p>

<p>The jewels of our father, with washed eyes</p>

<p>Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are,</p>

<p>And like a sister am most loath to call</p>

<p>Your faults as they are named. Love well our</p>

<p>father.</p>

<p>To your professed bosoms I commit him;</p>

<p>But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,</p>

<p>I would prefer him to a better place.</p>

<p>So farewell to you both.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>Prescribe not us our duty.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  Let your study</p>

<p>Be to content your lord, who hath received you</p>

<p>At Fortune’s alms. You have obedience scanted</p>

<p>And well are worth the want that you have wanted.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc></p>

<p>Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides,</p>

<p>Who covers faults at last with shame derides.</p>

<p>Well may you prosper.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>France</sc>  Come, my fair Cordelia.</p>

<p><center><i>[France and Cordelia exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  Sister, it is not little I have to say of what</p>

<p>most nearly appertains to us both. I think our</p>

<p>father will hence tonight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  That’s most certain, and with you; next month</p>

<p>with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  You see how full of changes his age is; the</p>

<p>observation we have made of it hath not been</p>

<p>little. He always loved our sister most, and with</p>

<p>what poor judgment he hath now cast her off</p>

<p>appears too grossly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  ’Tis the infirmity of his age. Yet he hath ever</p>

<p>but slenderly known himself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  The best and soundest of his time hath been</p>

<p>but rash. Then must we look from his age to</p>

<p>receive not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed</p>

<p>condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness</p>

<p>that infirm and choleric years bring with</p>

<p>them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  Such unconstant starts are we like to have</p>

<p>from him as this of Kent’s banishment.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  There is further compliment of leave-taking</p>

<p>between France and him. Pray you, let us sit</p>

<p>together. If our father carry authority with such</p>

<p>disposition as he bears, this last surrender of his will</p>

<p>but offend us.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  We shall further think of it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  We must do something, and i’ th’ heat.</p>
