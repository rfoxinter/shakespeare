<p><center><i>[Enter Edmund, the Bastard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span></p>

<p>Thou, Nature, art my goddess. To thy law</p>

<p>My services are bound. Wherefore should I</p>

<p>Stand in the plague of custom, and permit</p>

<p>The curiosity of nations to deprive me</p>

<p>For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines</p>

<p>Lag of a brother? why “bastard”? Wherefore “base,”</p>

<p>When my dimensions are as well compact,</p>

<p>My mind as generous and my shape as true</p>

<p>As honest madam’s issue? Why brand they us</p>

<p>With “base,” with “baseness,” “bastardy,” “base,”</p>

<p>“base,”</p>

<p>Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take</p>

<p>More composition and fierce quality</p>

<p>Than doth within a dull, stale, tired bed</p>

<p>Go to th’ creating a whole tribe of fops</p>

<p>Got ’tween asleep and wake? Well then,</p>

<p>Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.</p>

<p>Our father’s love is to the bastard Edmund</p>

<p>As to th’ legitimate. Fine word, “legitimate.”</p>

<p>Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed</p>

<p>And my invention thrive, Edmund the base</p>

<p>Shall top th’ legitimate. I grow, I prosper.</p>

<p>Now, gods, stand up for bastards!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gloucester.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Kent banished thus? And France in choler parted?</p>

<p>And the King gone tonight, prescribed his power,</p>

<p>Confined to exhibition? All this done</p>

<p>Upon the gad?–Edmund, how now? What news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  So please your Lordship, none. <i>[He puts a</p>

<p>paper in his pocket.]</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  Why so earnestly seek you to put up that</p>

<p>letter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  I know no news, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  What paper were you reading?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  Nothing, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  No? What needed then that terrible dispatch</p>

<p>of it into your pocket? The quality of nothing</p>

<p>hath not such need to hide itself. Let’s see. Come, if</p>

<p>it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter</p>

<p>from my brother that I have not all o’erread; and</p>

<p>for so much as I have perused, I find it not fit for</p>

<p>your o’erlooking.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  Give me the letter, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  I shall offend either to detain or give it. The</p>

<p>contents, as in part I understand them, are to</p>

<p>blame.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  Let’s see, let’s see.</p>

<p><center><i>[Edmund gives him the paper.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  I hope, for my brother’s justification, he</p>

<p>wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span> <i>[(reads)]</i>  This policy and reverence of age</p>

<p>makes the world bitter to the best of our times, keeps</p>

<p>our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish</p>

<p>them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the</p>

<p>oppression of aged tyranny, who sways not as it hath</p>

<p>power but as it is suffered. Come to me, that of this I</p>

<p>may speak more. If our father would sleep till I waked</p>

<p>him, you should enjoy half his revenue forever and</p>

<p>live the beloved of your brother.      <i>Edgar.</i></p>

<p>Hum? Conspiracy? “Sleep till I wake him, you</p>

<p>should enjoy half his revenue.” My son Edgar! Had</p>

<p>he a hand to write this? A heart and brain to breed it</p>

<p>in?–When came you to this? Who brought it?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  It was not brought me, my lord; there’s the</p>

<p>cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement</p>

<p>of my closet.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  You know the character to be your</p>

<p>brother’s?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  If the matter were good, my lord, I durst</p>

<p>swear it were his; but in respect of that, I would</p>

<p>fain think it were not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  It is his.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  It is his hand, my lord, but I hope his heart is</p>

<p>not in the contents.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  Has he never before sounded you in this</p>

<p>business?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft</p>

<p>maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age and</p>

<p>fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the</p>

<p>son, and the son manage his revenue.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  O villain, villain! His very opinion in the</p>

<p>letter. Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish</p>

<p>villain! Worse than brutish!–Go, sirrah, seek</p>

<p>him. I’ll apprehend him.–Abominable villain!–</p>

<p>Where is he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please</p>

<p>you to suspend your indignation against my brother</p>

<p>till you can derive from him better testimony of his</p>

<p>intent, you should run a certain course; where, if</p>

<p>you violently proceed against him, mistaking his</p>

<p>purpose, it would make a great gap in your own</p>

<p>honor and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience.</p>

<p>I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath</p>

<p>writ this to feel my affection to your Honor, and to</p>

<p>no other pretense of danger.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  Think you so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  If your Honor judge it meet, I will place you</p>

<p>where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an</p>

<p>auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that</p>

<p>without any further delay than this very evening.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  He cannot be such a monster.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  Nor is not, sure.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  To his father, that so tenderly and entirely</p>

<p>loves him! Heaven and Earth! Edmund, seek him</p>

<p>out; wind me into him, I pray you. Frame the</p>

<p>business after your own wisdom. I would unstate</p>

<p>myself to be in a due resolution.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  I will seek him, sir, presently, convey the</p>

<p>business as I shall find means, and acquaint you</p>

<p>withal.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  These late eclipses in the sun and moon</p>

<p>portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of</p>

<p>nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds</p>

<p>itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools,</p>

<p>friendship falls off, brothers divide; in cities, mutinies;</p>

<p>in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and</p>

<p>the bond cracked ’twixt son and father. This villain</p>

<p>of mine comes under the prediction: there’s son</p>

<p>against father. The King falls from bias of nature:</p>

<p>there’s father against child. We have seen the best of</p>

<p>our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and</p>

<p>all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our</p>

<p>graves.–Find out this villain, Edmund. It shall</p>

<p>lose thee nothing. Do it carefully.–And the noble</p>

<p>and true-hearted Kent banished! His offense, honesty!</p>

<p>’Tis strange.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  This is the excellent foppery of the world, that</p>

<p>when we are sick in fortune (often the surfeits of</p>

<p>our own behavior) we make guilty of our disasters</p>

<p>the sun, the moon, and stars, as if we were villains</p>

<p>on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves,</p>

<p>thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance;</p>

<p>drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced</p>

<p>obedience of planetary influence; and all that we</p>

<p>are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable</p>

<p>evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish</p>

<p>disposition on the charge of a star! My father</p>

<p>compounded with my mother under the Dragon’s</p>

<p>tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it</p>

<p>follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut, I should</p>

<p>have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the</p>

<p>firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Edgar.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>and pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old</p>

<p>comedy. My cue is villainous melancholy, with a</p>

<p>sigh like Tom o’ Bedlam.–O, these eclipses do</p>

<p>portend these divisions. Fa, sol, la, mi.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  How now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation</p>

<p>are you in?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read</p>

<p>this other day, what should follow these eclipses.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  Do you busy yourself with that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed</p>

<p>unhappily, as of unnaturalness between the</p>

<p>child and the parent, death, dearth, dissolutions of</p>

<p>ancient amities, divisions in state, menaces and</p>

<p>maledictions against king and nobles, needless diffidences,</p>

<p>banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,</p>

<p>nuptial breaches, and I know not what.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  How long have you been a sectary</p>

<p>astronomical?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  Come, come, when saw you my father last?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  The night gone by.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  Spake you with him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  Ay, two hours together.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  Parted you in good terms? Found you no</p>

<p>displeasure in him by word nor countenance?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  None at all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended</p>

<p>him, and at my entreaty forbear his presence</p>

<p>until some little time hath qualified the heat</p>

<p>of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in</p>

<p>him that with the mischief of your person it would</p>

<p>scarcely allay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  Some villain hath done me wrong.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  That’s my fear. I pray you have a continent</p>

<p>forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower;</p>

<p>and, as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from</p>

<p>whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak.</p>

<p>Pray you go. There’s my key. If you do stir abroad,</p>

<p>go armed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  Armed, brother?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  Brother, I advise you to the best. I am no</p>

<p>honest man if there be any good meaning toward</p>

<p>you. I have told you what I have seen and heard, but</p>

<p>faintly, nothing like the image and horror of it. Pray</p>

<p>you, away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  Shall I hear from you anon?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  I do serve you in this business.     <i><i>[Edgar exits.]</i></i></p>

<p>A credulous father and a brother noble,</p>

<p>Whose nature is so far from doing harms</p>

<p>That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty</p>

<p>My practices ride easy. I see the business.</p>

<p>Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit.</p>

<p>All with me’s meet that I can fashion fit.</p>
