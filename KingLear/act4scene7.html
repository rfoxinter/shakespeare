<p><center><i>[Enter Cordelia, Kent in disguise, Doctor, and</p>

<p>Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc></p>

<p>O, thou good Kent, how shall I live and work</p>

<p>To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,</p>

<p>And every measure fail me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>To be acknowledged, madam, is o’erpaid.</p>

<p>All my reports go with the modest truth,</p>

<p>Nor more, nor clipped, but so.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  Be better suited.</p>

<p>These weeds are memories of those worser hours.</p>

<p>I prithee put them off.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Pardon, dear madam.</p>

<p>Yet to be known shortens my made intent.</p>

<p>My boon I make it that you know me not</p>

<p>Till time and I think meet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc></p>

<p>Then be ’t so, my good lord.–How does the King?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Madam, sleeps still.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  O, you kind gods,</p>

<p>Cure this great breach in his abused nature!</p>

<p>Th’ untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up,</p>

<p>Of this child-changed father!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  So please your Majesty</p>

<p>That we may wake the King? He hath slept</p>

<p>long.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc></p>

<p>Be governed by your knowledge, and proceed</p>

<p>I’ th’ sway of your own will. Is he arrayed?</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lear in a chair carried by Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep,</p>

<p>We put fresh garments on him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.</p>

<p>I doubt not of his temperance.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  Very well.</p>

<p><center><i>[Music.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>Please you, draw near.–Louder the music there.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc> <i>[kissing Lear]</i></p>

<p>O, my dear father, restoration hang</p>

<p>Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss</p>

<p>Repair those violent harms that my two sisters</p>

<p>Have in thy reverence made.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Kind and dear princess.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc></p>

<p>Had you not been their father, these white flakes</p>

<p>Did challenge pity of them. Was this a face</p>

<p>To be opposed against the jarring winds?</p>

<p>To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder,</p>

<p>In the most terrible and nimble stroke</p>

<p>Of quick cross-lightning? To watch, poor perdu,</p>

<p>With this thin helm? Mine enemy’s dog,</p>

<p>Though he had bit me, should have stood that night</p>

<p>Against my fire. And wast thou fain, poor father,</p>

<p>To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn</p>

<p>In short and musty straw? Alack, alack,</p>

<p>’Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once</p>

<p>Had not concluded all.–He wakes. Speak to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc>  Madam, do you; ’tis fittest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc></p>

<p>How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>You do me wrong to take me out o’ th’ grave.</p>

<p>Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound</p>

<p>Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears</p>

<p>Do scald like molten lead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  Sir, do you know me?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>You are a spirit, I know. Where did you die?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  Still, still, far wide.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>He’s scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?</p>

<p>I am mightily abused; I should e’en die with pity</p>

<p>To see another thus. I know not what to say.</p>

<p>I will not swear these are my hands. Let’s see.</p>

<p>I feel this pinprick. Would I were assured</p>

<p>Of my condition!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  O, look upon me, sir,</p>

<p>And hold your hand in benediction o’er me.</p>

<p>No, sir, you must not kneel.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Pray do not mock:</p>

<p>I am a very foolish fond old man,</p>

<p>Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less,</p>

<p>And to deal plainly,</p>

<p>I fear I am not in my perfect mind.</p>

<p>Methinks I should know you and know this man,</p>

<p>Yet I am doubtful, for I am mainly ignorant</p>

<p>What place this is, and all the skill I have</p>

<p>Remembers not these garments; nor I know not</p>

<p>Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me,</p>

<p>For, as I am a man, I think this lady</p>

<p>To be my child Cordelia.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc> <i>[weeping]</i>  And so I am; I am.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray, weep not.</p>

<p>If you have poison for me, I will drink it.</p>

<p>I know you do not love me, for your sisters</p>

<p>Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.</p>

<p>You have some cause; they have not.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  No cause, no</p>

<p>cause.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Am I in France?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  In your own kingdom, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Do not abuse me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Doctor</sc></p>

<p>Be comforted, good madam. The great rage,</p>

<p>You see, is killed in him, and yet it is danger</p>

<p>To make him even o’er the time he has lost.</p>

<p>Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more</p>

<p>Till further settling.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc>  Will ’t please your Highness walk?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  You must bear with me.</p>

<p>Pray you now, forget, and forgive. I am old and</p>

<p>foolish.     <i><i>[They exit. Kent and Gentleman remain.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall</p>

<p>was so slain?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Most certain, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  Who is conductor of his people?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  They say Edgar, his banished son, is with</p>

<p>the Earl of Kent in Germany.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Report is changeable. ’Tis time to look about.</p>

<p>The powers of the kingdom approach apace.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc>  The arbitrament is like to be bloody. Fare</p>

<p>you well, sir.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>My point and period will be throughly wrought,</p>

<p>Or well, or ill, as this day’s battle’s fought.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>
