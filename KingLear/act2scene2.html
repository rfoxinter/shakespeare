<p><center><i>[Enter Kent in disguise and Oswald, the Steward,</p>

<p>severally.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this</p>

<p>house?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Ay.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  Where may we set our horses?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  I’ th’ mire.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  Prithee, if thou lov’st me, tell me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  I love thee not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  Why then, I care not for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make</p>

<p>thee care for me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Fellow, I know thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  What dost thou know me for?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a</p>

<p>base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound,</p>

<p>filthy worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered,</p>

<p>action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, superserviceable,</p>

<p>finical rogue; one-trunk-inheriting</p>

<p>slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good</p>

<p>service, and art nothing but the composition of a</p>

<p>knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir</p>

<p>of a mongrel bitch; one whom I will beat into</p>

<p>clamorous whining if thou deny’st the least syllable</p>

<p>of thy addition.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou thus</p>

<p>to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor</p>

<p>knows thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  What a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou</p>

<p>knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up</p>

<p>thy heels and beat thee before the King? <i>[He draws</p>

<p>his sword.]</i> Draw, you rogue, for though it be night,</p>

<p>yet the moon shines. I’ll make a sop o’ th’ moonshine</p>

<p>of you, you whoreson, cullionly barbermonger.</p>

<p>Draw!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  Away! I have nothing to do with thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against</p>

<p>the King and take Vanity the puppet’s part against</p>

<p>the royalty of her father. Draw, you rogue, or I’ll so</p>

<p>carbonado your shanks! Draw, you rascal! Come</p>

<p>your ways.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  Help, ho! Murder! Help!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat</p>

<p>slave! Strike!     <i><i>[He beats Oswald.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  Help, ho! Murder, murder!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Bastard Edmund, with his rapier drawn,</p>

<p>Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span>  How now, what’s the matter? Part!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  With you, goodman boy, if you please. Come, I’ll</p>

<p>flesh you. Come on, young master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Weapons? Arms? What’s the matter here?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span>  Keep peace, upon your lives! He dies that</p>

<p>strikes again. What is the matter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Regan</span></p>

<p>The messengers from our sister and the King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span>  What is your difference? Speak.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  I am scarce in breath, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  No marvel, you have so bestirred your valor.</p>

<p>You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a</p>

<p>tailor made thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span>  Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a</p>

<p>man?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  A tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not</p>

<p>have made him so ill, though they had been but two</p>

<p>years o’ th’ trade.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span>  Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have</p>

<p>spared at suit of his gray beard–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Thou whoreson zed, thou unnecessary letter!</p>

<p>–My lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread</p>

<p>this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall</p>

<p>of a jakes with him.–Spare my gray beard, you</p>

<p>wagtail?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span>  Peace, sirrah!</p>

<p>You beastly knave, know you no reverence?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span>  Why art thou angry?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>That such a slave as this should wear a sword,</p>

<p>Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as</p>

<p>these,</p>

<p>Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain</p>

<p>Which are too intrinse t’ unloose; smooth every</p>

<p>passion</p>

<p>That in the natures of their lords rebel–</p>

<p>Being oil to fire, snow to the colder moods–</p>

<p>Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks</p>

<p>With every gale and vary of their masters,</p>

<p>Knowing naught, like dogs, but following.–</p>

<p>A plague upon your epileptic visage!</p>

<p>Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?</p>

<p>Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,</p>

<p>I’d drive you cackling home to Camelot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span>  What, art thou mad, old fellow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  How fell you out? Say that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>No contraries hold more antipathy</p>

<p>Than I and such a knave.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span></p>

<p>Why dost thou call him “knave”? What is his fault?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  His countenance likes me not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span></p>

<p>No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Sir, ’tis my occupation to be plain:</p>

<p>I have seen better faces in my time</p>

<p>Than stands on any shoulder that I see</p>

<p>Before me at this instant.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span>  This is some fellow</p>

<p>Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect</p>

<p>A saucy roughness and constrains the garb</p>

<p>Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he.</p>

<p>An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!</p>

<p>An they will take it, so; if not, he’s plain.</p>

<p>These kind of knaves I know, which in this</p>

<p>plainness</p>

<p>Harbor more craft and more corrupter ends</p>

<p>Than twenty silly-ducking observants</p>

<p>That stretch their duties nicely.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,</p>

<p>Under th’ allowance of your great aspect,</p>

<p>Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire</p>

<p>On flick’ring Phoebus’ front–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span>  What mean’st by this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  To go out of my dialect, which you discommend</p>

<p>so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that</p>

<p>beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave,</p>

<p>which for my part I will not be, though I should</p>

<p>win your displeasure to entreat me to ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span> <i>[to Oswald]</i>  What was th’ offense you gave</p>

<p>him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  I never gave him any.</p>

<p>It pleased the King his master very late</p>

<p>To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;</p>

<p>When he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,</p>

<p>Tripped me behind; being down, insulted, railed,</p>

<p>And put upon him such a deal of man</p>

<p>That worthied him, got praises of the King</p>

<p>For him attempting who was self-subdued;</p>

<p>And in the fleshment of this dread exploit,</p>

<p>Drew on me here again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  None of these rogues and cowards</p>

<p>But Ajax is their fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span>  Fetch forth the stocks.–</p>

<p>You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,</p>

<p>We’ll teach you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Sir, I am too old to learn.</p>

<p>Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King,</p>

<p>On whose employment I was sent to you.</p>

<p>You shall do small respect, show too bold</p>

<p>malice</p>

<p>Against the grace and person of my master,</p>

<p>Stocking his messenger.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span></p>

<p>Fetch forth the stocks.–As I have life and honor,</p>

<p>There shall he sit till noon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Regan</span></p>

<p>Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night, too.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog,</p>

<p>You should not use me so.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Regan</span>  Sir, being his knave, I will.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span></p>

<p>This is a fellow of the selfsame color</p>

<p>Our sister speaks of.–Come, bring away the stocks.</p>

<p><center><i>[Stocks brought out.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.</p>

<p>His fault is much, and the good king his master</p>

<p>Will check him for ’t. Your purposed low correction</p>

<p>Is such as basest and contemned’st wretches</p>

<p>For pilf’rings and most common trespasses</p>

<p>Are punished with. The King must take it ill</p>

<p>That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,</p>

<p>Should have him thus restrained.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span>  I’ll answer that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Regan</span></p>

<p>My sister may receive it much more worse</p>

<p>To have her gentleman abused, assaulted</p>

<p>For following her affairs.–Put in his legs.</p>

<p><center><i>[Kent is put in the stocks.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Cornwall</span>  Come, my good lord, away.</p>

<p><center><i>[All but Gloucester and Kent exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>I am sorry for thee, friend. ’Tis the Duke’s</p>

<p>pleasure,</p>

<p>Whose disposition all the world well knows</p>

<p>Will not be rubbed nor stopped. I’ll entreat for thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Pray, do not, sir. I have watched and traveled hard.</p>

<p>Some time I shall sleep out; the rest I’ll whistle.</p>

<p>A good man’s fortune may grow out at heels.</p>

<p>Give you good morrow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span></p>

<p>The Duke’s to blame in this. ’Twill be ill taken.</p>

<p><center><i>[He exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Good king, that must approve the common saw,</p>

<p>Thou out of heaven’s benediction com’st</p>

<p>To the warm sun.     <i><i>[He takes out a paper.]</i></i></p>

<p>Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,</p>

<p>That by thy comfortable beams I may</p>

<p>Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles</p>

<p>But misery. I know ’tis from Cordelia,</p>

<p>Who hath most fortunately been informed</p>

<p>Of my obscured course, and shall find time</p>

<p>From this enormous state, seeking to give</p>

<p>Losses their remedies. All weary and o’erwatched,</p>

<p>Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold</p>

<p>This shameful lodging.</p>

<p>Fortune, good night. Smile once more; turn thy</p>

<p>wheel.</p>

<p><center><i>[Sleeps.]</i></center></p>
