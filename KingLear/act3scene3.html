<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this</p>

<p>unnatural dealing. When I desired their leave that I</p>

<p>might pity him, they took from me the use of mine</p>

<p>own house, charged me on pain of perpetual</p>

<p>displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for</p>

<p>him, or any way sustain him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  Most savage and unnatural.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gloucester</sc>  Go to; say you nothing. There is division</p>

<p>between the dukes, and a worse matter than that. I</p>

<p>have received a letter this night; ’tis dangerous to</p>

<p>be spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet.</p>

<p>These injuries the King now bears will be revenged</p>

<p>home; there is part of a power already footed. We</p>

<p>must incline to the King. I will look him and privily</p>

<p>relieve him. Go you and maintain talk with the</p>

<p>Duke, that my charity be not of him perceived. If he</p>

<p>ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed. If I die for it, as</p>

<p>no less is threatened me, the King my old master</p>

<p>must be relieved. There is strange things toward,</p>

<p>Edmund. Pray you, be careful.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>This courtesy forbid thee shall the Duke</p>

<p>Instantly know, and of that letter too.</p>

<p>This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me</p>

<p>That which my father loses–no less than all.</p>

<p>The younger rises when the old doth fall.</p>
