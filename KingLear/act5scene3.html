<p><center><i>[Enter in conquest, with Drum and Colors, Edmund;</p>

<p>Lear and Cordelia as prisoners; Soldiers, Captain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>Some officers take them away. Good guard</p>

<p>Until their greater pleasures first be known</p>

<p>That are to censure them.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Cordelia</sc> <i>[to Lear]</i>  We are not the first</p>

<p>Who with best meaning have incurred the worst.</p>

<p>For thee, oppressed king, I am cast down.</p>

<p>Myself could else outfrown false Fortune’s frown.</p>

<p>Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>No, no, no, no. Come, let’s away to prison.</p>

<p>We two alone will sing like birds i’ th’ cage.</p>

<p>When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel down</p>

<p>And ask of thee forgiveness. So we’ll live,</p>

<p>And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh</p>

<p>At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues</p>

<p>Talk of court news, and we’ll talk with them too–</p>

<p>Who loses and who wins; who’s in, who’s out–</p>

<p>And take upon ’s the mystery of things,</p>

<p>As if we were God’s spies. And we’ll wear out,</p>

<p>In a walled prison, packs and sects of great ones</p>

<p>That ebb and flow by th’ moon.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  Take them away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,</p>

<p>The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught</p>

<p>thee?</p>

<p>He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven</p>

<p>And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.</p>

<p>The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell,</p>

<p>Ere they shall make us weep. We’ll see ’em starved</p>

<p>first.</p>

<p>Come.</p>

<p><center><i>[Lear and Cordelia exit, with Soldiers.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  Come hither, captain. Hark.</p>

<p><center><i>[Handing him a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>Take thou this note. Go follow them to prison.</p>

<p>One step I have advanced thee. If thou dost</p>

<p>As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way</p>

<p>To noble fortunes. Know thou this: that men</p>

<p>Are as the time is; to be tender-minded</p>

<p>Does not become a sword. Thy great employment</p>

<p>Will not bear question. Either say thou ’lt do ’t,</p>

<p>Or thrive by other means.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc>  I’ll do ’t, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>About it, and write “happy” when th’ hast done.</p>

<p>Mark, I say, instantly, and carry it so</p>

<p>As I have set it down.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc></p>

<p>I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats.</p>

<p>If it be man’s work, I’ll do ’t.     <i><i>[Captain exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Soldiers and a</p>

<p>Captain.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc> <i>[to Edmund]</i></p>

<p>Sir, you have showed today your valiant strain,</p>

<p>And Fortune led you well. You have the captives</p>

<p>Who were the opposites of this day’s strife.</p>

<p>I do require them of you, so to use them</p>

<p>As we shall find their merits and our safety</p>

<p>May equally determine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  Sir, I thought it fit</p>

<p>To send the old and miserable king</p>

<p>To some retention and appointed guard,</p>

<p>Whose age had charms in it, whose title more,</p>

<p>To pluck the common bosom on his side</p>

<p>And turn our impressed lances in our eyes,</p>

<p>Which do command them. With him I sent the</p>

<p>Queen,</p>

<p>My reason all the same, and they are ready</p>

<p>Tomorrow, or at further space, t’ appear</p>

<p>Where you shall hold your session. At this time</p>

<p>We sweat and bleed. The friend hath lost his friend,</p>

<p>And the best quarrels in the heat are cursed</p>

<p>By those that feel their sharpness.</p>

<p>The question of Cordelia and her father</p>

<p>Requires a fitter place.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  Sir, by your patience,</p>

<p>I hold you but a subject of this war,</p>

<p>Not as a brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  That’s as we list to grace him.</p>

<p>Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded</p>

<p>Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,</p>

<p>Bore the commission of my place and person,</p>

<p>The which immediacy may well stand up</p>

<p>And call itself your brother.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  Not so hot.</p>

<p>In his own grace he doth exalt himself</p>

<p>More than in your addition.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  In my rights,</p>

<p>By me invested, he compeers the best.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc></p>

<p>That were the most if he should husband you.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>Jesters do oft prove prophets.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  Holla, holla!</p>

<p>That eye that told you so looked but asquint.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc></p>

<p>Lady, I am not well, else I should answer</p>

<p>From a full-flowing stomach. <i>[To Edmund.]</i></p>

<p>General,</p>

<p>Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony.</p>

<p>Dispose of them, of me; the walls is thine.</p>

<p>Witness the world that I create thee here</p>

<p>My lord and master.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  Mean you to enjoy him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc></p>

<p>The let-alone lies not in your goodwill.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>Nor in thine, lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  Half-blooded fellow, yes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc> <i>[to Edmund]</i></p>

<p>Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc></p>

<p>Stay yet, hear reason.–Edmund, I arrest thee</p>

<p>On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,</p>

<p>This gilded serpent.–For your claim, fair</p>

<p>sister,</p>

<p>I bar it in the interest of my wife.</p>

<p>’Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,</p>

<p>And I, her husband, contradict your banns.</p>

<p>If you will marry, make your loves to me.</p>

<p>My lady is bespoke.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  An interlude!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc></p>

<p>Thou art armed, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.</p>

<p>If none appear to prove upon thy person</p>

<p>Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,</p>

<p>There is my pledge.     <i><i>[He throws down a glove.]</i></i></p>

<p>I’ll make it on thy heart,</p>

<p>Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less</p>

<p>Than I have here proclaimed thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  Sick, O, sick!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc> <i>[aside]</i>  If not, I’ll ne’er trust medicine.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>There’s my exchange.     <i><i>[He throws down a glove.]</i></i></p>

<p>What in the world he is</p>

<p>That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.</p>

<p>Call by the trumpet. He that dares approach,</p>

<p>On him, on you, who not, I will maintain</p>

<p>My truth and honor firmly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc></p>

<p>A herald, ho!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  A herald, ho, a herald!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc></p>

<p>Trust to thy single virtue, for thy soldiers,</p>

<p>All levied in my name, have in my name</p>

<p>Took their discharge.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Regan</sc>  My sickness grows upon me.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc></p>

<p>She is not well. Convey her to my tent.</p>

<p><center><i>[Regan is helped to exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Herald.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,</p>

<p>And read out this.     <i><i>[He hands the Herald a paper.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Captain</sc>  Sound, trumpet!</p>

<p><center><i>[A trumpet sounds.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Herald</sc> <i>[reads.]</i></p>

<p>If any man of quality or degree, within the lists of the</p>

<p>army, will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of</p>

<p>Gloucester, that he is a manifold traitor, let him</p>

<p>appear by the third sound of the trumpet. He is bold in</p>

<p>his defense.     <i><i>[First trumpet sounds.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Herald</sc>  Again!     <i><i>[Second trumpet sounds.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Herald</sc>  Again!     <i><i>[Third trumpet sounds.]</i></i></p>

<p><center><i>[Trumpet answers within.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Edgar armed.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc> <i>[to Herald]</i></p>

<p>Ask him his purposes, why he appears</p>

<p>Upon this call o’ th’ trumpet.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Herald</sc>  What are you?</p>

<p>Your name, your quality, and why you answer</p>

<p>This present summons?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Know my name is lost,</p>

<p>By treason’s tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.</p>

<p>Yet am I noble as the adversary</p>

<p>I come to cope.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  Which is that adversary?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>What’s he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of</p>

<p>Gloucester?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>Himself. What sayest thou to him?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Draw thy sword,</p>

<p>That if my speech offend a noble heart,</p>

<p>Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.</p>

<p><center><i>[He draws his sword.]</i></center></p>

<p>Behold, it is my privilege, the privilege of mine</p>

<p>honors,</p>

<p>My oath, and my profession. I protest,</p>

<p>Maugre thy strength, place, youth, and eminence,</p>

<p>Despite thy victor-sword and fire-new fortune,</p>

<p>Thy valor, and thy heart, thou art a traitor,</p>

<p>False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father,</p>

<p>Conspirant ’gainst this high illustrious prince,</p>

<p>And from th’ extremest upward of thy head</p>

<p>To the descent and dust below thy foot,</p>

<p>A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou “no,”</p>

<p>This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent</p>

<p>To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,</p>

<p>Thou liest.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  In wisdom I should ask thy name,</p>

<p>But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,</p>

<p>And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,</p>

<p>What safe and nicely I might well delay</p>

<p>By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.</p>

<p>Back do I toss these treasons to thy head,</p>

<p>With the hell-hated lie o’erwhelm thy heart,</p>

<p>Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,</p>

<p>This sword of mine shall give them instant way,</p>

<p>Where they shall rest forever. Trumpets, speak!</p>

<p><center><i>[He draws his sword. Alarums. Fights.]</i></center></p>

<p><center><i>[Edmund falls, wounded.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc> <i>[to Edgar]</i></p>

<p>Save him, save him!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  This is practice, Gloucester.</p>

<p>By th’ law of war, thou wast not bound to answer</p>

<p>An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquished,</p>

<p>But cozened and beguiled.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  Shut your mouth, dame,</p>

<p>Or with this paper shall I stopple it.–Hold, sir.–</p>

<p>Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.</p>

<p>No tearing, lady. I perceive you know it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc></p>

<p>Say if I do; the laws are mine, not thine.</p>

<p>Who can arraign me for ’t?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  Most monstrous! O!</p>

<p>Know’st thou this paper?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  Ask me not what I know.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc></p>

<p>Go after her, she’s desperate. Govern her.</p>

<p><center><i>[A Soldier exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc> <i>[to Edgar]</i></p>

<p>What you have charged me with, that have I done,</p>

<p>And more, much more. The time will bring it out.</p>

<p>’Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou</p>

<p>That hast this fortune on me? If thou ’rt noble,</p>

<p>I do forgive thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Let’s exchange charity.</p>

<p>I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;</p>

<p>If more, the more th’ hast wronged me.</p>

<p>My name is Edgar and thy father’s son.</p>

<p>The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices</p>

<p>Make instruments to plague us.</p>

<p>The dark and vicious place where thee he got</p>

<p>Cost him his eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  Th’ hast spoken right. ’Tis true.</p>

<p>The wheel is come full circle; I am here.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc> <i>[to Edgar]</i></p>

<p>Methought thy very gait did prophesy</p>

<p>A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.</p>

<p>Let sorrow split my heart if ever I</p>

<p>Did hate thee or thy father!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Worthy prince, I know ’t.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  Where have you hid yourself?</p>

<p>How have you known the miseries of your father?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale,</p>

<p>And when ’tis told, O, that my heart would burst!</p>

<p>The bloody proclamation to escape</p>

<p>That followed me so near–O, our lives’ sweetness,</p>

<p>That we the pain of death would hourly die</p>

<p>Rather than die at once!–taught me to shift</p>

<p>Into a madman’s rags, t’ assume a semblance</p>

<p>That very dogs disdained, and in this habit</p>

<p>Met I my father with his bleeding rings,</p>

<p>Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,</p>

<p>Led him, begged for him, saved him from despair.</p>

<p>Never–O fault!–revealed myself unto him</p>

<p>Until some half hour past, when I was armed.</p>

<p>Not sure, though hoping of this good success,</p>

<p>I asked his blessing, and from first to last</p>

<p>Told him our pilgrimage. But his flawed heart</p>

<p>(Alack, too weak the conflict to support)</p>

<p>’Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,</p>

<p>Burst smilingly.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  This speech of yours hath moved me,</p>

<p>And shall perchance do good. But speak you on.</p>

<p>You look as you had something more to say.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc></p>

<p>If there be more, more woeful, hold it in,</p>

<p>For I am almost ready to dissolve,</p>

<p>Hearing of this.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  This would have seemed a period</p>

<p>To such as love not sorrow; but another,</p>

<p>To amplify too much, would make much more</p>

<p>And top extremity. Whilst I</p>

<p>Was big in clamor, came there in a man</p>

<p>Who, having seen me in my worst estate,</p>

<p>Shunned my abhorred society; but then, finding</p>

<p>Who ’twas that so endured, with his strong arms</p>

<p>He fastened on my neck and bellowed out</p>

<p>As he’d burst heaven, threw him on my father,</p>

<p>Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him</p>

<p>That ever ear received, which, in recounting,</p>

<p>His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life</p>

<p>Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,</p>

<p>And there I left him tranced.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  But who was this?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>Kent, sir, the banished Kent, who in disguise</p>

<p>Followed his enemy king and did him service</p>

<p>Improper for a slave.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Help, help, O, help!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  What kind of help?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc> <i>[to Gentleman]</i>  Speak, man!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  What means this bloody knife?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>’Tis hot, it smokes! It came even from the heart</p>

<p>Of–O, she’s dead!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  Who dead? Speak, man.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>Your lady, sir, your lady. And her sister</p>

<p>By her is poisoned. She confesses it.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>I was contracted to them both. All three</p>

<p>Now marry in an instant.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Here comes Kent.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Kent.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc> <i>[to the Gentleman]</i></p>

<p>Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead.</p>

<p><center><i>[Gentleman exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>This judgment of the heavens, that makes us</p>

<p>tremble,</p>

<p>Touches us not with pity. O, is this he?</p>

<p><i>[To Kent.]</i> The time will not allow the compliment</p>

<p>Which very manners urges.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  I am come</p>

<p>To bid my king and master aye goodnight.</p>

<p>Is he not here?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  Great thing of us forgot!</p>

<p>Speak, Edmund, where’s the King? And where’s</p>

<p>Cordelia?</p>

<p><center><i>[Goneril and Regan’s bodies brought out.]</i></center></p>

<p>Seest thou this object, Kent?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Alack, why thus?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc>  Yet Edmund was beloved.</p>

<p>The one the other poisoned for my sake,</p>

<p>And after slew herself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  Even so.–Cover their faces.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>I pant for life. Some good I mean to do</p>

<p>Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send–</p>

<p>Be brief in it–to th’ castle, for my writ</p>

<p>Is on the life of Lear, and on Cordelia.</p>

<p>Nay, send in time.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  Run, run, O, run!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>To who, my lord? <i>[To Edmund.]</i> Who has the office?</p>

<p>Send</p>

<p>Thy token of reprieve.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc></p>

<p>Well thought on. Take my sword. Give it the</p>

<p>Captain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc> <i>[to a Soldier]</i>  Haste thee for thy life.</p>

<p><center><i>[The Soldier exits with Edmund’s sword.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edmund</sc> <i>[to Albany]</i></p>

<p>He hath commission from thy wife and me</p>

<p>To hang Cordelia in the prison, and</p>

<p>To lay the blame upon her own despair,</p>

<p>That she fordid herself.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc></p>

<p>The gods defend her!–Bear him hence awhile.</p>

<p><center><i>[Edmund is carried off.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lear with Cordelia in his arms,</p>

<p>followed by a Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones!</p>

<p>Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so</p>

<p>That heaven’s vault should crack. She’s gone</p>

<p>forever.</p>

<p>I know when one is dead and when one lives.</p>

<p>She’s dead as earth.–Lend me a looking glass.</p>

<p>If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,</p>

<p>Why, then she lives.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  Is this the promised end?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>Or image of that horror?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  Fall and cease.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>This feather stirs. She lives. If it be so,</p>

<p>It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows</p>

<p>That ever I have felt.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  O, my good master–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>Prithee, away.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  ’Tis noble Kent, your friend.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!</p>

<p>I might have saved her. Now she’s gone forever.–</p>

<p>Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little. Ha!</p>

<p>What is ’t thou sayst?–Her voice was ever soft,</p>

<p>Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.</p>

<p>I killed the slave that was a-hanging thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Gentleman</sc></p>

<p>’Tis true, my lords, he did.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Did I not, fellow?</p>

<p>I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion</p>

<p>I would have made him skip. I am old now,</p>

<p>And these same crosses spoil me. <i>[To Kent.]</i> Who</p>

<p>are you?</p>

<p>Mine eyes are not o’ th’ best. I’ll tell you straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>If Fortune brag of two she loved and hated,</p>

<p>One of them we behold.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc>  The same,</p>

<p>Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that.</p>

<p>He’ll strike and quickly too. He’s dead and rotten.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>No, my good lord, I am the very man–</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  I’ll see that straight.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>That from your first of difference and decay</p>

<p>Have followed your sad steps.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  You are welcome</p>

<p>hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>Nor no man else. All’s cheerless, dark, and deadly.</p>

<p>Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,</p>

<p>And desperately are dead.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc>  Ay, so I think.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc></p>

<p>He knows not what he says, and vain is it</p>

<p>That we present us to him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Very bootless.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Messenger</sc>  Edmund is dead, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc>  That’s but a trifle here.–</p>

<p>You lords and noble friends, know our intent:</p>

<p>What comfort to this great decay may come</p>

<p>Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,</p>

<p>During the life of this old Majesty,</p>

<p>To him our absolute power; you to your rights,</p>

<p>With boot and such addition as your Honors</p>

<p>Have more than merited. All friends shall taste</p>

<p>The wages of their virtue, and all foes</p>

<p>The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Lear</sc></p>

<p>And my poor fool is hanged. No, no, no life?</p>

<p>Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,</p>

<p>And thou no breath at all? Thou ’lt come no more,</p>

<p>Never, never, never, never, never.–</p>

<p>Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,</p>

<p>Look there, look there!     <i><i>[He dies.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  He faints. <i>[To Lear.]</i> My lord,</p>

<p>my lord!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>Break, heart, I prithee, break!</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  Look up, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him</p>

<p>That would upon the rack of this tough world</p>

<p>Stretch him out longer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc>  He is gone indeed.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>The wonder is he hath endured so long.</p>

<p>He but usurped his life.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Albany</sc></p>

<p>Bear them from hence. Our present business</p>

<p>Is general woe. <i>[To Edgar and Kent.]</i> Friends of my</p>

<p>soul, you twain</p>

<p>Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Kent</sc></p>

<p>I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;</p>

<p>My master calls me. I must not say no.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Edgar</sc></p>

<p>The weight of this sad time we must obey,</p>

<p>Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.</p>

<p>The oldest hath borne most; we that are young</p>

<p>Shall never see so much nor live so long.</p>
