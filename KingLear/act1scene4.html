<p><center><i>[Enter Kent in disguise.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>If but as well I other accents borrow</p>

<p>That can my speech diffuse, my good intent</p>

<p>May carry through itself to that full issue</p>

<p>For which I razed my likeness. Now, banished Kent,</p>

<p>If thou canst serve where thou dost stand</p>

<p>condemned,</p>

<p>So may it come thy master, whom thou lov’st,</p>

<p>Shall find thee full of labors.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Horns within. Enter Lear, Knights, and Attendants.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Let me not stay a jot for dinner. Go get it ready.</p>

<p><center><i>[An Attendant exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>How now, what art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  A man, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with</p>

<p>us?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve</p>

<p>him truly that will put me in trust, to love him that</p>

<p>is honest, to converse with him that is wise and says</p>

<p>little, to fear judgment, to fight when I cannot</p>

<p>choose, and to eat no fish.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  What art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the</p>

<p>King.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  If thou be’st as poor for a subject as he’s for a</p>

<p>king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Service.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Who wouldst thou serve?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  You.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Dost thou know me, fellow?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  No, sir, but you have that in your countenance</p>

<p>which I would fain call master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  What’s that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Authority.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  What services canst do?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a</p>

<p>curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message</p>

<p>bluntly. That which ordinary men are fit for I</p>

<p>am qualified in, and the best of me is diligence.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  How old art thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing,</p>

<p>nor so old to dote on her for anything. I have years</p>

<p>on my back forty-eight.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Follow me. Thou shalt serve me–if I like thee</p>

<p>no worse after dinner. I will not part from thee</p>

<p>yet.–Dinner, ho, dinner!–Where’s my knave, my</p>

<p>Fool? Go you and call my Fool hither.</p>

<p><center><i>[An Attendant exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Oswald, the Steward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>You, you, sirrah, where’s my daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  So please you–     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  What says the fellow there? Call the clotpole</p>

<p>back. <i>[A Knight exits.]</i> Where’s my Fool? Ho! I think</p>

<p>the world’s asleep.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Knight again.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now? Where’s that mongrel?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Knight</span>  He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Why came not the slave back to me when I</p>

<p>called him?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Knight</span>  Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner,</p>

<p>he would not.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  He would not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Knight</span>  My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to</p>

<p>my judgment your Highness is not entertained</p>

<p>with that ceremonious affection as you were wont.</p>

<p>There’s a great abatement of kindness appears as</p>

<p>well in the general dependents as in the Duke</p>

<p>himself also, and your daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Ha? Sayst thou so?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Knight</span>  I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be</p>

<p>mistaken, for my duty cannot be silent when I think</p>

<p>your Highness wronged.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Thou but remembrest me of mine own conception.</p>

<p>I have perceived a most faint neglect of late,</p>

<p>which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous</p>

<p>curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of</p>

<p>unkindness. I will look further into ’t. But where’s</p>

<p>my Fool? I have not seen him this two days.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Knight</span>  Since my young lady’s going into France, sir,</p>

<p>the Fool hath much pined away.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  No more of that. I have noted it well.–Go you</p>

<p>and tell my daughter I would speak with her. <i>[An</p>

<p>Attendant exits.]</i> Go you call hither my Fool.</p>

<p><center><i>[Another exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Oswald, the Steward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>O you, sir, you, come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  My lady’s father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  “My lady’s father”? My lord’s knave! You whoreson</p>

<p>dog, you slave, you cur!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  I am none of these, my lord, I beseech your</p>

<p>pardon.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?</p>

<p><center><i>[Lear strikes him.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  I’ll not be strucken, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span> <i>[tripping him]</i>  Nor tripped neither, you base</p>

<p>football player?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv’st me, and I’ll</p>

<p>love thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span> <i>[to Oswald]</i>  Come, sir, arise. Away. I’ll teach you</p>

<p>differences. Away, away. If you will measure your</p>

<p>lubber’s length again, tarry. But away. Go to. Have</p>

<p>you wisdom? So.     <i><i>[Oswald exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There’s</p>

<p>earnest of thy service.     <i><i>[He gives Kent a purse.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Let me hire him too. <i>[To Kent.]</i> Here’s my</p>

<p>coxcomb.     <i><i>[He offers Kent his cap.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  How now, my pretty knave, how dost thou?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[to Kent]</i>  Sirrah, you were best take my</p>

<p>coxcomb.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Why, my boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Why? For taking one’s part that’s out of favor.</p>

<p><i>[To Kent.]</i> Nay, an thou canst not smile as the</p>

<p>wind sits, thou ’lt catch cold shortly. There, take my</p>

<p>coxcomb. Why, this fellow has banished two on ’s</p>

<p>daughters and did the third a blessing against his</p>

<p>will. If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my</p>

<p>coxcomb.–How now, nuncle? Would I had two</p>

<p>coxcombs and two daughters.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Why, my boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  If I gave them all my living, I’d keep my coxcombs</p>

<p>myself. There’s mine. Beg another of thy</p>

<p>daughters.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Take heed, sirrah–the whip.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Truth’s a dog must to kennel; he must be</p>

<p>whipped out, when the Lady Brach may stand by th’</p>

<p>fire and stink.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  A pestilent gall to me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Sirrah, I’ll teach thee a speech.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Do.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Mark it, nuncle:</p>

<p>     <i>Have more than thou showest.</i></p>

<p>     <i>Speak less than thou knowest,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Lend less than thou owest,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Ride more than thou goest,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Learn more than thou trowest,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Set less than thou throwest;</i></p>

<p>     <i>Leave thy drink and thy whore</i></p>

<p>     <i>And keep in-a-door,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And thou shalt have more</i></p>

<p>     <i>Than two tens to a score.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  This is nothing, Fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer.</p>

<p>You gave me nothing for ’t.–Can you make no use</p>

<p>of nothing, nuncle?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Why no, boy. Nothing can be made out of</p>

<p>nothing.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span> <i>[to Kent]</i>  Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his</p>

<p>land comes to. He will not believe a Fool.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  A bitter Fool!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Dost know the difference, my boy, between a</p>

<p>bitter fool and a sweet one?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  No, lad, teach me.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>     <i>That lord that counseled thee</i></p>

<p>        <i>To give away thy land,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Come place him here by me;</i></p>

<p>        <i>Do thou for him stand.</i></p>

<p>     <i>The sweet and bitter fool</i></p>

<p>        <i>Will presently appear:</i></p>

<p>     <i>The one in motley here,</i></p>

<p>        <i>The other found out there.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Dost thou call me “fool,” boy?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  All thy other titles thou hast given away. That</p>

<p>thou wast born with.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  This is not altogether fool, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  No, faith, lords and great men will not let me. If</p>

<p>I had a monopoly out, they would have part on ’t.</p>

<p>And ladies too, they will not let me have all the fool</p>

<p>to myself; they’ll be snatching.–Nuncle, give me</p>

<p>an egg, and I’ll give thee two crowns.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  What two crowns shall they be?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Why, after I have cut the egg i’ th’ middle and eat</p>

<p>up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou</p>

<p>clovest thy crown i’ th’ middle and gav’st away</p>

<p>both parts, thou bor’st thine ass on thy back o’er</p>

<p>the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown</p>

<p>when thou gav’st thy golden one away. If I speak</p>

<p>like myself in this, let him be whipped that first</p>

<p>finds it so. <i>[Sings.]</i></p>

<p>     <i>Fools had ne’er less grace in a year,</i></p>

<p>        <i>For wise men are grown foppish</i></p>

<p>     <i>And know not how their wits to wear,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Their manners are so apish.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  When were you wont to be so full of songs,</p>

<p>sirrah?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I have used it, nuncle, e’er since thou mad’st thy</p>

<p>daughters thy mothers. For when thou gav’st them</p>

<p>the rod and put’st down thine own breeches,</p>

<p><center><i>[Sings.]</i></center></p>

<p>     <i>Then they for sudden joy did weep,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And I for sorrow sung,</i></p>

<p>     <i>That such a king should play bo-peep</i></p>

<p>        <i>And go the fools among.</i></p>

<p>Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach</p>

<p>thy Fool to lie. I would fain learn to lie.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  An you lie, sirrah, we’ll have you whipped.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are.</p>

<p>They’ll have me whipped for speaking true, thou ’lt</p>

<p>have me whipped for lying, and sometimes I am</p>

<p>whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any</p>

<p>kind o’ thing than a Fool. And yet I would not be</p>

<p>thee, nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o’ both sides</p>

<p>and left nothing i’ th’ middle. Here comes one o’ the</p>

<p>parings.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Goneril.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on?</p>

<p>Methinks you are too much of late i’ th’ frown.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no</p>

<p>need to care for her frowning. Now thou art an O</p>

<p>without a figure. I am better than thou art now. I</p>

<p>am a Fool. Thou art nothing. <i>[To Goneril.]</i> Yes,</p>

<p>forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your face bids</p>

<p>me, though you say nothing.</p>

<p>     <i>Mum, mum,</i></p>

<p>     <i>He that keeps nor crust nor crumb,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Weary of all, shall want some.</i></p>

<p><center><i>[He points at Lear.]</i></center></p>

<p>That’s a shelled peascod.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span></p>

<p>Not only, sir, this your all-licensed Fool,</p>

<p>But other of your insolent retinue</p>

<p>Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth</p>

<p>In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,</p>

<p>I had thought by making this well known unto you</p>

<p>To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,</p>

<p>By what yourself too late have spoke and done,</p>

<p>That you protect this course and put it on</p>

<p>By your allowance; which if you should, the fault</p>

<p>Would not ’scape censure, nor the redresses sleep</p>

<p>Which in the tender of a wholesome weal</p>

<p>Might in their working do you that offense,</p>

<p>Which else were shame, that then necessity</p>

<p>Will call discreet proceeding.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  For you know, nuncle,</p>

<p>     <i>The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,</i></p>

<p>     <i>That it’s had it head bit off by it young.</i></p>

<p>So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Are you our daughter?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span></p>

<p>I would you would make use of your good wisdom,</p>

<p>Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away</p>

<p>These dispositions which of late transport you</p>

<p>From what you rightly are.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  May not an ass know when the cart draws the</p>

<p>horse? Whoop, Jug, I love thee!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>Does any here know me? This is not Lear.</p>

<p>Does Lear walk thus, speak thus? Where are his</p>

<p>eyes?</p>

<p>Either his notion weakens, his discernings</p>

<p>Are lethargied–Ha! Waking? ’Tis not so.</p>

<p>Who is it that can tell me who I am?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Lear’s shadow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>I would learn that, for, by the marks of</p>

<p>sovereignty,</p>

<p>Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded</p>

<p>I had daughters.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Which they will make an obedient father.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Your name, fair gentlewoman?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span></p>

<p>This admiration, sir, is much o’ th’ savor</p>

<p>Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you</p>

<p>To understand my purposes aright.</p>

<p>As you are old and reverend, should be wise.</p>

<p>Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires,</p>

<p>Men so disordered, so debauched and bold,</p>

<p>That this our court, infected with their manners,</p>

<p>Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust</p>

<p>Makes it more like a tavern or a brothel</p>

<p>Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak</p>

<p>For instant remedy. Be then desired,</p>

<p>By her that else will take the thing she begs,</p>

<p>A little to disquantity your train,</p>

<p>And the remainders that shall still depend</p>

<p>To be such men as may besort your age,</p>

<p>Which know themselves and you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Darkness and</p>

<p>devils!–</p>

<p>Saddle my horses. Call my train together.</p>

<p><center><i>[Some exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Degenerate bastard, I’ll not trouble thee.</p>

<p>Yet have I left a daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span></p>

<p>You strike my people, and your disordered rabble</p>

<p>Make servants of their betters.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Albany.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>Woe that too late repents!–O, sir, are you</p>

<p>come?</p>

<p>Is it your will? Speak, sir.–Prepare my horses.</p>

<p><center><i>[Some exit.]</i></center></p>

<p>Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,</p>

<p>More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child</p>

<p>Than the sea monster!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span>  Pray, sir, be patient.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span> <i>[to Goneril]</i>  Detested kite, thou liest.</p>

<p>My train are men of choice and rarest parts,</p>

<p>That all particulars of duty know</p>

<p>And in the most exact regard support</p>

<p>The worships of their name. O most small fault,</p>

<p>How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show,</p>

<p>Which, like an engine, wrenched my frame of</p>

<p>nature</p>

<p>From the fixed place, drew from my heart all love</p>

<p>And added to the gall! O Lear, Lear, Lear!</p>

<p><center><i>[He strikes his head.]</i></center></p>

<p>Beat at this gate that let thy folly in</p>

<p>And thy dear judgment out. Go, go, my people.</p>

<p><center><i>[Some exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span></p>

<p>My lord, I am guiltless as I am ignorant</p>

<p>Of what hath moved you.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  It may be so, my lord.–</p>

<p>Hear, Nature, hear, dear goddess, hear!</p>

<p>Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend</p>

<p>To make this creature fruitful.</p>

<p>Into her womb convey sterility.</p>

<p>Dry up in her the organs of increase,</p>

<p>And from her derogate body never spring</p>

<p>A babe to honor her. If she must teem,</p>

<p>Create her child of spleen, that it may live</p>

<p>And be a thwart disnatured torment to her.</p>

<p>Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,</p>

<p>With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,</p>

<p>Turn all her mother’s pains and benefits</p>

<p>To laughter and contempt, that she may feel</p>

<p>How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is</p>

<p>To have a thankless child.–Away, away!</p>

<p><center><i>[Lear and the rest of his train exit.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span></p>

<p>Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span></p>

<p>Never afflict yourself to know more of it,</p>

<p>But let his disposition have that scope</p>

<p>As dotage gives it.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Lear and the Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>What, fifty of my followers at a clap?</p>

<p>Within a fortnight?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span>  What’s the matter, sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>I’ll tell thee. <i>[To Goneril.]</i> Life and death! I am</p>

<p>ashamed</p>

<p>That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus,</p>

<p>That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,</p>

<p>Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon</p>

<p>thee!</p>

<p>Th’ untented woundings of a father’s curse</p>

<p>Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,</p>

<p>Beweep this cause again, I’ll pluck you out</p>

<p>And cast you, with the waters that you loose,</p>

<p>To temper clay. Yea, is ’t come to this?</p>

<p>Ha! Let it be so. I have another daughter</p>

<p>Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable.</p>

<p>When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails</p>

<p>She’ll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find</p>

<p>That I’ll resume the shape which thou dost think</p>

<p>I have cast off forever.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span>  Do you mark that?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span></p>

<p>I cannot be so partial, Goneril,</p>

<p>To the great love I bear you–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span>  Pray you, content.–What, Oswald, ho!–</p>

<p>You, sir, more knave than Fool, after your master.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Nuncle Lear, Nuncle Lear, tarry. Take the Fool</p>

<p>with thee.</p>

<p>     <i>A fox, when one has caught her,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And such a daughter,</i></p>

<p>     <i>Should sure to the slaughter,</i></p>

<p>     <i>If my cap would buy a halter.</i></p>

<p>     So the Fool follows after.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span></p>

<p>This man hath had good counsel. A hundred</p>

<p>knights!</p>

<p>’Tis politic and safe to let him keep</p>

<p>At point a hundred knights! Yes, that on every</p>

<p>dream,</p>

<p>Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,</p>

<p>He may enguard his dotage with their powers</p>

<p>And hold our lives in mercy.–Oswald, I say!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span>  Well, you may fear too far.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span>  Safer than trust too far.</p>

<p>Let me still take away the harms I fear,</p>

<p>Not fear still to be taken. I know his heart.</p>

<p>What he hath uttered I have writ my sister.</p>

<p>If she sustain him and his hundred knights</p>

<p>When I have showed th’ unfitness–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Oswald, the Steward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>How now, Oswald?</p>

<p>What, have you writ that letter to my sister?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  Ay, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span></p>

<p>Take you some company and away to horse.</p>

<p>Inform her full of my particular fear,</p>

<p>And thereto add such reasons of your own</p>

<p>As may compact it more. Get you gone,</p>

<p>And hasten your return. <i>[Oswald exits.]</i> No, no, my</p>

<p>lord,</p>

<p>This milky gentleness and course of yours,</p>

<p>Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,</p>

<p>You are much more at task for want of wisdom</p>

<p>Than praised for harmful mildness.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span></p>

<p>How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.</p>

<p>Striving to better, oft we mar what’s well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span>  Nay, then–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span>  Well, well, th’ event.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
