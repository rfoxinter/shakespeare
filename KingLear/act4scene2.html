<p><center><i>[Enter Goneril and Edmund, the Bastard.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span></p>

<p>Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband</p>

<p>Not met us on the way.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Oswald, the Steward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Now, where’s your master?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span></p>

<p>Madam, within, but never man so changed.</p>

<p>I told him of the army that was landed;</p>

<p>He smiled at it. I told him you were coming;</p>

<p>His answer was “The worse.” Of Gloucester’s</p>

<p>treachery</p>

<p>And of the loyal service of his son</p>

<p>When I informed him, then he called me “sot”</p>

<p>And told me I had turned the wrong side out.</p>

<p>What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;</p>

<p>What like, offensive.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span> <i>[to Edmund]</i>  Then shall you go no further.</p>

<p>It is the cowish terror of his spirit,</p>

<p>That dares not undertake. He’ll not feel wrongs</p>

<p>Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way</p>

<p>May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother.</p>

<p>Hasten his musters and conduct his powers.</p>

<p>I must change names at home and give the distaff</p>

<p>Into my husband’s hands. This trusty servant</p>

<p>Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to</p>

<p>hear–</p>

<p>If you dare venture in your own behalf–</p>

<p>A mistress’s command. Wear this; spare speech.</p>

<p><center><i>[She gives him a favor.]</i></center></p>

<p>Decline your head. <i>[She kisses him.]</i> This kiss, if it</p>

<p>durst speak,</p>

<p>Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.</p>

<p>Conceive, and fare thee well.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edmund</span></p>

<p>Yours in the ranks of death.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span>  My most dear</p>

<p>Gloucester!</p>

<p>O, the difference of man and man!</p>

<p>To thee a woman’s services are due;</p>

<p>My fool usurps my body.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Oswald</span>  Madam, here comes my lord.     <i><i>[He exits.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Albany.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span></p>

<p>I have been worth the whistle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span>  O Goneril,</p>

<p>You are not worth the dust which the rude wind</p>

<p>Blows in your face. I fear your disposition.</p>

<p>That nature which contemns its origin</p>

<p>Cannot be bordered certain in itself.</p>

<p>She that herself will sliver and disbranch</p>

<p>From her material sap perforce must wither</p>

<p>And come to deadly use.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span>  No more. The text is foolish.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span></p>

<p>Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile.</p>

<p>Filths savor but themselves. What have you done?</p>

<p>Tigers, not daughters, what have you performed?</p>

<p>A father, and a gracious aged man,</p>

<p>Whose reverence even the head-lugged bear would</p>

<p>lick,</p>

<p>Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you</p>

<p>madded.</p>

<p>Could my good brother suffer you to do it?</p>

<p>A man, a prince, by him so benefited!</p>

<p>If that the heavens do not their visible spirits</p>

<p>Send quickly down to tame these vile offenses,</p>

<p>It will come:</p>

<p>Humanity must perforce prey on itself,</p>

<p>Like monsters of the deep.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span>  Milk-livered man,</p>

<p>That bear’st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;</p>

<p>Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning</p>

<p>Thine honor from thy suffering; that not know’st</p>

<p>Fools do those villains pity who are punished</p>

<p>Ere they have done their mischief. Where’s thy</p>

<p>drum?</p>

<p>France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,</p>

<p>With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,</p>

<p>Whilst thou, a moral fool, sits still and cries</p>

<p>“Alack, why does he so?”</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span>  See thyself, devil!</p>

<p>Proper deformity shows not in the fiend</p>

<p>So horrid as in woman.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span>  O vain fool!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span></p>

<p>Thou changed and self-covered thing, for shame</p>

<p>Bemonster not thy feature. Were ’t my fitness</p>

<p>To let these hands obey my blood,</p>

<p>They are apt enough to dislocate and tear</p>

<p>Thy flesh and bones. Howe’er thou art a fiend,</p>

<p>A woman’s shape doth shield thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span>  Marry, your manhood, mew–</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter a Messenger.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span>  What news?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead,</p>

<p>Slain by his servant, going to put out</p>

<p>The other eye of Gloucester.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span>  Gloucester’s eyes?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>A servant that he bred, thrilled with remorse,</p>

<p>Opposed against the act, bending his sword</p>

<p>To his great master, who, thereat enraged,</p>

<p>Flew on him and amongst them felled him dead,</p>

<p>But not without that harmful stroke which since</p>

<p>Hath plucked him after.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span>  This shows you are above,</p>

<p>You justicers, that these our nether crimes</p>

<p>So speedily can venge. But, O poor Gloucester,</p>

<p>Lost he his other eye?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span>  Both, both, my lord.–</p>

<p>This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.</p>

<p><center><i>[Giving her a paper.]</i></center></p>

<p>’Tis from your sister.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Goneril</span> <i>[aside]</i>  One way I like this well.</p>

<p>But being widow and my Gloucester with her</p>

<p>May all the building in my fancy pluck</p>

<p>Upon my hateful life. Another way</p>

<p>The news is not so tart.–I’ll read, and answer.</p>

<p><center><i>[She exits.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span></p>

<p>Where was his son when they did take his eyes?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Come with my lady hither.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span>  He is not here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>No, my good lord. I met him back again.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span>  Knows he the wickedness?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Messenger</span></p>

<p>Ay, my good lord. ’Twas he informed against him</p>

<p>And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment</p>

<p>Might have the freer course.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Albany</span>  Gloucester, I live</p>

<p>To thank thee for the love thou show’d’st the King,</p>

<p>And to revenge thine eyes.–Come hither, friend.</p>

<p>Tell me what more thou know’st.</p>

<p><center><i>[They exit.]</i></center></p>
