<p><center><i>[Enter Kent in disguise and a Gentleman.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Why the King of France is so suddenly gone</p>

<p>back know you no reason?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Something he left imperfect in the state,</p>

<p>which since his coming forth is thought of, which</p>

<p>imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger</p>

<p>that his personal return was most required and</p>

<p>necessary.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Who hath he left behind him general?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration</p>

<p>of grief?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Ay, sir, she took them, read them in my</p>

<p>presence,</p>

<p>And now and then an ample tear trilled down</p>

<p>Her delicate cheek. It seemed she was a queen</p>

<p>Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,</p>

<p>Fought to be king o’er her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  O, then it moved her.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove</p>

<p>Who should express her goodliest. You have seen</p>

<p>Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears</p>

<p>Were like a better way. Those happy smilets</p>

<p>That played on her ripe lip seemed not to know</p>

<p>What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence</p>

<p>As pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief,</p>

<p>Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved</p>

<p>If all could so become it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Made she no verbal question?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span></p>

<p>Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of</p>

<p>“father”</p>

<p>Pantingly forth, as if it pressed her heart;</p>

<p>Cried “Sisters, sisters, shame of ladies, sisters!</p>

<p>Kent, father, sisters! What, i’ th’ storm, i’ th’ night?</p>

<p>Let pity not be believed!” There she shook</p>

<p>The holy water from her heavenly eyes,</p>

<p>And clamor moistened. Then away she started,</p>

<p>To deal with grief alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  It is the stars.</p>

<p>The stars above us govern our conditions,</p>

<p>Else one self mate and make could not beget</p>

<p>Such different issues. You spoke not with her</p>

<p>since?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  No.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Was this before the King returned?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  No, since.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear’s i’ th’ town,</p>

<p>Who sometime in his better tune remembers</p>

<p>What we are come about, and by no means</p>

<p>Will yield to see his daughter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Why, good sir?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>A sovereign shame so elbows him–his own</p>

<p>unkindness,</p>

<p>That stripped her from his benediction, turned her</p>

<p>To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights</p>

<p>To his dog-hearted daughters–these things sting</p>

<p>His mind so venomously that burning shame</p>

<p>Detains him from Cordelia.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  Alack, poor gentleman!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gentleman</span>  ’Tis so. They are afoot.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear</p>

<p>And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause</p>

<p>Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.</p>

<p>When I am known aright, you shall not grieve</p>

<p>Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go</p>

<p>Along with me.</p>
