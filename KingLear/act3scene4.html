<p><center><i>[Enter Lear, Kent in disguise, and Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.</p>

<p>The tyranny of the open night ’s too rough</p>

<p>For nature to endure.     <i><i>[Storm still.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Let me alone.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Good my lord, enter here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Wilt break my heart?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm</p>

<p>Invades us to the skin. So ’tis to thee.</p>

<p>But where the greater malady is fixed,</p>

<p>The lesser is scarce felt. Thou ’dst shun a bear,</p>

<p>But if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea,</p>

<p>Thou ’dst meet the bear i’ th’ mouth. When the</p>

<p>mind’s free,</p>

<p>The body’s delicate. This tempest in my mind</p>

<p>Doth from my senses take all feeling else</p>

<p>Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!</p>

<p>Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand</p>

<p>For lifting food to ’t? But I will punish home.</p>

<p>No, I will weep no more. In such a night</p>

<p>To shut me out? Pour on. I will endure.</p>

<p>In such a night as this? O Regan, Goneril,</p>

<p>Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all!</p>

<p>O, that way madness lies. Let me shun that;</p>

<p>No more of that.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Good my lord, enter here.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>Prithee, go in thyself. Seek thine own ease.</p>

<p>This tempest will not give me leave to ponder</p>

<p>On things would hurt me more. But I’ll go in.–</p>

<p>In, boy; go first.–You houseless poverty–</p>

<p>Nay, get thee in. I’ll pray, and then I’ll sleep.</p>

<p><center><i>[Fool exits.]</i></center></p>

<p>Poor naked wretches, wheresoe’er you are,</p>

<p>That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,</p>

<p>How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,</p>

<p>Your looped and windowed raggedness defend</p>

<p>you</p>

<p>From seasons such as these? O, I have ta’en</p>

<p>Too little care of this. Take physic, pomp.</p>

<p>Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,</p>

<p>That thou may’st shake the superflux to them</p>

<p>And show the heavens more just.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span> <i>[within]</i>  Fathom and half, fathom and half!</p>

<p>Poor Tom!</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Fool.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Come not in here, nuncle; here’s a spirit. Help</p>

<p>me, help me!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Give me thy hand. Who’s there?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  A spirit, a spirit! He says his name’s Poor Tom.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  What art thou that dost grumble there i’ th’</p>

<p>straw? Come forth.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Edgar in disguise.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  Away. The foul fiend follows me. Through the</p>

<p>sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind. Hum! Go to</p>

<p>thy cold bed and warm thee.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Didst thou give all to thy daughters? And art thou</p>

<p>come to this?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  Who gives anything to Poor Tom, whom the</p>

<p>foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame,</p>

<p>through ford and whirlpool, o’er bog and quagmire;</p>

<p>that hath laid knives under his pillow and</p>

<p>halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge,</p>

<p>made him proud of heart to ride on a bay trotting</p>

<p>horse over four-inched bridges to course his own</p>

<p>shadow for a traitor? Bless thy five wits! Tom’s</p>

<p>a-cold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from</p>

<p>whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do Poor Tom</p>

<p>some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. There</p>

<p>could I have him now, and there–and there again</p>

<p>–and there.     <i><i>[Storm still.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>Has his daughters brought him to this pass?–</p>

<p>Couldst thou save nothing? Wouldst thou give ’em</p>

<p>all?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all</p>

<p>shamed.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air</p>

<p>Hang fated o’er men’s faults light on thy daughters!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  He hath no daughters, sir.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>Death, traitor! Nothing could have subdued nature</p>

<p>To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.</p>

<p>Is it the fashion that discarded fathers</p>

<p>Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?</p>

<p>Judicious punishment! ’Twas this flesh begot</p>

<p>Those pelican daughters.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  Pillicock sat on Pillicock Hill. Alow, alow, loo,</p>

<p>loo.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  This cold night will turn us all to fools and</p>

<p>madmen.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  Take heed o’ th’ foul fiend. Obey thy parents,</p>

<p>keep thy word’s justice, swear not, commit not with</p>

<p>man’s sworn spouse, set not thy sweet heart on</p>

<p>proud array. Tom’s a-cold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  What hast thou been?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  A servingman, proud in heart and mind, that</p>

<p>curled my hair, wore gloves in my cap, served the</p>

<p>lust of my mistress’ heart and did the act of</p>

<p>darkness with her, swore as many oaths as I spake</p>

<p>words and broke them in the sweet face of heaven;</p>

<p>one that slept in the contriving of lust and waked to</p>

<p>do it. Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in</p>

<p>woman out-paramoured the Turk. False of heart,</p>

<p>light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in</p>

<p>stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in</p>

<p>prey. Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling</p>

<p>of silks betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy</p>

<p>foot out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy</p>

<p>pen from lenders’ books, and defy the foul fiend.</p>

<p>Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind;</p>

<p>says suum, mun, nonny. Dolphin my boy, boy, sessa!</p>

<p>Let him trot by.     <i><i>[Storm still.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Thou wert better in a grave than to answer with</p>

<p>thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.–Is</p>

<p>man no more than this? Consider him well.–Thou</p>

<p>ow’st the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep</p>

<p>no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha, here’s three on ’s</p>

<p>are sophisticated. Thou art the thing itself; unaccommodated</p>

<p>man is no more but such a poor, bare,</p>

<p>forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!</p>

<p>Come, unbutton here.     <i><i>[Tearing off his clothes.]</i></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Fool</span>  Prithee, nuncle, be contented. ’Tis a naughty</p>

<p>night to swim in. Now, a little fire in a wild field</p>

<p>were like an old lecher’s heart–a small spark, all</p>

<p>the rest on ’s body cold.</p>

<br/>

<p><center><i>[Enter Gloucester, with a torch.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p>Look, here comes a walking fire.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins</p>

<p>at curfew and walks till the first cock. He</p>

<p>gives the web and the pin, squints the eye, and</p>

<p>makes the harelip, mildews the white wheat, and</p>

<p>hurts the poor creature of earth.</p>

<p>     <i>Swithold footed thrice the ’old,</i></p>

<p>     <i>He met the nightmare and her ninefold,</i></p>

<p>        <i>Bid her alight,</i></p>

<p>        <i>And her troth plight,</i></p>

<p>     <i>And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  How fares your Grace?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  What’s he?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  Who’s there? What is ’t you seek?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  What are you there? Your names?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the</p>

<p>toad, the tadpole, the wall newt, and the water;</p>

<p>that, in the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend</p>

<p>rages, eats cow dung for sallets, swallows the old</p>

<p>rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of</p>

<p>the standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to</p>

<p>tithing, and stocked, punished, and imprisoned;</p>

<p>who hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to</p>

<p>his body,</p>

<p>     <i>Horse to ride, and weapon to wear;</i></p>

<p>     <i>But mice and rats and such small deer</i></p>

<p>     <i>Have been Tom’s food for seven long year.</i></p>

<p>Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! Peace, thou</p>

<p>fiend!</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span> <i>[to Lear]</i></p>

<p>What, hath your Grace no better company?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman. Modo</p>

<p>he’s called, and Mahu.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span> <i>[to Lear]</i></p>

<p>Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile</p>

<p>That it doth hate what gets it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  Poor Tom’s a-cold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span> <i>[to Lear]</i></p>

<p>Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer</p>

<p>T’ obey in all your daughters’ hard commands.</p>

<p>Though their injunction be to bar my doors</p>

<p>And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,</p>

<p>Yet have I ventured to come seek you out</p>

<p>And bring you where both fire and food is ready.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>First let me talk with this philosopher.</p>

<p><i>[To Edgar.]</i> What is the cause of thunder?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span></p>

<p>Good my lord, take his offer; go into th’ house.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span></p>

<p>I’ll talk a word with this same learned Theban.–</p>

<p>What is your study?</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Let me ask you one word in private.</p>

<p><center><i>[They talk aside.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span> <i>[to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>Importune him once more to go, my lord.</p>

<p>His wits begin t’ unsettle.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  Canst thou blame him?</p>

<p><center><i>[Storm still.]</i></center></p>

<p>His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!</p>

<p>He said it would be thus, poor banished man.</p>

<p>Thou sayest the King grows mad; I’ll tell thee,</p>

<p>friend,</p>

<p>I am almost mad myself. I had a son,</p>

<p>Now outlawed from my blood. He sought my life</p>

<p>But lately, very late. I loved him, friend,</p>

<p>No father his son dearer. True to tell thee,</p>

<p>The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night’s this!</p>

<p>–I do beseech your Grace–</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  O, cry you mercy, sir.</p>

<p><i>[To Edgar.]</i> Noble philosopher, your company.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span>  Tom’s a-cold.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span> <i>[to Edgar]</i></p>

<p>In fellow, there, into th’ hovel. Keep thee warm.</p>

<br/>

<p>LEARCome, let’s in all.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span>  This way, my lord.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span> <i>[indicating Edgar]</i>  With him.</p>

<p>I will keep still with my philosopher.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span> <i>[to Gloucester]</i></p>

<p>Good my lord, soothe him. Let him take the fellow.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span> <i>[to Kent]</i>  Take him you on.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Kent</span> <i>[to Edgar]</i></p>

<p>Sirrah, come on: go along with us.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Lear</span>  Come, good Athenian.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>  No words, no words. Hush.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class='sc'>Edgar</span></p>

<p>     <i>Child Rowland to the dark tower came.</i></p>

<p>     <i>His word was still “Fie, foh, and fum,</i></p>
