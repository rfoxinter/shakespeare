<p><center><i>[Enter Goneril and Oswald, her Steward.]</i></center></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc>  Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding</p>

<p>of his Fool?</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oswald</sc>  Ay, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc></p>

<p>By day and night he wrongs me. Every hour</p>

<p>He flashes into one gross crime or other</p>

<p>That sets us all at odds. I’ll not endure it.</p>

<p>His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us</p>

<p>On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,</p>

<p>I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.</p>

<p>If you come slack of former services,</p>

<p>You shall do well. The fault of it I’ll answer.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oswald</sc>  He’s coming, madam. I hear him.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc></p>

<p>Put on what weary negligence you please,</p>

<p>You and your fellows. I’d have it come to question.</p>

<p>If he distaste it, let him to my sister,</p>

<p>Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,</p>

<p>Not to be overruled. Idle old man</p>

<p>That still would manage those authorities</p>

<p>That he hath given away. Now, by my life,</p>

<p>Old fools are babes again and must be used</p>

<p>With checks as flatteries, when they are seen</p>

<p>abused.</p>

<p>Remember what I have said.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Oswald</sc>  Well, madam.</p>

<br/>

<p><sc>Goneril</sc></p>

<p>And let his knights have colder looks among you.</p>

<p>What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so.</p>

<p>I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,</p>

<p>That I may speak. I’ll write straight to my sister</p>

<p>To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.</p>
